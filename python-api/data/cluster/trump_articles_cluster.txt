            "fullContent": "As the 2024 US presidential election comes to a close, and with Donald Trump on the ballot once again, Russian actors are spreading disinformation with unprecedented and alarming intensity—and US officials say that the Kremlin’s efforts to undermine confidence in the election and foment unrest are likely to continue into January. Russian disinformation operations have had a prominent presence in United States elections since the Kremlin’s sea-changing influence campaign during the 2016 presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Trump. But with so much scrutiny and investigation into that operation’s mechanics and impact—including the use of hack-and-leak tactics against the Democratic National Committee, Clinton campaign, and other targets—Russia was less technically aggressive and more focused on influence operations in the midterms and 2020 presidential election. That momentary respite is now over. In calls with reporters on Monday night and Tuesday, as well as in public statements, US intelligence and law enforcement officials working on election security warned repeatedly that foreign influence actors including Iran, but “particularly Russia,” are ramping up their activity with an “increasing volume of inauthentic content online.” And while officials say they haven't detected cyberattacks beyond floods of junk traffic, or DDoS attacks, attempting to knock election-related sites offline, Russian activity has become increasingly menacing. On Tuesday morning, for example, Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger attributed multiple bomb threats against two Georgia polling places to Russia. The threats were deemed non-credible, but they briefly disrupted voting at the two poll sites. The FBI added later on Tuesday that poll sites in “several states” faced non-credible bomb threats that appeared to “originate from Russian email domains.” “It is a greater scope and scale of foreign influence operations we have seen in 2024 than in prior cycles, and yes, Russia presents, in terms of our adversaries, the greatest degree of capability and sophistication,” Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), told reporters in a call on Tuesday afternoon. “Overall, I think the range of tactics we are seeing being employed, and the level of sophistication, is greater than prior cycles.” In a joint statement on Monday evening, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, CISA, and the FBI emphasized that “Russia is the most active threat” to the US election. “Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences,” they wrote. The agencies cited some specific examples of content from Russian influence campaigns. One was a fake interview with someone purporting to be a former aide to Arizona secretary of state Adrian Fontes, claiming a vast election fraud campaign involving the manufacture of fake overseas ballots. Another involved alleged Russian influence actors amplifying an article that falsely claimed US officials in swing states were committing election fraud using a variety of tactics, including ballot stuffing and cyberattacks. A video claiming to show evidence of fraud in Georgia was also linked to “Russian influence actors” in late September. Last month, experts also credited Russia-aligned propaganda network Storm-1516 with amplifying baseless claims that Minnesota governor and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz previously assaulted one of his former students.   In a press release on Tuesday morning, the FBI also warned about two videos circulating online featuring fake press releases purporting to be from the bureau. Officials did not attribute the videos to a specific actor but said that both are “promoting false narratives surrounding the election.” One claims to be a terrorist warning from the FBI urging Americans to “vote remotely” due to “a high terror threat at polling stations.” The second video also contains a fabricated FBI press release and claims that the management of five prisons in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona “rigged inmate voting and colluded with a political party.” US government officials have called out Russian influence operations and other foreign malign activity surrounding elections before, but never with the speed and consistency of this election cycle. The FBI has been putting out multiple alerts a week in recent weeks, and CISA alone is holding four briefings with the press on Tuesday along with an Election Threat Updates landing page to centralize information. “It’s reassuring to see the attribution process move so quickly,” says John Hultquist, who leads threat intelligence at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant. “More than anything, the speed suggests a strong familiarity with threat actors who may be struggling to carry out a serious surprise and hide their hand in these operations. It’s important to expose these operations while taking care not to give them a boost. The biggest struggle for these actors is almost always their ability to generate attention.” As CISA’s Conley told reporters, US foreign adversaries are focused on “undermining American confidence in American democracy and pitting Americans against one another … With all of the noise and disinformation out there, what Americans need to realize is that your state and local election official is the signal through that noise. That is your source for authoritative information on election security—on election administration. So if there are questions, that is who the American people should be turning to for the authoritative answers.”  You can follow all of WIRED's 2024 presidential election coverage here."

            "fullContent": "Many Black Americans across the country have reported receiving text messages over recent days telling them they’re now slaves and will be picking cotton. The shocking messages have come from a variety of numbers and it’s not clear who’s sending them, but they seem to have only started after Donald Trump was declared the winner of this week’s presidential election. Whoever’s behind the nationwide troll, they know how depressed and scared many Americans are about Trump’s racist, neofascist policies.  The messages tell people they’re going to pick cotton and should be prepared to do that soon, though there are slightly different wording variations on that same theme. One reads: “Greeting, You have been selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation. Be ready to b 5:00 pm est. Executive Slaves will come get you in a Black van, Be prepared to be searched down once you enter the plantation[.] You are Plantation Group 4.” Other messages explicitly mention Trump.  My bestie just received this— they want her to pick cotton like a slave this weekend. To say I’m angry would be an understatement pic.twitter.com/LkXUyL0ZPY  — Allison Wiltz Psy.M. (@queenie4rmnola) November 8, 2024   The messages have reportedly been received in Minnesota, Alabama, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Louisiana, and New York, among plenty of others. While it’s not clear how the phone numbers of Black people are being singled out specifically, CNN reports the person or group of people behind this have been using TextNow, a service for sending text messages popular with scammers. TextNow told CNN they’ve disabled the accounts known to have sent the threatening messages, though there are plenty of other services available for this kind of mass-texting operation. “The FBI is aware of the offensive and racist text messages sent to individuals around the country and is in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities on the matter,” the FBI said in a statement posted to its website Thursday. “As always, we encourage members of the public to report threats of physical violence to local law enforcement authorities,” the short statement concludes.   The CEO of the NAACP drew a direct line to these racist messages and what Trump has been saying during his presidential campaign. Trump has been spreading vile conspiracy theories about immigrants and has said some of the most racist things of any presidential candidate in the 21st century. “The unfortunate reality of electing a president who, historically, has embraced and at times encouraged hate, is unfolding before our eyes,” NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson told CNN. “These messages represent an alarming increase in vile and abhorrent rhetoric from racist groups across the country, who now feel emboldened to spread hate and stoke the flames of fear that many of us are feeling after Tuesday’s election results.” Trump was declared the winner of the presidential election in the early morning hours of Wednesday and any decent person is obviously stressed out right now about what the future looks like. Trump has promised to deport millions of immigrants, has said he’ll become a dictator on day one, and has said he’ll use the military against his political enemies. Things are about to get really bad. And mass texts with racist messages may just be a joke by psychotic trolls right now. But the darker elements of Trump’s agenda aren’t just going to be texts in the near future."

            "fullContent": "Last week a squirrel died in New York. Over the weekend, the squirrel became a symbol and martyr on the right. As people line up to vote, ballots are cast, and undecided voters make their final decisions on who to vote for, Donald Trump’s surrogates like Elon Musk are tweeting about a squirrel.  Vote For PNut!For Liberty!For Freedom! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 4, 2024   P’Nut the squirrel was internet famous. Mark Longo rescued it seven years ago and raised it after its mother died. P’Nut had an Instagram account and Longo had an OnlyFans account named for the squirrel, though P’Nut was not involved in the sultry shoots. On October 30, the Department of Environmental Conservation in New York raided Longo’s home and seized P’Nut and a raccoon. P’Nut allegedly bit one of the officers during the raid. DEC then euthanized the squirrel to test for rabies.\nP’Nut captured the imagination of the right, especially the extremely online right, in the waning days of the election. Here, they said, was an example of Democratic government overreach. Longo, upset about the death of his beloved P’Nut, fueled the fire. “They treated me like I was a terrorist. They treated this raid as if I was a drug dealer. They ransacked my house for five hours. They asked my wife, who is of German descent, what her immigration status was. They asked if I had cameras in my house. They wouldn’t allow me to go to the bathroom without a police escort, who then checked the back of the toilet to see if I was hiding anything there,” Longo told the New York Post.  ©Image via X.  The Post has published multiple stories about the squirrel since the raid. The Editorial Board of The Wall Street Journal penned an op-ed about state power and P’Nut. The House Judiciary GOP posted “Justice for Peanut” on its X account. Elon Musk posted about the squirrel an absurd number of times over the weekend and, as of this writing, his pinned tweet is a call to vote for P’Nut. A fake statement from the Trump campaign about the dead squirrel went viral but was quickly debunked by the campaign itself.\n Justice for Peanut. — House Judiciary GOP 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 (@JudiciaryGOP) November 2, 2024   The memes flowed. Right-wing stalwart cartoonist Ben Garrison immortalized P’Nut in a post on X. In the cartoon, the squirrel is wearing a cowboy hat, one of his trademarks, and sporting a sign that reads “Vote Trump!” P’Nut looks at the viewer, his large cartoon eyes welling with tears, shouting “Avenge me!” Another meme depicted a ghostly squirrel with its arms on Trump’s shoulders as he sits in the Oval Office. Others show P’Nut in heaven with Harambe, a beloved gorilla who died in 2016 and became a meme superstar.\n \"Peanut the Squirrel…You shall be avenged!\"On Nov 5th! Vote Trump don't let Peanut die in vain!Ben Garrison Cartoon Feel free to share this image far and wide!!RIP Peanut! pic.twitter.com/8hsgiKSkNx  — Real Ben Garrison Cartoons (@GrrrGraphics) November 2, 2024   There was a sense from the right online that the squirrel signaled the end of Kamala Harris and the Democrats. Here was a clear violation of a person’s rights and the perfect martyr for their cause. “Are we going to win this election because of this f’ing squirrel?” Mike Benze, Executive Director of Foundation For Freedom Online said in a post on X.\nWell, no. Should Trump win it won’t be because of a last-minute bump from people upset that the state of New York killed an internet-famous squirrel. P’Nut is yet another symptom of the terminally online insanity that has plagued the GOP in recent years. Part of what ended Ron DeSantis’s bid for the Presidential nomination in January was his staff’s infatuation with weird online culture war bullshit. He obsessed over Disney which read as weak and weird to normal voters. The final nail in the coffin occurred when one of his too-online staffers published a fascist fancam. And Trump is even losing the extremely online fascist vote. On November 2, white nationalist groyper Nick Fuentes said he’d realized Trumpism is a cult. Fuentes finally lost faith in Trump after seeing his supporters dress up like garbage.\nThe garbage thing isn’t playing well with Puerto Ricans either. After a comedian opened Trump’s recent Madison Square Garden rally with a racist joke that called Puerto Rico an “island of garbage” and Biden gaffed and called Trump supporters “garbage” (a comment he claims was misheard), the GOP attempted to reclaim the label. Trump supporters dressed up like garbage and Trump himself did a photo-op in a garbage truck. Trump distanced himself from the comedian while attempting to embrace the image of his followers as garbage. It hasn’t landed. The Huffington Post sent a journalist to the swing state of Pennsylvania to talk to Puerto Rican voters. One man told HuffPo that he’d never voted before but decided to do so after hearing the comedian’s joke. He saw the garbage truck photo-op as an insult. “If he didn’t have nothing to do with it, what’s he doing in the garbage truck?” He told HuffPo.\nIf Trump loses this election it will be, in part, because his campaign lost itself in the sauce of the online world. As the election entered the final stretch, Trump and his team spent their days tweeting about squirrels and garbage. It’s not a compelling pitch."

            "fullContent": "Do you remember Bryan Johnson, the 47-year-old venture capitalist who wants to say as young as possible for as long as possible? The guy who uses his son’s blood in that effort? Well, he’s got a line of supplements. And he says they’re the bee’s knees.  “I spent $50,000 last month alone testing foods for heavy metals, toxins and nutritional density and can confirm what Chamath is saying: the American food supply is egregiously unhealthy,” Johnson wrote Sunday on X.   Chamath, in this case, is referring to Chamath Palihapitiya, the venture capitalist and co-host of the All-In podcast, who wrote over the weekend about how he thought food was just healthier in Italy than in the U.S. Not because he was eating anything with less fat or calories. Palihapitiya believes there’s something more insidious going on with the U.S. food supply. And Johnson took the opportunity to tout his brand of supplements, known as Blueprint.\n “It took us (Blueprint) 18 months to build out an entire food supply chain, vetting every vendor and testing every ingredient,” Johnson continued. “All third party lab results are shared publicly. It’s such a relief to have knowledge of what I’m putting into my body. It’s worth noting that we’ve been testing “healthy” ingredients, not even fast food or junk food which I’m guessing is a lot worse.”  Johnson, who made his money selling his company Braintree to PayPal back in 2013, is obsessed with aging, to say the least. And it’s really no surprise when a guy with extreme wealth (Johnson is worth an estimated $400 million according to Fortune) decides that he wants to live forever. But typically those kinds of people are locked in to their own experience. Johnson, whatever you think of him, seems to be on a mission to spread his ideas far and wide, selling supplements and powders in the process, including things like “Longevity Mix” and pills containing red yeast rice with garlic.\nThere’s even a Donald Trump connection to Johnson’s efforts if you can believe it. On Friday, Johnson posted a photo of himself with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the man who has been tasked with overseeing the incoming Trump administration’s plans for everything health-related, from the USDA to the FDA.  MAHA pic.twitter.com/WDyntKdzTB  — Bryan Johnson /dd (@bryan_johnson) November 8, 2024  \nJohnson wrote “MAHA,” which stands for Make America Healthy Again. And he really seems to mean it. When asked in the comments on X about the meeting, Johnson said he and Kennedy “worked out, ate Nutty Pudding, and completed biological age tests.” Nutty Pudding, of course, is a product Johnson sells on his website.  It’s unclear what impact Johnson and his ideas of eternal life might have on the federal government, especially if he’s buddies with Kennedy. Will Medicare stop paying for life-saving cancer drugs so that we can all get on brain pills and longevity powders? The idea would’ve been cartoonishly ridiculous before last week’s presidential election. But now that Trump will be returning to the White House on Jan. 20, 2025, and Kennedy plans to bring his rag-tag bunch of alt-health weirdos along with him, we could be in for anything at this point.\nAn attempt to reach Johnson through his website didn’t immediately receive a response. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back."
