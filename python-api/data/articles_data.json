If you want small businesses and startups to succeed, you want a stable, predictable market where big companies can't just snuff you out, not by issuing a better product, but just throwing their weight around to stop you.

        "title": "Georgia lawmakers won't seek student database after deadly high school shooting",
        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence\n\nATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence, even as they push forward other parts of a school safety bill aimed at preventing a school shooting like the one in September at Apalachee High School.\n\nHouse and Senate lawmakers unveiled a compromise version of House Bill 268 on Thursday, which then passed the Senate Judiciary committee unanimously. That sets it up for final passage in the closing days of Georgia's 2025 legislative session.\n\nThe push to share information was driven by the belief among many that the Barrow County school system didn’t have a full picture of the warning signs displayed by the 14-year-old accused in the fatal shootings of two students and two teachers. But there was loud opposition from both Democratic and Republican constituencies that the database would create a permanent blacklist with no due process that could treat racial and religious minorities unfairly.\n\n“The reason it wasn’t going to fly was pushback from all points of the political spectrum that worried about their child being stigmatized just for an accusation or an uncorroborated complaint,” said Sen. Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican representing parts of Barrow County.\n\nThe compromise version also removed a requirement that all school systems set up formal threat management teams to evaluate whether students may commit violence. That approach is strongly recommended by many national experts, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency already offers training. House Education Committee Chairman Chris Erwin, a Republican from Homer, said he was hopeful schools would voluntarily adopt the model.\n\n“I think there is a knowledge out there of the importance of planning and preparing already in schools,” Erwin said. “So having a full model structure for the state isn’t as important as maybe we once thought it was.”\n\nThe measure would still require police agencies to report to schools when officers learn that a child has threatened death or injury to someone at a school. But those reports aren't mandated to become part of a student's educational record and wouldn't travel with a student if they transfer to another district.\n\nThat raises questions about whether the bill addresses one of the key criticisms that followed the Apalachee shooting. School officials never became aware that a sheriff's deputy in Jackson County had interviewed Colt Gray in May 2023 after the FBI passed along a tip that Gray might have posted a shooting threat online. That report would have been forwarded to middle school officials in Jackson County under the bill, but wouldn't have followed Gray when he enrolled as a freshman in nearby Barrow County after skipping eighth grade entirely.\n\nThe bill also mandates quicker transfers of records when a student enters a new school, creates at least one new position to help coordinate mental health treatment for students in each of Georgia’s 180 school districts and sets up an anonymous reporting system statewide.\n\nLawmakers on Thursday added in features of separate Senate bills that had passed. They would mandate that all Georgia public schools provide wearable panic buttons to employees. Public schools would also be required to submit electronic maps of their campuses to local, state and federal agencies once a year.\n\nThe amended bill would also make adult prosecution the default when children aged 13 to 16 are charged with terroristic acts at school, any aggravated assault with a gun, or attempted murder. The Senate had originally proposed a broader range of crimes when adult prosecution would be the default. House leaders had said they didn't want to submit any more juveniles to adult prosecution.",

Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe firms' legal challenges against what they have described as blatantly \"unconstitutional\" executive orders come on the heels of successful effort by the law firm Perkins Coie, which earlier this month secured a court order blocking similar executive action signed by Trump.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed in federal court in D.C. on Friday, accuse Trump of engaging in a sweeping campaign to intimidate major law firms who have represented plaintiffs currently suing the administration, or who have represented or at one point employed those he dislikes.\n\n\"These orders send a clear message to the legal profession: Cease certain representations adverse to the government and renounce the Administration's critics -- or suffer the consequences,\" the Jenner and Block suit said. \"The orders also attempt to pressure businesses and individuals to question or even abandon their associations with their chosen counsel, and to chill bringing legal challenges at all.\"\n\nBoth lawsuits were initially assigned Friday to D.C. District judge Beryl Howell, who previously enjoined the Trump administration from enforcing its executive order against the law firm Perkins Coie -- and described it as very likely unconstitutional. But on Friday afternoon, Howell ordered them to be randomly reassigned to a different judge -- noting they raise separate factual and legal questions than the Perkins Coie case.\n\nEarlier this week, Howell rejected an effort from the Trump administration to have her removed from overseeing the Perkins Coie lawsuit after they argued she showed clear bias against Trump.",

Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\n\nWhile testifying at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday, Gabbard initially declined to answer questions about the group chat, even declining to confirm if she was part of it, saying, \"I'm not going to get into specifics because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.\"\n\nBut later in the hearing, Gabbard told the Senate committee members, \"There was no classified material that was shared in the Signal chat.\"\n\nSeated next to Gabbard on Tuesday, CIA Director John Radcliffe immediately confirmed that he was part of the group chat when asked.\n\n\"So, my communications, to be clear, in a Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information, to be clear,\" Radcliffe said.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., asked both Gabbard and Radcliffe to answer a series of questions about the contents of the group chat, including whether military units, weapons and timing were mentioned.\n\nBoth Gabbard and Radcliffe answered that they could not recall if those subjects came up. When pressed by Kelly, Gabbard later said, \"I believe there was a discussion around targets in general,\" and Radcliffe added, \"I think that's consistent with my recollection.\"\n\nIn a social media post on X Wednesday, Hegseth slammed The Atlantic's reporting, saying, \"The Atlantic released so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information.\"\n\nIn an interview Tuesday night on \"The VINCE Show\" -- a conservative talk radio program hosted by Vince Coglianese -- Trump highlighted the success of the Yemen attack and said, \"No, and there weren't details, and there was nothing in there that was compromised, and it had no impact on the attack, which was very successful.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X Wednesday, noting that The Atlantic's headline on its follow-up article referred to \"attack plans\" instead of \"war plans\" the magazine initially reported.\n\n\"The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT 'war plans,'\" Leavitt wrote in her post. \"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well known for his sensationalist spin.\"\n\nGoldberg and The Atlantic reported that they \"held back specific information related to weapons and to the timing of the attacks that we found in certain texts.\" But The Atlantic said it decided to release Hegseth's text messages stating the types of weapons used and the timing of the strike to counter claims from Trump officials that no classified information was released in what it described in the article as \"a massive Trump-administration security breach.\"\n\n\"The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump -- combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts -- have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions,\" the magazine's follow-up article reads.\n\nWas it wrong to conduct such a chat on the Signal app?\n\nIn his testimony Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ratcliffe said Signal was appropriately used by the group involved in the chat, including Vice President JD Vance.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Mike Waltz speaks during a meeting with President Donald Trump and US Ambassadors in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, DC, March 25, 2025. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"So that we’re clear, one of the first things that happened when I was confirmed as CIA Director was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA, as it is for most CIA officers,\" Ratcliffe said as he responded to questions from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \"One of the things that I was briefed on very early Senator was by the CIA Records Management folks about the use of Signal as a permissible work use. It is. That is a practice that preceded the current administration to the Biden administration.\"\n\nRatcliffe added, “It is an end-to-end encryption. It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided…provided Senator that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels. So those were procedures that were implemented. My staff implemented those processes, followed those processes, complied with those processes.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Ratcliffe told the House Intelligence Committee that there was no misuse of the Signal app.\n\n\"I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information,” Ratcliffe said. \"And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success.\"\n\nBut several former defense and intelligence officials told ABC News that such exchanges should have never been made in such a group chat. They insisted that an exact location of a strike isn't needed for information to be damaging to national security.\n\nThe details Hegseth shared in the chat were so sensitive that if leaked, they could have put troops carrying out the strike in danger because it gives the adversary time to prepare to fight back, the experts told ABC News.\n\n\"It was 100 percent classified,\" Darrell Blocker, a former CIA field operative and ABC News contributor, said of the reported text exchange, based on his three decades with a security clearance.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, Editor-in-Chief, The Atlantic, speaks with ABC News, Mar. 26, 2025. ABC News\n\nGabbard told the House Committee, \"The Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices. December of 2024, CISA [Certified Information Systems Auditor] stated, 'We strongly urge highly targeted individuals to immediately review and apply best practices provided in the guidance to protect mobile communications, including consistent use of end-to-end encrypted messaging apps.'\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Kane'ohe Bay, Hawaii, March 25, 2025. Senior Airman Madelyn Keechvia Reuters\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he didn't know anything about Signal and wasn't involved in the group chat.\n\n\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" Trump said. \"A lot of the military, I think, successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"\n\nHow was Goldberg invited to the chat?\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested that a staff member of national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently invited Goldberg to the group chat.\n\n\"And what it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody that was with Mike Waltz, worked for Mike Waltz at a lower level had, I guess Goldberg's number were called through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call,\" Trump said in an interview with Newsmax.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (L) accompanied by CIA Director John Ratcliffe (R), speaks during a Senate Committee on Intelligence Hearing, March 25, 2025, in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nBut during an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham Tuesday night, Waltz contradicted Trump's statement, saying he was the one who accidentally invited Goldberg to the chat.\n\n“Well, look, a staffer wasn't responsible. And look, I take full responsibility. I built the group,\" Waltz said, adding that the incident was \"embarrassing.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Gabbard told the House Intelligence Committee that it was \"a mistake\" to add Goldberg to the chat.\n\nDuring a news conference in Kingston, Jamaica, on Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that he, too, was on the Signal chat and added, \"Someone made a big mistake and added a journalist.\"\n\nWill there be an investigation?\n\nElon Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are reviewing how Goldberg was added to a Signal chat, a senior White House official told ABC News.\n\nIn his interview with Fox News Tuesday night, Waltz alluded to Musk's involvement, saying, \"I just talked to Elon on the way here -- we have the best technical minds looking at how this happened.\"\n\nThe White House official confirmed to ABC News that DOGE is involved and that the team is working with other teams to make communications \"more secure and efficient.\"\n\nLeavitt said on FOX News that in addition to Musk and his team, the National Security Council \"is all digging into this matter... to ensure this could never happen again.\"\n\nAsked by Sen. Warner during Tuesday's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing whether the FBI was investigating the matter, FBI Director Kash Patel, who was not part of the chat, said, \"Senator, I was just briefed about it late last night and this morning. I don't have an update.\"",

Vance and second lady Usha Vance arrived in Greenland on Friday for a scaled-back visit to the Pituffik Space Base.\n\nThe couple boarded Air Force Two shortly after 6 a.m. Eastern time and were joined on the trip by national security adviser Mike Waltz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee. The trip was originally planned as a visit by the second lady to attend a dogsled race, but that plan was scrapped after heavy criticism.\n\nJ.D. Vance was expected to deliver remarks and receive briefings at the Pituffik Space Base, according to a spokeswoman, and he and the second lady were set to greet U.S. service members stationed there.\n\nJ.D. Vance while meeting with service members noted he is the first vice president to visit Greenland, saying it is \"a pretty cool thing,\" before giving an overview of the visit.\n\nVice President JD Vance arrives at the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, Mar. 28, 2025.

We're going to get a briefing, of course, about, you know, what you guys do every day,\" he said.\n\n\"As you've heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration, so we're going to talk a little bit about that with our friends in the media,\" he added.\n\nThe vice president said he was told that assignment to the base was a one-year, unaccompanied assignment, meaning service members are not able to bring their families along.\n\n\"So I know it's a lot of sacrifices, spending a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" he added. \"The Trump administration, the president is really interested in Arctic security.

It's not a question of: Do you think we can do without it? We can't,\" he claimed in the Oval Office on Friday, saying Greenland is as vital to U.S. national security. \"If you look at Greenland right now, if you look at the waterways, you have Chinese and Russian ships all over the place, and we're not going to be able to do that.\n\n\"We're not relying on Denmark or anybody else to take care of that situation,\" he added. \"And we're not talking about peace for the United States.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance arrive at the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, March 28, 2025.

I think the European Union understands it. And if they don't, we're going to have to explain it to them.\"\n\nThe president made overtures about buying Greenland in his first term in office.\n\nIn a press release announcing the visit, Vance said, \"In the decades since neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past US administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"\n\nWright, who is also making the trip, told Fox News on Thursday that Greenland has tried for years to interest U.S. mining companies to develop resources there because there's not enough infrastructure to make mining economical.\n\n\"So, heck, maybe that is going to happen,\" he said. \"I think that is in the best interest of Greenland and Greenlanders and they have expressed that for years. If the United States can have the right cooperation, I think capital can flow there which would bring jobs and economic opportunity to Greenland and critical minerals and resources to the United States -- a win for both sides.\"\n\nThe idea of Greenland becoming part of the U.S. is opposed by many in Greenland and Denmark, of which Greenland is an autonomous territory.\n\nUsha Vance was originally scheduled to make the trip to learn about Greenland's cultural heritage and attend a national dogsled race before it was announced that the vice president, Waltz and Wright would join her. The trip was later scaled back to just a visit to the space base. The White House confirmed Thursday that Waltz will make the trip.\n\nJ.D.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nCHICAGO -- A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Labor from implementing parts of President Donald Trump’s executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients.\n\nJudge Matthew Kennelly of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois halted the Labor Department from requiring federal contractors or grant recipients from certifying that they don't operate any programs in violation of Trump's anti-DEI executive orders.\n\nThat certification provision has stepped up pressure on companies and other organizations to revisit their DEI practices because if the government were to determine they violated the provision, they would be subject to crippling financial penalties under the False Claims Act.\n\nThursday's ruling is in response to a lawsuit filed by Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit founded in 1981 that helps prepare women for work in skilled construction trades and has several contracts with the Department of Labor. There was no immediate reaction from Chicago Women in Trades to Kennelly's order. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA hearing on Chicago Women in Trades' bid for a longer-lasting halt on Trump's anti-DEI executive orders is scheduled for April 10.\n\nThe organization's lawsuit is one of several challenging Trump's executive orders targeting DEI programs in both the private and public sectors.\n\nTrump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all “equity-related” grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order that included a requirement that federal contractors and grantees certify that they don't “operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.”\n\nKennelly’s decision comes nearly two weeks after an appeals court lifted a broader nationwide injunction against Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders in a separate lawsuit in Baltimore. But Thursday’s ruling is limited in scope because Kennelly declined to extend the temporary restraining order to other federal agencies.\n\nChicago Women in Trades, which filed its case against the Trump administration last month, argued that the president's executive orders on DEI are so broad and vague that the organization had no way to ensure compliance, and thus they threaten its core mission.\n\nKennelly wrote that Chicago Women in Trades, which is being represented by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was likely to succeed in its arguments that parts of the executive orders are a violation of free speech rights and are unconstitutionally vague.\n\nAlthough the government argued that the certification provision “implicates only illegal DEI programs, it has studiously declined to shed any light on what this means. The answer is anything but obvious,” Kennelly wrote.\n\nKennelly wrote that he extended his order to all Labor Department contractors and grant recipients because the vagueness of Trump's executive orders, coupled with the threat of financial penalties, would likely pressure organizations to curb DEI programs in potential violation of free speech rights.\n\nRather than face potentially crippling penalties, “it is likely that many of these grantees will take the safer route and choose to simply stop speaking on anything remotely related to what the government might consider to promote DEI or equity. A nationwide restraining order is appropriate to protect grantees who cannot afford the risks inherent in biting the hand that feeds them,\" Kennelly wrote.\n\nThe judge also blocked the DOL from freezing or canceling any funding with Chicago Women in Trades, and the Trump administration from pursuing any False Claims Act enforcement against them.\n\nDuring a hearing on Tuesday, the Trump administration argued that Chicago Women in Trades' motion for relief was premature because its arguments rely on speculation as to how the executive orders will be implemented.\n\nBut Chicago Women in Trades noted in court filings that it has multiple communications from the Department of Labor directing them to ensure compliance with both DEI executive orders. The organization also said in court and has already lost a subcontract with a contractor trying to comply with the executive order.\n\nChicago Women in Trades has a long history of partnering with companies, state and federal agencies and other industry stakeholders to provide guidance and training on best practices for recruiting and retaining women in the trades — including training to combat bias and harassment that is prevalent in one of the country’s most male-dominated industries.\n\nIts grant work with the federal government dates back years, including two grants awarded under the first Trump administration under the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations, which aims to expand pathways for women seeking to enter skilled trades.\n\n________\n\nThe Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

Elise Stefanik to withdraw her nomination to be United Nations ambassador.\n\n\"With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat,\" the president added, referencing House Republicans' narrow five-seat margin in the chamber.\n\nStefanik gave up her position in House leadership after being nominated by Trump for the U.N. role. She was replaced as House Republican Conference Chair by Michigan Rep. Lisa McClain.\n\nIn a Fox News interview Thursday evening, her first since Trump's announcement, Stefanik said she's \"proud to be a team player\" given the slim Republican majority in the House.\n\n\"This is about stepping up as a team, and I am doing that as a leader, to ensure that we can take hold of this mandate and deliver these historic results,\" she said.\n\nStefanik said the decision to withdraw reached its \"culmination\" on Thursday and that she spoke with Trump multiple times.\n\nIn the interview, she acknowledged the razor-thin margin by which the GOP maintains control of the House. \"It's tough to count these votes every day, and we're going to continue to defy the political prognosticators and deliver victory on behalf of President Trump and, importantly, the voters across this country,\" she said.\n\nStefanik also pointed blame at Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who she suggested might have dragged her feet on holding a special election to replace her.\n\nEarlier Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he would invite Stefanik \"to return to the leadership table immediately\" and thanked her for her \"selfless decision\" to agree to withdraw her nomination. But a source familiar told ABC News that McClain does not plan to resign from her role. It's unclear what role, if any, Stefanik would hold in House Republican leadership as the top roles are currently filled. Leadership could create a new position for her, but nothing had been formally decided.\n\nIn the Fox News interview, Stefanik dodged answering a question regarding a possible return to a House leadership position, saying instead she is now able to \"speak out\" more since she is no longer pending a confirmation vote.\n\n\"The American people will be hearing a lot more from me,\" she said.\n\nRep.

Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People.\"\n\nHouse Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the House with 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats.

The position requires Senate confirmation.\n\nThe news came as Democrats and Republicans were preparing for the potential special election to replace her. A date for the special election in New York's 21st district, that would have chosen who would have replaced Rep.

(AP Photo/Brittainy Newman, File)\n\nTrevor Milton, the founder of electric vehicle start-up Nikola who was sentenced to prison last year, was pardoned by President Donald Trump late Thursday, the White House confirmed Friday.\n\nThe pardon of Milton, who was sentenced to four years in prison for exaggerating the potential of his technology, could wipe out hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution that prosecutors were seeking for defrauded investors.\n\nMilton and his wife donated more than $1.8 million to a Trump re-election campaign fund less than a month before the November election, according to the Federal Election Commission,\n\nAt Milton's trial, prosecutors say a company video of a prototype truck appearing to be driven down a desert highway was actually a video of a nonfunctioning Nikola that had been rolled down a hill.\n\nMilton had not been incarcerated pending an appeal.\n\nMilton said late Thursday on social media and via a press release that he had been pardoned by Trump.\n\n\"I am incredibly grateful to President Trump for his courage in standing up for what is right and for granting me this sacred pardon of innocence,” Milton said.\n\nThe White House confirmed the pardon Friday, though there was no notice of a pardon on the White House website.\n\nNikola, which was a hot start-up and rising star on Wall Street before becoming enmeshed in Milton's scandal, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February. That filing came months after the company said it would likely run out of cash early this year.\n\nMilton was convicted of fraud, portrayed by prosecutors as a con man six years after he had founded the company in a basement in Utah.\n\nProsecutors said Milton falsely claimed to have built its own revolutionary truck that was actually a General Motors product with Nikola’s logo stamped onto it.\n\nCalled as a government witness, Nikola’s CEO testified that Milton “was prone to exaggeration” when pitching his venture to investors.\n\nMilton resigned in 2020 amid reports of fraud that sent Nikola’s stock prices into a tailspin. Investors suffered heavy losses as reports questioned Milton’s claims that the company had already produced zero-emission 18-wheel trucks.\n\nThe company paid $125 million in 2021 to settle a civil case against it by the SEC. Nikola didn’t admit any wrongdoing.",

Randy Fine, can keep the seat in Republican hands.\n\nFine has lagged behind his Democratic opponent, Josh Weil, in fundraising, and Republicans have expressed concerns about his campaign, although many still believe he will be able to hold the seat in the ruby-red district.\n\nThe special election in Florida's 6th Congressional District, which is on the state's eastern coast and includes the city of Daytona Beach, is being held on Tuesday, April 1, to fill the vacancy created by former Rep. Mike Waltz when he resigned to become Trump's national security adviser.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, March 26, 2025.

Elise Stefanik to withdraw her nomination to be United Nations ambassador, citing \"a very tight Majority\" in the U.S. House.\n\nHouse Republicans currently hold a narrow majority with 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. Speaker Mike Johnson has a two-vote cushion for his majority.\n\nFine, at the start of the telephone rally for him, emphatically praised Trump and said he would serve in Congress as one of the president's strongest allies.\n\nFlorida State Rep.

I believe that God saved your life in Butler, Pennsylvania, so that you could save the world,\" Fine said, referencing the July assassination attempt Trump survived. \"And it will be one of the most profound honors of my life to be one of your foot soldiers as you make America great again.\"\n\nTrump praised Fine's early endorsement of him during the 2024 election cycle, adding, \"that's why Randy will always have a very open door to the Oval Office. He will be there whenever I need him, and he wants to be there whenever we need him. He wants to be there for you.\"\n\n\"I've gotten to know him under pressure situations, and he can react well under pressure. So go vote for Randy,\" Trump said later.\n\nFine reiterated he would work to carry out Trump's agenda in Congress.\n\n\"It's not overstating things to say that your agenda is at stake in this election, and this district can't let you down. Your agenda is on the ballot on April 1,\" he said.\n\nDuring the earlier telephone rally supporting the Republican candidate in the 1st Congressional District, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, Trump praised Patronis' work in Florida and framed the special election as important for his own agenda.\n\nThat special election, which will determine who takes the seat vacated by now-former Rep. Matt Gaetz, has gotten less concern from Republicans.\n\nFlorida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis speaks during a meeting between Gov.

So it's going to be the fool for the Democrat candidate, who happens to be terrible,\" Trump said of Patronis' Democratic opponent Gay Valimont, a gun violence prevention activist.\n\nPraising Patronis, Trump said, \"Jimmy's done an outstanding job as the chief financial officer of the state of Florida, helping to guide your state to tremendous economic success. And now he wants to keep on fighting for Florida in Congress.\"\n\nPatronis, speaking after Trump, told listeners, \"Look, if you're not fired up to hearing the president right now, then you need to get your pulse checked with President Trump and the White House.

Bush near the height of the War on Terror -- said he is unable to condone a \"unsupported, dramatic and facially unfair exclusionary policy.\"\n\n\"The government falls well short of its burden to show that banning transgender service is substantially related to achieving unit cohesion, good order, or discipline. Although the Court gives deference to military decision making, it would be an abdication to ignore the government's flat failure to address plaintiffs' uncontroverted evidence that years of open transgender service promoted these objectives,\" he wrote.\n\nThe group of seven active-duty service members who brought the lawsuit argued that the policy \"purposefully discriminates\" against soldiers based on their gender identity -- an argument that Justice Department lawyers attempted to rebut by reframing the question as a medical issue, impacting only people who suffer gender dysphoria. Judge Settle was unconvinced, writing that the policy \"uses gender dysphoria as a proxy to ban all transgender service members.\"\n\nThe Pentagon is seen from the air in Washington, Mar. 3, 2022. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\n\"The government's arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,\" he wrote, finding that each of the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed by the policy, which would curtail their military service.\n\nJudge Settle also called out the Trump administration for seemingly disregarding the service history of the transgender soldiers who brought the case, such as the Commander Emily Shilling, a naval aviator with 19 years of service who flew 60 combat missions before becoming a Navy test pilot.\n\n\"There is no claim and no evidence that she is now, or ever was, a detriment to her unit's cohesion, or to the military's lethality or readiness, or that she is mentally or physically unable to continue her service,\" Settle wrote.\n\n\"There is no claim and no evidence that Shilling herself is dishonest or selfish, or that she lacks humility or integrity. Yet absent an injunction, she will be promptly discharged solely because she is transgender,\" wrote the judge.",

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain -- Brazilian soccer player Dani Alves won his appeal against a sexual assault conviction as a Spanish court overturned the ruling Friday in a case that lasted more than three years and saw the former Barcelona defender spend 14 months in jail.\n\nAlves was found guilty in February 2024 of raping a woman in a nightclub in December 2022 and sentenced to four years, six months in prison. Alves denied wrongdoing during the three-day trial.\n\nThat court ruled Friday that there was “insufficient evidence” to rule out Alves' presumption of innocence.\n\n“Dani Alves is innocent, and that has been proven,” his defense lawyer Inés Guardiola told Catalan radio RAC1. “Justice has finally been served.”\n\nThe plaintiff's lawyer did not immediately respond to The Associated Press when emailed and messaged asking for comment.\n\nThe Alves trial was the first high-profile case since Spain overhauled its laws in 2022 to make consent central to defining a sex crime in response to an upswell of protests after a gang-rape case during the San Fermin bull-running festival in Pamplona in 2016.\n\nThe legislation popularly known as the “only yes means yes” law defines consent as an explicit expression of a person’s will, making it clear that silence or passivity do not equal consent.\n\nBut the four judges of a Barcelona-based appeals court ruled unanimously to overturn the conviction after reviewing the evidence and testimonies given to the lower court. In their ruling, they wrote that the testimony of the plaintiff “differed notably” from evidence of video footage taken before the woman and Alves entered the bathroom where she said he forced her to have sex without her consent.\n\nBefore last year's trial, the alleged victim told state prosecutors that she had danced with Alves at the nightclub and willingly entered the bathroom, but that later when she wanted to leave he would not let her. She said he slapped her, insulted her and forced her to have sex against her will.\n\nAlves denied those accusations at the three-day trial.\n\n“She never told me to stop. We were both enjoying ourselves,” Alves said, while repeating that the woman never asked to leave or made any indication that she did not want to have sex with him. He also denied having slapped or insulted her.\n\nAlves, now 41, was kept in jail from Jan. 20, 2023 until March 2024 until he was released after paying 1 million euros (then $1.2 million) for bail while awaiting his appeal. He also handed over his passports, with prosecutors having argued against releasing him on bail because of a possible flight risk.\n\nProsecutors wanted his prison sentence increased to nine years while the victim’s lawyer wanted him to stay behind bars for 12 years.\n\nThis decision could be appealed to the Spanish supreme court in Madrid.\n\nAlves was one of the most successful players of his generation and won dozens of titles with elite clubs including Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain. He also helped Brazil win two Copa Americas and an Olympic gold medal at age 38. He played at his third World Cup, the only major title he hasn’t won, in 2022. He played for Barcelona from 2008-16, helping the team win three Champions Leagues and six Spanish leagues, and briefly rejoined the club in 2022. He still has a residence near the city.\n\nHe was with Mexican club Pumas when he was arrested. Pumas terminated his contract immediately.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

(South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- A second South Carolina death row inmate has asked to die by firing squad just five weeks after the state carried out its first death by bullets.\n\nMikal Mahdi chose the firing squad Friday. His execution is scheduled for April 11.\n\nMahdi was convicted for killing a police officer with a gun he stole from the officer’s shed in 2004.\n\nMahdi had the choice of dying by firing squad, lethal injection or the electric chair. Mahdi is the first inmate to be executed in the state since Brad Sigmon chose to die by bullets on March 7. A doctor pronounced Sigmon dead less than three minutes after the shots were fired.\n\nMahdi, 41, ambushed Orangeburg public safety officer James Myers at his Calhoun County shed in July 2004 as he returned from an out-of-town birthday celebration for his wife, sister and daughter, prosecutors said.\n\nMyers’ wife found his burned body, shot at least eight times including twice in the head, in the shed that had been the backdrop for their wedding less than 15 months earlier, authorities said.\n\nMahdi will be strapped in a chair 15 feet (4.6 meters) from three prison employees who volunteered to be on the firing squad. A target will be placed on his chest. Their rifles will all be loaded with a live round that shatters when it hits his rib cage.\n\nAlong with Sigmon, only three other inmates — all in Utah — have been killed by a firing squad in the past 50 years. Sigmon was the first inmate killed by bullets in the U.S. since 2010.",

So, we'll, I think, we'll go as far as we have to go,\" President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nVance has touted Greenland’s \"incredible natural resources\" in speeches that call for the territory's acquisition for its riches in gold, copper and rare earth materials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announces tariffs on auto imports in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Mar. 26, 2025. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump's ambitions aren't far-fetched, according to an international relations expert who told ABC News that there are some avenues in which the U.S. could realistically acquire the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nHowever, international policy, laws and decades-long economic and political partnerships make Trump's wishes extremely improbable, according to Phillip Lipscy, professor of political science at the University of Toronto.\n\n\"This kind of rhetoric hasn't been part of U.S. foreign policymaking since World War II,\" he told ABC News. \"If the United States moves forward with this, this would be a game changer.\"\n\nLipscy noted that while acquiring Greenland would bolster the U.S.'s security in the Arctic Circle, such a move is not needed because of NATO nations' strong military and naval presence.\n\nAnnexation is not new in U.S. history, going back to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, when the U.S acquired a major portion of what is now the central part of the country was acquired in a deal with France.\n\nThe last time that the U.S. was given land that became territories was when it acquired three Pacific Ocean island groups as part of the post-World War II agreement with the United Nations in 1947 known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.\n\nThat deal took years of negotiating and an agreement from several nations who worked out the geopolitical landscape of post-war Oceania.\n\nOnly one of those island groups, the Marianas Islands, remains a U.S. territory.\n\nLipscy said such deals between sovereign nations have dwindled over the decades in exchange for agreements such as limited military partnerships, trade deals and other treaties, which take far less time and help keep the sovereignty of nations.\n\nVice President JD Vance stands with his wife Usha Vance as they take part in a tour of the Dachau Concentration Camp memorial site in Dachau, southern Germany, oFeb. 13, 2025. Tobias Schwarz/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump and the U.S. would have to negotiate with Denmark's government for a sale or an annexation of Greenland if he were to take over the land without violating international law or using the military to take the country by force.\n\nGreenland's politics are already making any such negotiation difficult, according to Lipscy.\n\nGreenland is a self-sovereign territory of Denmark with its own elected government, with Denmark's parliament handling international matters.\n\nThere has been a movement within the island to be independent from Denmark that will be a key factor in any future plans of a U.S. acquisition, according to Lipscy.\n\n\"Certainly, there may be a diplomatic solution that starts with an independent Greenland…but it's difficult to see that situation,\" he said.\n\nIn elections earlier this month, pro-independence parties won the most seats in parliament but neither want to be part of the U.S. Greenland is now forming a coalition government in the wake of the election.\n\nGreenland's government and its residents have loudly protested Trump since he began talking about acquiring it in December. He floated the idea earlier in his first term in 2019 but didn't pursue it.\n\n\"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders. We are not Americans, we are not Danes because we are Greenlanders. This is what the Americans and their leaders need to understand. We cannot be bought and we cannot be ignored,\" Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede said in a Facebook post earlier this month.\n\nGreenlandic Prime Minister, chairman of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party Mute Bourup Egede arrives at the polling station during the parliamentary election at the Godthaabshallen sports hall, in Nuuk, Greenland, Mar. 11, 2025. EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nEgede also called Friday's visit by the Vances and other U.S. officials, including national security adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, part of a \"very aggressive American pressure against the Greenlandic community\" and called for the international community to rebuke it.\n\nThe Danish government has also pushed back hard on Trump's calls to acquire Greenland and has encouraged its residents to speak out against it.\n\n\"They know well that Greenland isn't for sale. They know well that Greenland doesn't want to be a part of the United States,\" Danish Prime Mette Frederiksen said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"The attention is overwhelming and the pressure is great. But it's in times like these that you show what fabric you're made of. You haven't let yourselves be cowed. You have stood up for who you are - and you have shown what you stand for. It has my deepest respect,\" she added.\n\nFrederiksen said that other European nations are also on Denmark's side in this back-and-forth with Trump, already hampering the ties between the U.S. and its allies since Trump regained office.\n\nLipscy said that such a purchase would take a long time and would likely stretch long beyond Trump's term, especially if the Greenland and Danish leadership and their people continue to reject Trump's calls.\n\nIf Trump continued to ignore the wishes of Greenland and Denmark, it would also strain those relationships and affect economic, national security and political alliances that have been in place since the end of World War II, Lipscy said.\n\nPeople take part in a march ending in front of the US consulate, under the slogan, Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people, in Nuuk, Greenland, Mar. 15, 2025. Christian Klindt Soelbeck/Ritzau Scanpix via AP\n\n\"It would signal the U.S. can no longer be trusted to be a reliable partner and hold international norms,\" he said. \"No one would want to do any type of deal, partnership or negotiation.\"\n\nTrump has refused to rule out military action to take over Greenland, but Lipscy said that a full-on military acquisition would also not sit well in the domestic and international political field and, most importantly, among the American people.\n\nA poll released by the Wall Street Journal days before Trump returned to the White House found that 68% of Americans opposed the idea.\n\n\"The idea of territorial expansion is coming predominantly from the president himself and there isn't any widespread agreement on acquiring from the public or the Republican Party,\" Lipscy said.\n\nProtesters hold a banner reading \"Yankee Go Home\" during a march to the U.S. consulate during a demonstration, under the slogan 'Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people', in Nuuk, Greenland, Mar. 15, 2025. Christian Klindt Soelbeck/Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHe predicted that while Trump may be \"banging the table\" more to make his goal a reality, it won’t move the needle beyond his base because the general public knows that such a move would be costly and ultimately not help national security.\n\n\"I think even if the ultimate goal of the U.S. government is to secure closer ties with Greenland, the way the administration is going about with its policymaking is deeply counterproductive and unlikely to get the result they are seeking,\" he said.",

Spencer Cox speaks at the PBS Utah Governor's Monthly News Conference at the Eccles Broadcast Center in Salt Lake City.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill this week making the state the first in the nation to ban fluoride in public drinking water.\n\nUnder the bill, a person \"may not add fluoride to water in, or water that will be introduced into a public water system\" and a \"political subdivision may not enact or enforce an ordinance that requires or permits the addition of fluoride to water in, or water that will be introduced into, a public water.\"\n\nThe bill does allow pharmacists in the state to prescribe fluoride supplements and directs the Division of Professional Licensing to establish guidelines for those prescriptions.\n\nCox had previously indicated that he would sign the bill. The law is set to go into effect on May 7.\n\nFluoride is a mineral that naturally occurs in water sources such as lakes and rivers, and is even naturally present in some foods and beverages, according to the American Dental Association (ADA).\n\nIt is added to some dental products, such as toothpaste, to help prevent cavities.\n\nIn this Oct. 19, 2023, file photo, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox speaks at the PBS Utah Governor's Monthly News Conference at the Eccles Broadcast Center in Salt Lake City. Laura Seitz/The Deseret News via AP, Pool, FILE\n\nHigh-quality studies show fluoride prevents cavities and repairs damage to teeth caused by bacteria in the mouth. Fluoride makes tooth enamel stronger and rebuild weakened tooth enamel, the ADA says.\n\nFluoride also replaces minerals lost from teeth due to acid breakdown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHowever, influential skeptics such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have long raised doubts about the benefits of fluoride.\n\nIn an interview with NPR in November 2024, Kennedy doubled down on his promise of persuading local governments to remove fluoride from their water supplies.\n\nHe has claimed that fluoride in drinking water affects children's neurological development and that other countries that have removed fluoride from their water supplies have not seen an increase in cavities.\n\nSome health professionals have expressed concerns about excessive fluoride intake and potential toxicity.\n\nMany doctors and dental associations, however, argue that fluoride in water is still a crucial, low-risk/high-reward public health tool, especially for disadvantaged children and adults who may not be able to practice regular dental hygiene.\n\nIn a letter asking Cox to veto the bill, the ADA said that Utah health department data shows communities with fluoridated water had decreasing rates of dental disease.\n\nThe association calls community water fluoridation \"the single most effective public health measure to prevent tooth decay.\"\n\n\"Studies prove water fluoridation continues to be effective in reducing dental decay by at least 25% in children and adults, even in the of era widespread availability of fluoride from other sources, such as fluoride toothpaste,\" the ADA states on its website. \"So, by simply drinking fluoridated water, you are doing something good for your oral health.\"\n\nABC News' Sony Salzman contributed to this report.",

At least 41 people have been hospitalized so far.\n\nChildren and teenagers between ages 5 and 17 make up the majority of cases at 164, followed by children ages 4 and under comprising 131 cases, according to the data.\n\nIt comes as the CDC has so far confirmed 483 measles cases this year in at least 19 states: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington\n\nThis is likely an undercount due to delays in states reporting cases to the federal health agency.\n\nMeanwhile, reports have emerged that some unvaccinated children hospitalized with measles in Texas are showing signs of vitamin A toxicity.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other vaccine skeptics have promoted vitamin A amid the measles outbreak. During an interview on Fox News with Sean Hannity earlier this month, Kennedy said that HHS was currently providing vitamin A to measles patients for treatment, claiming vitamin A can \"dramatically\" reduce measles deaths.\n\nA member of the medical staff administers a dose of the measles vaccine to a child at a health center in Lubbock, Texas, on Feb. 27, 2025. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nVitamin A can be used as part of supportive treatment for those who are already sick, with the World Health Organization recommending two doses of vitamin A in children and adults with measles to restore low vitamin A levels, which can help prevent eye damage and blindness.\n\nHowever, vitamin A does not prevent measles infections, experts previously told ABC News, nor does it directly fight the virus when used as a treatment.\n\nCovenant Children's Hospital, which has treated dozens of measles patients in Texas amid the outbreak, told ABC News in a statement that some parents appear to have given their unvaccinated children vitamin A for \"treatment and prevention.\" Some of those children now show signs of vitamin A toxicity.\n\nFewer than 10 children have come in with abnormal liver function in routine lab tests, indicating possible vitamin A toxicity, according to Covenant Children's.\n\nVitamin A toxicity occurs when someone consumes too much vitamin A, and can result in severe complications iincluding liver and kidney damage.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles.\n\nThe CDC currently recommends that people receive two vaccine doses, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.\n\nState health data shows that Gaines County, which is the epicenter of the Texas outbreak, has seen its number of vaccine exemptions grow dramatically in the last dozen years.\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. listens as President Donald Trump holds a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, on February 26, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn 2013, roughly 7.5% of kindergartners in the county had parents or guardians who filed for an exemption for at least one vaccine. Ten years later, that number rose to more than 17.5% -- one of the highest in all of Texas, according to state health data.\n\nAmong the nationally confirmed cases by the CDC, about 95%, are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, the agency said.\n\nOf those cases, 3% are among those who received just one dose of the MMR inoculation and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC.\n\nABC News' Will McDuffie contributed to this report.",

Authorities failed to turn the flights around, saying they were already in international waters.\n\nAn official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subsequently acknowledged in a sworn declaration that \"many\" of the alleged gang members did not have criminal records in the United States -- but said that \"the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose\" and \"demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.\"",

I’ve literally had a front-row seat to the wonders of nature, young and old, big and small. Every day, I’m thrilled and amazed by who stares into my camera lens, especially when they’re newly minted.\n\nI’ve also learned that cuteness has zero to do with the mechanics of survival in the wild. While the tapir exhibited one strategy for hiding, there are myriad ways to overcome the vulnerability of youth. As I see it, if you’re a youngster in this dog-eat-dog world, you have three main methods to make it: You can blend in, take off, or let your parents defend you.\n\nHiding makes a lot of sense for many animals. Shorebirds often scrape a simple depression in gravel or sand, then lay eggs that blend right in. Once hatched, their chicks are nearly as speckled and are camouflaged too. You literally can have a nest between your feet and miss it. Aquatic invertebrates can vanish under rocks on the floor of a streambed. Young geckos blend perfectly into the moss on a tree.\n\nRunning off is another option. Ungulates like wildebeests and zebras go from newborn to walking in minutes. Precocial birds from ostriches to prairie chickens hatch, dry, and are ready to follow Mom soon after. She’ll teach them what to eat, how to shelter from storms, and how to escape from the bad guys.",

        "content": "The river flows vast and soundless. It’s December in southern Kazakhstan, and the landscape near the Syr Darya River is smudged in shades of brown and taupe—dormant grasses, silted floodplains, leafless trees. This is not the most picturesque stretch of riverbank, strewn as it is with food wrappers, bottles, a decomposing sedan. Overhead, the sun is obscured by a haze of coal- and woodsmoke. But when it comes to what Bernie Kuhajda is searching for, the spot feels perfect.\n\n“This is the habitat we need,” says Kuhajda, an aquatic conservation biologist with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute. He’s hoping to find a species of sturgeon—the Syr Darya—that’s native to these waters but hasn’t been seen since the 1960s, after a series of Soviet dams was built throughout the river system. Those projects blocked access to the fish’s spawning grounds and forever changed the flow of the Syr Darya, which drains from the high peaks of Kyrgyzstan into what is now the remnants of the Aral Sea. If the sturgeon somehow still exists, Kuhajda thinks this silty, shallow expanse of river is where it can be found.\n\n(Critically endangered sturgeons threatened by proposed dams in Caucasus.)\n\nSome months earlier, Kuhajda had been contacted by the conservation organization Re:Wild, which administers a program to search for what it calls lost species—creatures that haven’t been seen for at least a decade and could be extinct, but there’s not enough data to be conclusive. The officials at Re:Wild reached out to Kuhajda knowing that he was one of a very small collection of scientists who have ever laid eyes on the Syr Darya sturgeon. As a graduate student in the 1990s, he visited museums in London, Moscow, and St. Petersburg and videotaped 27 spindled specimens, bleached white from years of storage. “They said, ‘You’re the expert,’ ” Kuhajda says, remembering the call with Re:Wild. “And I said, ‘Well, I’ve seen them dead in a jar.’ ”",

The planet will reach its greatest western elongation, one of the two points in its orbit where it is farthest from the sun.\n\nSince Mercury orbits so close to the sun, it’s often drowned out by sunlight—and that’s why the planet is best viewed during its greatest elongation. Be careful not to look into the sun when observing Mercury, especially through binoculars or a telescope.\n\nLyrid meteor shower—April 21–22\n\nThe Lyrid meteor shower is expected to peak between April 21 and 22, allowing one to spot up to 18 meteors per hour under ideal conditions. The shower runs from April 17 to 26, but this two-night window is the best time to catch the show. The moon might drown out some dimmer meteors, as it’ll be 40 percent full.\n\n(Here’s ow to see the Lyrid meteor shower at its peak.)\n\nThe Lyrids are named for the constellation Lyra, from which the meteors appear to emanate, but their parent object is the comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher.

See full disclaimer below.*\n\nYour smart phone’s flashlight may work well for finding a cat toy underneath the sofa. But for navigating through the woods on a moonless night, your best bet is a good headlamp.\n\nAs a longtime journalist and outdoorsman, I keep a headlamp in my multiday backpacking bag, the fanny pack I use on short day hikes, and the work backpack that goes with me around the country. You never know when you may need one.\n\nOf course, not all headlamps are built or designed the same. The best headlamp depends on many factors: Brightness, versatility, durability, and battery. Ultimately, the best headlamp for you depends on your preferences and how you plan to use it.\n\nTo help you narrow down your list, I spent weeks testing multiple headlamps, scouring online reviews, and even asking a few outdoorsy friends for their opinions. With its array of features, including voice activation and super bright light, the Coast RL35R impressed me the most. It’s a great overall headlamp for most travelers. But I also zeroed in on a few other terrific options for different needs, including the best headlamp for runners and one that offers great value for the money.\n\nThe best headlamp options\n\nSo what makes a good headlamp? First and foremost, brightness. Look for headlamps with multiple brightness modes. Cleaning up the campsite before crawling into your sleeping bag requires less light than hiking an unfamiliar trail on a moonless night. When you’re on the trail, you need a headlamp bright enough to illuminate obstacles in your path.\n\nThose brightness modes impact battery life. The longer the battery life, the better. Keeping a headlamp on high will drain the battery faster than if it’s on low or medium.\n\nFinally, the best headlamps are durable. After all, a headlamp will likely be part of your travel gear. If you accidentally drop it on a rock, for example, will it still work? We took these factors and more into consideration when compiling this list.\n\nBest headlamp overall: Coast RL35R\n\nWhy we like it: After testing dozens of headlamps from multiple manufacturers, the Coast RL35R is hands down my favorite. It has the most features and one of the brightest lamps. You can combine multiple light modes to produce more than 1,100 lumens for two-and-a-half hours. If you prefer to use it on the lowest setting, it will run up to 83 hours.\n\nAt first, I thought the voice activation was gimmicky. However, I realized this feature is ideal in lots of situations, including in cold weather when you can’t take off bulky gloves or when you’re working with your hands while camping.\n\nIf this one doesn’t work for you, the Coast FL20R and the Fenix WH23R are solid contenders. Both offer great features and crisp, bright lighting. But in the end, the Coast RL35R was a class above.\n\nKeep in mind: As much as I love the RL35R’s voice activation, I think many users will use it once or twice before forgetting the commands (there are many). The number of light options seems a bit much. This headlamp is bulkier and heavier than many other headlamps I tested.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 1,100 | Modes: Flood, spotlight, arc, high, medium, low, red, green, blue | Battery: Rechargeable USB-C\n\nBest rechargeable headlamp: Petzl Swift RL\n\nPhotograph courtesy REI Petzl Swift RL Buy it now at REI\n\nWhy we like it: The Petzl Swift RL offers lots of features in a compact and lightweight headlamp. The proprietary reactive lighting claims to adjust the light output automatically, although I’m a bit skeptical about how well that feature really works.\n\nI like the automatic indicator displaying the charge level. The light swivel is one of the best I tested and the strap design holds it in place better than similar models. (Reddit’s ultrarunning community agrees and praises the headlamp’s ability to perform in inclement weather.)\n\nKeep in mind: The Swift RL could be more intuitive out of the box. The $130 price tag is steep, especially when there are plenty of perfectly fine options that are more affordable. This headlamp can feel a bit heavy after a few hours.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 1,100 | Modes: Standard light (high, medium, low), reactive light (high, medium, low), red light, red strobe | Battery: Rechargeable USB-C\n\n( Camping for the first time? Here’s a handy dandy gear checklist .)\n\nBest LED headlamp: Petzl Iko Core\n\nPhotograph courtesy Backcountry Petzl Iko Core Buy it now at Backcountry\n\nWhy we like it: I was very impressed by the quality of light coming from this flyweight (2.4-ounce) headlamp. The 500-lumen light seems brighter than some headlamps I tested claiming 1,000 lumens or more. I like that you can swap out the standard 1,250-millilamp-hour battery for three common AAA batteries, if needed. It’s comfortable on, with even weight distribution. You can also fold the headlamp into the semi-translucent storage pouch for a makeshift tent lantern.\n\nKeep in mind: With multiple parts, I found the band construction to be overly complicated. It doesn’t fit well over a baseball cap, which multiple reviewers have flagged as well. Other reviewers say the construction, particularly where the light meets the strap body, failed to hold up in the long run. (The headlamp comes with a five-year warranty). If you’re using three AAA batteries, the Iko Core’s max lumens drop from 500 to 350, which is still enough to find your way, but we’d prefer longer run times.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 500 | Modes: Low, medium, high | Battery: Rechargeable USB-C or 3 AAA\n\nBest running headlamp: Petzl Iko Core\n\nPhotograph courtesy Backcountry Petzl Iko Core Buy it now at Backcountry\n\nWhy we like it: The same bright light that makes this a top choice for an LED headlamp (see above) also makes it ideal for nighttime runners. It’s also one of the lightest and most comfortable headlamps we tested. The snug plastic and rubber strap keeps everything in its proper place, even on rough terrain.\n\nPetzl claims the light will last for nine hours on the 100-lumen setting and two-and-a-half at 500 lumens. If the rechargeable battery dies on the trail, you can swap it out for three AAA batteries. This headlamp is water resistant too—a thoughtful detail if it suddenly starts to rain while you’re pounding the pavement.\n\nKeep in mind: The Iko Core has three modes (low, medium, high) but no red light. Reviewers note that the construction, particularly where the light meets the strap body, failed to hold up in the long run. However, this headlamp comes with a five-year warranty.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 500 | Modes: Low, medium, high | Battery: Rechargeable or 3 AAA\n\n( Nat Geo staff members swear by this camping essentials )\n\nBrightest headlamp: Coast WPH34R\n\nWhy we like it: At full strength, this 2,000-lumen headlamp can shine nearly 200 yards, significantly farther than most of the headlamps we tested.\n\nIt’s also one of the most sturdily built headlamps we tested. The aluminum WPH34R is waterproof up to five meters and resists impact up to one meter, per Coast. It’s easy to operate with intuitive functions. The charging port is hidden underneath a knob instead of a rubber gasket, which makes it dustproof in addition to waterproof. The so-called “ultra strap” breathes well, with a silicone interior band to help keep it in place on your forehead.\n\nKeep in mind: The WPH34R is the heaviest headlamp we tested. We found the battery port a bit difficult to locate. The battery life could be better; it takes a long time to recharge. You need a proprietary rechargeable battery.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 2,000 | Modes: Flood, spotlight, flood/spot, red, green | Battery: Rechargeable\n\nBest hiking headlamp: Petzl Swift RL\n\nPhotograph courtesy REI Petzl Swift RL Buy it now at REI\n\nWhy we like it: The Swift RL may only be 100 grams, but it shines brighter than many significantly heavier headlamps we tested and illuminated more of the trail during a nighttime hike.\n\nThe strap is designed to hug the curve of your skull, meaning this headlamp will stay in place while you’re moving around. The headlamp swivels up and down to illuminate any potential hazards in your path. We also appreciate that the Swift RL comes with a pouch that works as a light for your tent.\n\nKeep in mind: The rechargeable battery doesn’t interchange with AAAs, so unless you have a backup battery (which retails for $60), you may be out of luck.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 1,100 | Modes: Standard (high, medium, low); reactive (high, medium, low), red light, red strobe | Battery: Rechargeable USB-C\n\n( These are the best hiking boots for women )\n\nBest waterproof headlamp: Fenix HM50R v2.0\n\nWhy we like it: While most headlamps are classified weather- or water-resistant, Fenix’s flagship headlamp is waterproof to a depth of one-and-a-half meters in fresh water for up to 30 minutes, according to the brand.\n\nThe solid aluminum light’s strong too. The anodized finish resists abuse and impact up to six-and-a-half feet, according to the company, in addition to resisting dust.\n\nThe 700-lumen light detaches from the strap base so you can use it as a flashlight. On turbo level, it shines farther than 375 feet. It takes an hour at the highest level to deplete the battery and about 90 minutes to fully recharge.\n\nAt 2.7 ounces, it’s lightweight enough to wear for hours without straining your neck. Reviewers praise this headlamp’s ultra-comfortable headband and features. We also appreciate that Fenix offers a limited lifetime warranty.\n\nKeep in mind: I’m not sold on the battery life. I fully charged the light, played around with it off and on over a couple nights, then left it alone for a week. When I turned it back on, the battery indicator shined red, which meant there was less than half a charge left. I expected a bit more resiliency.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 600 | Modes: Turbo, high, medium, low, red, red flashing | Battery: Rechargeable USB-C\n\n( We love these waterproof backpacks )\n\nBest headlamp with red light: Biolite 800 Pro\n\nPhotograph courtesy BioLite Biolite 800 Pro Buy it now at BioLite\n\nWhy we like it: Red light is important to protect your night vision (and that of those around you). As an aspiring astrophotographer, I use the red light on my headlamp often. The 800 Pro has the best quality red light of all the headlamps I tested. It also generates red light in both the front and back, where the battery pack is located. Additionally, the light lasts a long time, up to 150 hours on low and four hours on medium.\n\nAfter testing, I also feel the Coast RL35R deserves an honorable mention. It features a brilliant red light that’s almost too bright, at a lower price.\n\nKeep in mind: The 800 Pro can feel a bit awkward on the head, given the weight imbalance between the light and heavier battery pack. The strap doesn’t wick sweat as well as other headlamps. The promised 800 lumens come in a 30-second burst. You get 500 lumens at standard high. At $100, I think this headlamp is a bit pricey for what you get.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 800 | Modes: Spotlight, floodlight, spot/flood, red flood, white strobe, 30-second burst | Battery: USB-C Rechargeable\n\nBest headlamp for camping: Fenix WH23R\n\nWhy we like it: The WH23R headlamp is built for work applications, but it has several benefits for the campsite. While other headlamps I tested have push buttons, the WH23R has a simple side dial for choosing light modes. Pressing it lets you cycle through light intensities.\n\nWith 600 lumens, according to the brand, this headlamp shines bright enough for chopping wood or performing other tasks around camp. It lasts for nearly four hours on a single charge. At the highest setting, the beam illuminates about 109 yards out.\n\nWhile this headlamp has a simple, old-school feel, it incorporates one high-tech twist. Once you switch the dial to on, you can wave your hand above it to turn it off or back on. It’s also easy to check the power—with the light off, simply press the side dial. Four lights mean 75-100 percent charged, three means 50-75 percent, and so on.\n\nIf you want another option, the Petzl Tikka Core earns an honorable mention for camping. It’s a solid, no-frills headlamp that gets the job done, particularly when you’re staying close to your campsite.\n\nKeep in mind: The WH23R isn’t the sleekest or lightest headlamp on the market because it was designed to be worn with hard hats. It charges via a USB-C cord, with no option to switch out to a physical battery. There’s no red light.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 600 | Modes: Spotlight, flood, both, high, medium, low | Battery: USB-C charging port\n\nBest budget headlamp: Coast FL20R\n\nWhy we like it: The Coast FL20R is easy to use, water resistant, and powerful enough for most situations. It offers everything most travelers will need in a rechargeable headlamp for about $25. Despite the low cost, it comes with a lifetime guarantee.\n\nThe 520 maximum lumen light adjusts downward, providing up to 50 meters of light for nighttime walks. If you don’t need that much power or distance, the low 50-lumen setting will give you up to 25 hours of run time (versus more than six hours on medium and two and a half on high, according to the manufacturer).\n\nThis is one of the lightest headlamps I tested—you may even forget you have it on, especially if you’re wearing it over a hat.\n\nKeep in mind: If you run out of battery while in the field, the integrated USB-C charging means you can’t switch out batteries. The red and green lights are relatively dim compared to the bright main light.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 520 | Modes: Low, medium, high, red, green | Battery: Built-in USB-C port\n\n( These are the best hiking boots for men )\n\nBest headlamp to stash in a fanny pack: Petzl Bindi\n\nWhy we like it: I keep this “just in case” headlamp in my day-hike fanny pack. It provides that extra bit of comfort knowing I have a weather-resistant light in my bag, especially when I’m out in the late fall and winter. If I had the money, I’d stash a Bindi everywhere, from the glove compartment in my car to a drawer in my desk. I love that you can lock the Bindi so it won’t accidentally turn on, which can lead to battery drain.\n\nFor its compact size, the Bindi exhibits a ton of light (200 lumens). It’s so light and comfortable, that I wouldn’t mind wearing it all night. This could be a great option for ultra-light hikers looking for weight savings.\n\nIt’s easy to test the battery: simply press the button and check the secondary (red) light. If it’s green, it’s charged between 66-100 percent. Orange indicates a 33-66 percent charge, while red means it’s at less than 33 percent and should be recharged.\n\nKeep in mind: The Bindi is so small partly because there’s no removeable battery. If you run out of juice in the wilderness, you can’t just insert some fresh AAAs. Despite the Bindi’s size, I expected a longer run time than two hours on high and three hours on medium. For budget-conscious outdoor lovers, the $50 may seem steep given this headlamp’s bare-bones features.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 200 | Modes: High, medium, low, red | Battery: Built-in USB-C port\n\n(Here are 11 top-notch fanny packs for travelers)\n\nBest truly hands-free headlamp: Coast RL35R\n\nWhy we like it: The voice-activated RL35R is a great option for people who work with their hands or in the cold. Voice commands include setting the light to high, medium, or low, plus making adjustments in 20-percent increments, up or down.\n\nIf you prefer a warmer light, the arc setting has you covered. The red, green, and blue lights are bright, but not overpoweringly so. On its brightest setting, the 1,100-lumen RL35R is comparable to other headlamps with a higher lumen count. At its highest setting, this headlamp can last about two and a half hours, while the lowest setting lets it run for up to 83 hours.\n\nKeep in mind: To take full advantage of the RL35R’s capabilities, you need to remember 15 voice commands. If you’re used to an ultra-light headlamp, the weight of this headlamp may feel uncomfortable.\n\nProduct details: Lumens: 1,100 | Modes: Flood, spotlight, arc, high, medium, low, red, green, blue | Battery: Rechargeable USB-C\n\n( The beauty of car camping? Anyone can do it. Here’s what you need .)\n\nHow we chose the best headlamps\n\nI’ve used a wide variety of headlamps for many decades in the outdoors, learning what makes a headlamp great rather than merely good. Over the course of several weeks, a small group of outdoor lovers and I thoroughly tested each of the headlamps featured in this article.\n\nTo supplement my knowledge and opinions, I relied on the following:\n\n• Third-party reviews: When I felt that my expertise was lacking, I referred to expert sources online, including product reviews.\n\n• Brand reputation: I chose trusted brands that offer a generous warranty.\n\n• Feedback from other users: During the evaluation process, a few trusted friends, with varying outdoors experience levels, graciously offered their feedback and criticisms.\n\nTips for buying a headlamp\n\nLumens and watts\n\nLumens measure a headlamp’s brightness, while watts measure how much energy it uses. Cheaper options typically produce about 100-250 lumens, while higher-end models, including our pick, the Coast WPH34R , can produce 2,000 or more. Look for a headlamp producing at least 500 lumens if you plan to explore at night.\n\nWeight\n\nAlthough the heaviest headlamps we tested came in at under a pound, having that extra weight strapped to your head can be exhausting. If you plan to wear a headlamp for hours at a time, it may be best to get one that balances a decent amount of lumens with a manageable number of ounces. Our top picks, the Petzl Iko Core and the Fenix HM50R v2.0, produce plenty of lumens considering their light weight.\n\nBrightness\n\nEveryone wants the brightest light, but often the brightest lights have the shortest battery life. If you’re spending all your time at the campsite, a lower-powered (and lower-priced) option, such as our favorite Petzl Tikka Core , should be more than enough.\n\nType of uses\n\nWhat do you anticipate doing in the dark? If you’re into astrophotography, you need a headlamp with a good red light, such as the Biolite 800 Pro or Coast RL35R from our list. If you’re into running, you need a lightweight lamp, like the Fenix HM50R v2.0 or Petzl Iko Core, that shines far and bright enough to avoid potential dangers on the trail.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat are some headlamp maintenance tips?\n\nMost headlamps are weather resistant, not waterproof. If you’re caught in a sudden downpour or plunged into water, thoroughly dry your headlamp as soon as possible.\n\nIf the straps get dirty from sweat or dirt, detach it from the lamp and wash it in a sink or basin with dish soap. Rinse and fully dry before reattaching it.\n\nWhat are the highest lumens for headlamps?\n\nOf the headlamps we tested, the Coast WPH34R produces 2,000 lumens. Headlamps designed for industrial purposes produce even more. But those tend to be cost-prohibitive and not the best fit for recreational use. It’s not uncommon to find headlamps that produce between 1,000 and 2,000 lumens at a reasonable price, but the average outdoors fan may not need all that light.\n\nIs a battery-powered or rechargeable headlamp better?\n\nThat depends on personal preference. We prefer the hybrid model offered by several our contenders, including the Petzl Iko Core and Petzl Tikka Core . These let you exchange a rechargeable battery for either another battery or common AAAs, which is convenient if you find yourself running out of power in the woods.\n\nNational Geographic, Outside, AARP, and more.

        "title": "Synergy? Offlining? We all hate corporate jargon—but here’s why we still use it",
        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "For something designed to streamline communication, corporate jargon often does the opposite—leaving many employees confused, excluded, or just plain annoyed.\n\nA survey of more than 8,000 working professionals across eight countries found that 58 percent feel their fellow employees overuse jargon. If given the opportunity, nearly half of them would eliminate its usage since deciphering their meanings “causes stress and slows down productivity.”\n\nYet, we persist. Even fictional workplaces like Severance’s Lumon Industries parody the language of modern employment—with their Office Retreat Team Building Occurrences and waffle parties—because it’s all too recognizable. So, what keeps us looping in and syncing up? What does this evolving vocabulary actually do for us, and why does it endure?\n\nDrilling down on jargon\n\nLanguage isn’t just about sharing information; it’s social, says Daria Bahtina, a lecturer from the University of California Los Angeles’ linguistics department. “When we speak, we’re not only passing facts back and forth, we’re performing relationships, identities, affiliations, and stances,” she says. Corporate jargon is a natural by-product of people working together toward a shared goal—even if that goal is surviving a Monday morning meeting.\n\n(New words are spreading faster than ever—thanks to teenage girls.)\n\nThis isn’t limited to managers or corporate departments. Bahtina says specialized language pops up wherever people gather: in a team of software engineers, a hospital triage unit, or even a neighborhood book club after their third bottle of wine. Our lexicon of choice has always spoken to who we are and what we’re trying to make sense of as a collective. “Language follows behavior,” Bahtina says. “We change how we work, how we live, how we relate—and then, we create the words to talk about that change.”\n\nFor example, workplace jargon in the early 20th century 1910s maximized production, precision, and accuracy, essential values during rapid industrialization. By the 2010s, a different set of priorities emerged, shaped by the rise of fourth-wave feminism and social movements. Terms like terms like “DEI,” “unconscious bias,” and “inclusive leadership” entered the mainstream. Even today, TikTok-viral terms like ‘quiet quitting’ and ‘coffee badging’ popularized by a post-pandemic, hybrid workforce signal a culture still negotiating what work means—and who defines it.\n\nJargon doesn’t just connect—it also divides\n\nIf this lingo is meant to mirror our contexts and conversations, why are they so complicated? Doesn’t this defeat its original purpose? Far from it, actually—jargon is also a means of segregation. “Shared jargon can foster a sense of identity and community. Speaking the same language as everyone else is a way of saying, ‘I belong here,’” says Eric Anicich, associate professor of management and organization at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business.\n\nIn this sense, office jargon doesn’t just describe reality—Anicich says that “it reprograms it, dividing those who are ‘in’ from those who’ll never fully understand.”\n\nOrganizations often use jargon to hide sinister intentions or downplay the real effects of their actions. Anicich cites the 2008 financial crisis, where phrases like “synthetic CDOs” and “tranches of debt products” masked the true scale of the risks involved. In more recent times, mass layoffs are now shrouded in euphemisms like “downsizing,” “restructuring,” or “re-engineering.”\n\n(Why it’s never too late to learn a language as an adult.)\n\nJargon also serves a performative function. Together with Zachariah Brown and Adam Galinsky, Anicich conducted research that shows how office lingo is also used for impression management. According to their findings, lower-status individuals are likelier to use jargon in evaluative situations—not to clarify their message but to signal intelligence and competence.\n\n“In that sense, jargon is the linguistic equivalent of a luxury car: it may have legitimate functions, but it’s also a status symbol,” Anicich explains. “It’s funny until you realize how often real organizations use language to draw invisible lines between insiders and outsiders.”\n\nShould we put a hard stop?\n\nSo, where do we go from here? Should we strip work language down to the simplest possible terms? Not necessarily. “Jargon is used as a tool—it’s not inherently good nor bad, so it depends on how and when you use it,” Anicich says.\n\nIn fact, it’s nearly impossible to avoid. Jargon seeps into everyday life in ways we barely notice. Bahtina mentions how fans of Grey’s Anatomy who have never set foot in a hospital can still understand phrases like “code blue” or “intubate.” “This doesn’t mean that they can perform surgery, it shows how jargon can flow beyond its origin and become part of everyday speech,” she says. Perhaps it can even help us articulate feelings or phenomena that we didn’t know how to describe before.\n\n(How do you save a language from extinction?)\n\nInstead of resorting to extremes, experts agree that it’s best to interrogate whether jargon is being used constructively. Is the shared language fostering understanding or obscuring important information? Is it inviting people to contribute to the discussion or barring them from true belonging? Are employees more focused on reading between the lines than on the task at hand? If our vocabulary is building walls instead of bridges, it may be time to circle back—and rethink how we speak at work.",

        "title": "7 of the best places to wild camp in Europe",
        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nThere’s no denying wild camping takes a lot of work. The buy-in costs are steep, too, if you can’t borrow (or rent) your gear — tent, camping stove, water filter, sleeping bag, rucksack, waterproofs. But if you love the great outdoors, you’ll think it worth every penny when you pitch your tent and watch the sun set in the middle of nowhere. Your boots are off, dinner’s a-cooking and a sense of peace and serenity wraps itself around you like a blanket. There’s bound to be a sense of pride, too — and it’s never stronger than when, the following morning, you pack away your gear and clear up every last speck of rubbish. In a day’s time, once the grass has recovered, no one will know you’ve even been there.\n\nSounds tempting? Then here are seven of Europe’s best destinations where, provided you respect the rules, you can enjoy the thrill of wild camping.\n\n1. Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden\n\nWith more than 30,000 islands and skerries to choose from, you’re always close to somewhere where you can pitch a tent here — in sheltered bays, hidden away among trees or perched on one of the ubiquitous, waterside domes of rock. And with the Baltic Sea breezes blowing, mosquitos are almost never a problem.\n\nFor first-time explorers and those without their own gear, the area between Sollenkroka and Stavsnäs is the perfect playground. Both harbours are served by buses from Stockholm and are home to rental companies such as Nature Travels and Get Out, who can provide not just kayaks but complete sets of camping gear. All you need bring is your own food and a sense of adventure.\n\nBe mindful that wild camping is not permitted on every island in the Stockholm Archipelago. Some are too densely settled for that and the rule of thumb in Sweden is that you shouldn’t pitch your tent on working farmland or anywhere near a house.\n\n2. Nærøyfjord, Norway\n\nYou won’t find a more spectacular place to camp than this — on the shores of Norway’s narrowest fjord, with towering cliffs almost everywhere you look. Norway’s right to roam and its permissive camping rules suggest a landscape full of promise, too, though the sheer-sided topography does limit the number of good pitches. It’s best to invest in a detailed map and plan ahead. Take the train from Bergen to Voss, then a bus to Gudvangen and after that you have two choices. Either rent a canoe from Nordic Ventures and paddle your way to a pitch. Or take a ferry to Dyrdal and explore on foot from there. You might want to book into a proper campsite on your first night — such as Dyrdal Gard. That way you can take your time finding a wild pitch on day two.\n\nScotland's Isle of Rum offers ultimate solitude to wild campers. Photograph by Joerg Angeli, Getty Images\n\n3. Rum, Scotland\n\nHalf the fun of wild camping comes from the giddy sense of being off-grid, and in the UK there aren’t many spots more disconnected than the Isle of Rum. It’s a sizeable island in the Inner Hebrides which comes complete with its own challenging circuit of mountains to rival the Cuillins of Skye. It’s also car-free and 85 minutes by the quickest ferry from Mallaig.\n\nFew people pop over for a day trip. Instead, alongside a local population of 40 people, you’ll find 1,000 red deer, around 30% of the world’s population of Manx shearwater and two kinds of eagles. Scotland’s generous wild camping rules apply though you can only stay in one spot for two or three days before moving on. Sheltered Kinloch Bay may look tempting but is home to a large and hungry host of midges. So hike instead to the more exposed Kilmory Bay on the north coast — the view is straight across the water to Skye.\n\n(How to plan a wild camping adventure in Scotland.)\n\n4. Oulanka National Park, Finland\n\nThe thunderous cataracts and broad, ever-changing sandbanks of two rivers — the Oulankajoki and Kitkajoki — add an ever-present sense of drama to Finland’s Oulanka National Park. Straddling the Arctic Circle in eastern Finland, it’s a place of primeval forest, rare orchids and intact ecosystems that include bears, lynx and wolverines. But it’s also home to one of the country’s most popular hikes: the 50-mile Karhunkierros. Aim for late August or September (when the mosquitoes have gone), fly into Kuusamo airport and travel onwards by bus to the central Oulanka Visitor Centre, changing at Käylä. You’ll find Finland’s right to roam (and to camp) is tempered by local regulations. But pitching your tent close to official rest areas and wilderness cabins seems a small price to pay for access to such a big, green and biodiverse space.\n\nLatvia's vast network of state forests and rural beaches are the only sites where wild camping is allowed. Photograph by Victoria Vitkovska, Getty Images\n\n5. Cape Kolka, Latvia\n\nLatvia’s wild camping rules are some of the tightest in the Nordics and Baltics — it’s not allowed in national parks and nature reserves, and you can be moved on if you camp on private land, too. However, you can go wild camping in the country’s vast network of state forests as well as on its rural beaches (provided you avoid sand dunes). So it’s no wonder the forested shores that lead towards Cape Kolka are so popular with Latvians in the summer. Lying 75 miles northwest of the capital — on the Baltic Coastal Hiking Route — this long, sandy spit of land is where the Gulf of Riga meets the Baltic Sea. Depending on which shore you pitch your tent, it’s a place of magnificent sunrises and sunsets, too.\n\n6. Lake District, England\n\nWild camping is not permitted in the Lake District without the relevant landowner’s permission. But there is, nevertheless, a long tradition of pitching your tent quietly for a night amid the high fells. If do choose to try it, then both the National Trust (which owns or manages about 20% of the park) and the Lake District National Park Authority publish good-practice guidelines, which are very sensible, given the fragility of this exposed, weather-beaten landscape, and the risks of provoking a reaction from the authorities. Essentially, you need to wait till dusk before pitching your tent — for one night only — and it must be above the highest fell wall, away from streams, tarns and lakes, and out of sight of both houses and other campers. Avoid all fire-making and carry out everything with you afterwards. Yes, that sounds stringent, but you may find it worth every hassle to inhabit, albeit briefly, such a raw and empty place.\n\n(6 of the best places for wild sleeping in England and Wales.)\n\nIn the Romanian Făgăraș Mountains nights are spent lake-side. Photograph by Alexandr Spatari, Getty Images\n\n7. Făgăraș Mountains, Romania\n\nWild camping isn’t allowed on protected land in Romania, be it a national park, nature reserve or national monument. Campfires are not generally permitted either, unless it’s in a designated fire pit. But that still leaves plenty of tempting possibilities — notably the five-day traverse of the Făgăraș Mountains in the southern Carpathians. Rising to 8,346ft, it’s a rugged but magnificent route and, despite the knife-edge terrain, there are plenty of places where you can descend a few hundred feet off the ridgeline to camp beside lakes and streams. Access is via Valea Fratelui railway station at the western end and Zărnești station in the east and you should always walk with at least one friend. Up on the ridge, you’re well above the treeline, which reduces the risk of bear encounters, too, but the sheepdogs can be pretty fierce in these parts, so stay vigilant and respectful.",

        "content": "Why the Congo Basin appears to be more resilient than the Amazon remains an incredibly complex question, and researchers are looking for answers in the trees. Back at Yangambi, Yakusu leads me down a trail through the surrounding forest and then signals that we should head deeper into the underbrush. As we leave the path, the texture of the ground suddenly changes, crackling softly as dried branches snap beneath our feet and then grow squishy as we step over the soft husk of a decomposing tree trunk. We finally stop in front of a huge tree with a wide, smooth trunk that juts high into the canopy. Part of the mahogany family of trees, it belongs to a particular native species called Entandrophragma utile.\n\nThe tree is part of another long-term survey that’s been happening at the station. To inspect it properly, Yakusu unslings his backpack and produces a wood borer shaped a bit like an oversize corkscrew, placing it against the trunk a few feet above the ground. When he turns the handle, the hardwood seems to resist at first, creaking under the pressure being applied. After a few minutes, Yakusu extracts a long, thin core sample of wood from the inner layers, which he carefully inserts into a protective sleeve. “You have to be careful to not let it break,” he says.\n\nInside the station’s modern wood biology lab—another first in the DRC—researchers would be able to compare the tree’s height and trunk diameter with visible rings from the core sample to determine changes in its growth over time in relation to the climate. “As we’ve demonstrated, the rainforest is warming,” Yakusu says. “This means that the environment in which these trees grow is changing and the conditions for growth are no longer optimal.” In the long run, decreased tree growth could lead to higher tree mortality in the region, one factor responsible for the Amazon’s diminishing capacity to store carbon.\n\nAlready some tree species are disappearing. In the research station’s archives, detailed records on a tree from the same genus, Entandrophragma palustre, show that it was once the most studied species at Yangambi. “But in this forest, you won’t find a single palustre today,” says Yakusu. At the same time, some trees are proving more resistant to extreme climate shifts, which could hold the key to helping the forest adapt. Chadrack Kafuti and Brice Djiofack, two tropical ecologists working at Yangambi’s wood lab, have been closely studying the adaptations of Pericopsis elata, a large-leaved hardwood with the surprising capacity to pause its growth during periods of drought or when sunlight is scarce. That kind of resilience could help direct replanting in areas where the forest has been logged for lumber or affected by wildfires, which are increasingly common.\n\n(Our report on when the Congo Basin reopened to large-scale logging.)",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "‘It’s the curvy path’\n\nThis whole journey started because Roberts’ took a leap of faith.\n\nAs a media professional, Roberts has worked for CosmoGirl, Essence, Ebony and Heart & Soul magazines. She eventually started her own entrepreneurial publishing nonprofit endeavors, sharing stories of women changemakers around the world. She followed a job to D.C. in 2016, and visited the newly-inaugurated National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\n“That’s how I saw the photograph that changed everything.”\n\nHad she not moved to D.C., she says she may not have visited the museum. And had she visited as tourist and not a resident, she may not have meandered the museum’s halls with such leisure, and she may not have taken notice of the details of one portrait in particular.\n\n“I think all of those things were leading me to this moment. It’s all connected, it’s the curvy path,” says Roberts.\n\nThe photo of a crew of Black women in wet suits aboard a boat was her first encounter with DWP. It beckoned her to follow. She phoned the co-founder, Kenneth Steward. She pledged to join them.\n\n“The universe works in strange ways,” says Roberts, reflecting on how she grew up nowhere near an ocean.\n\n“I imagined the divers. And then I imagined myself as one of them. I didn’t know it would lead anywhere, I just knew I wanted to know more.”\n\nSo she quit her job to follow the divers and help tell their stories.\n\nA way of honoring ancestors\n\nThe March, 2022 issue of National Geographic magazine featured Roberts, making her the first Black woman Explorer to grace the cover of the publication. Photograph by Wayne Lawrence\n\nRoberts’ path shows a nuanced story as she ricochets from peaks and valleys toward a calling. It’s the detail and complexity she aims for in the narratives she uncovers in her work.\n\n“Think about the Clotilda shipwreck… that’s a story that no one would know if the Clotilda descendants hadn’t been like ‘oh, we have saved artifacts and the stories of our ancestors, we’re not going to let anyone forget them.’”\n\nThe Clotilda , Roberts reflects, represents a uniquely complete story. The vessel sailed in 1860, illegally transporting captive Africans from present-day Benin to Mobile, Alabama. It is said a wealthy landowner by the name of Timothy Meaher challenged Northern businessmen with a thousand-dollar wager, claiming he could slip African people past federal officials and into Mobile Bay.\n\nThe ship itself is remarkably well-preserved in the muddy freshwater of Alabama’s Mobile River, compared to other wrecks, which are often shattered on the sea floor, coalesced into the marine ecosystem, or dissolved over time. And the Clotilda’s African survivors, who were removed from the ship as the captain burned it to hide evidence, established the community of Africatown in Mobile once they were freed from enslavement after the Civil War. They neighborhood they established eventually grew into a community of tens of thousands, including their descendants. It still exists today and which continues to honor the stories of those ancestors from the nation’s last known slave ship.\n\n“That's often not what you get around stories that involve African Americans,\" Roberts says. \"Most of us cannot trace our histories all the way back to a slave ship or to a particular country in Africa because the records of the enslaved were not recorded in detail. So it’s incredible and very powerful that these descendants know the actual stories of their ancestors that came from Africa.\"\n\nFor the podcast Roberts interviewed not only the descendants of those on slave ships, but close to 100 other historians, archaeologists and community members about their unique relationships to this history. “By the end of it, I realized that these weren’t just stories of death, that these were stories of life, too,” Roberts recalls.\n\n“It’s a complicated history, but that’s the way history is supposed to be.”\n\nThe Christianus Quintus and Federicus Quartus wreck site were the first dive Roberts recalls leaving an impression on her, “I felt more than anything a sense of agency and power,” she says.\n\nIn 1710 two Danish slave ships, the Christianus Quintus and Fredericus Quartus went down in the Atlantic. Some 40,000 Danish bricks signaled the wreckage to experts in the 1970s, despite their considerable decomposition. A cannon and large anchor are still laid out as artifacts on the seabed. After quashing a revolt, the two vessels veered off course, missing their St. Thomas destinations by over a thousand miles, the crews mutinied, freed approximately 650 captive people due to dwindling resources, and scuttled the vessels which now lie in the ocean sands of present-day Costa Rica.\n\nAs the site came into view for Roberts, “I felt, ‘I see you and I’m going to help bring this story back to human memory. We are going to help make sure you are honored, not forgotten.’”",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "New Yorkers aren’t afraid of a little schmutz. When Queens-born Chef Shuai Wang and his wife Corrie went hunting for a spot to open their new Charleston restaurant, they wanted a place that was both affordable and authentically homegrown—a tall order in a city where home prices frequently soar past $2 million and two-bedroom apartments cost $4,000 to rent a month.\n\nThe couple found their answer in Park Circle, a 110-year-old historic garden neighborhood in a fast-changing, working-class community called North Charleston with a gritty heritage standing in stark contrast to the genteel, steeple-stippled skyline, expensive boutiques, and luxury hotels further south. For Wang, who starred in the most recent season of Bravo’s Top Chef, that difference felt right.\n\n\"Park Circle is Charleston's Williamsburg,\" he says, drawing parallels to Brooklyn's once-scruffy creative enclave.\n\nIn 2010, Park Circle was the first to celebrate LGBTQ+ Pride in Charleston, and it has become the home to annual music events such as the Riverfront Revival and Rockabillaque. Photograph By North Charleston, via Flickr Creative Commons\n\nCharleston’s new artist district\n\nThe couple opened Jackrabbit Filly on Spruill Avenue five years ago (recently relocating it to nearby East Montague Avenue). They weren't alone. Only a 16-minute Uber ride from downtown Charleston’s Marion Square, Park Circle has quietly become the Holy City’s vibrant magnet, drawing residents priced out of living \"below the neck\"—the stretch of peninsula wedged between the Ashley and Cooper rivers and separating North Charleston from the bourgeois world of the historic city.\n\nNo such airs are on display in Jackrabbit Filly, the 1970s wood-paneled walls furnished with quixotic thrift-store finds contrast with intricate wood screens imported from China. There’s a clatter of plates and the hum of conversation coming from the 44 tables, all booked. The air is filled with aromas of soy vinegar and chili oil, and there is anticipation for dishes such as glass noodles and the Japanese fried chicken known as karaage, so popular devotees drive from miles around to enjoy the food and atmosphere. That’s no surprise to Pearce Fleming, whose airy microbrewery Commonhouse Aleworks sits around the corner.\n\n\"Park Circle's a place that fosters community,\" he says. “It’s what we try to do at our brewery. We exist to bring people together to celebrate over a pint of social lubricant.\"\n\nLocated in the Park Circle neighborhood, Riverfront Park features the Greater Charleston Navel Base Memorial and an 800-foot boardwalk along Cooper River. Photograph By Brooke Becker, Shutterstock\n\nTo encourage that conviviality, Fleming, whose brews include IPAs “Navy Town” and “Park Circle” named for his neighborhood, helped establish one of the community’s biggest festivals. In 2010, Park Circle was the first to celebrate Pride in Charleston, which it continues to do to this day with more than 40 participating organizations. Now, other annual events like the musically minded Riverfront Revival and Rockabillaque, featuring rockabilly music, classic cars, and barbecue, draw thousands of people.\n\nMusic is center stage throughout the year at other venues including Holy City Brewing and the Firefly Distillery, famous for its sweet tea vodka. Visitors can sample the lemony-flavored drink, and its bourbons and whiskeys, in its tasting room. Outside, Firefly’s five-acre music space regularly hosts bands. Past performers included Chappell Roan and Willie Nelson.\n\nFirefly Distillery has a five-acre music space to host music concerts. Previous performers include Chappell Roan, Willie Nelson, Vampire Weekend, and Lupe Fiasco. Photograph By Firefly Distillery\n\nThe history of a streetcar suburb\n\nWhile a Roan concert wasn’t what its founders could ever imagine, Park Circle is finally fulfilling its original intention in some ways. The neighborhood began as a genteel gamble in the 1910s when city businessmen envisioned a streetcar suburb that would lure young professionals and their families north of Charleston's traditional boundaries. \"They couldn't kick start interest in moving there,\" says Brittany Lavelle Tulla, an architectural historian at BVL Historic Preservation Research. \"It couldn’t just get off its feet.\"\n\nInstead, the US Navy took center stage. Its base, the Naval Complex, employed 25,000 workers at its World War II peak. Workers performed a variety of duties from disassembling Nazi U-boats to maintaining Cold War fleets. Their communities—which would incorporate as the city of North Charleston in 1972—earned a brawling, blue-collar reputation immortalized in Pat Conroy's novel \"The Lords of Discipline.\"\n\n(Related: Charleston’s newest museum reckons with the city’s role in the slave trade.)\n\nA burgeoning neighborhood with ties to its historic past\n\nYet Park Circle’s original garden city design endured. The central circular park, that gave the neighborhood its name, still anchored streets that radiated outward like spokes. When the base closed in 1996, that historic blueprint, combined with the bungalows, worker cottages, and mid-century buildings left behind, created perfect conditions for renewal. Young entrepreneurs and artists soon discovered East Montague Avenue's wide, herringbone-bricked sidewalks—perfect for outdoor cafes, kids, and dogs—and a new chapter began.\n\nThe avenue’s shops reflect the neighborhood’s eclectic spirit. Neighborly modern furniture shares space with local artisans’ work. Odd Duck Market sells food and coffee, while Black Octopus Mercantile transformed surf wear into streetwear. The shop is a cheery place, probably due to the ebullience of owner Missy Johnson, who designs most of the merchandise herself. Some of it is regularly featured on the hit teen drama The Outer Banks.\n\n“I love being in Park Circle,” she says. “We may be off the beaten track but we’re quite the gem of the realm sitting between the pine trees and the river.”\n\nThe river that Johnson is referring to is Cooper River, where the old naval facilities are also undergoing a metamorphosis.The 140-acre Riverfront Park now occupies part of the former base, including grounds initially landscaped in 1896 by the famed Olmsted Brothers firm for a project predating the naval yards. Walking paths crisscross beneath century-old live oaks, leading to a 1,200-foot boardwalk jutting into the water.\n\nIn North Charleston, the 55-foot-tall steel arches of the Noisette Creek Pedestrian Bridge connects Riverfront Park to the River District North development, 70 acres of former naval land that will be transformed into a village with housing, offices, and retail spaces. Photogrpah By Charlotte Evelyn, Shutterstock\n\nThe former base commander's Colonial Revival mansion and its columned porches, or “piazzas” in local parlance, is now an event space overlooking the river where anglers cast for red drum, spotted sea trout, and flounder. The graceful Noisette Creek Pedestrian Bridge and its two 55-foot-tall steel arches connect the park to the River District North development, an ambitious plan where 70 acres of former naval land will become a mixed-used village with housing, offices, and retail spaces.\n\nWhile the River District North promises a glossy future, Park Circle’s past isn't forgotten. Kelsey Bacon, a floral designer at Roadside Blooms, bridges both. Her great “grand mamie” Virginia Kirkland toiled in the naval factories during WWII. Bacon thinks she would have been amazed to see the transformations that have turned the community into the one now on travelers’ itineraries.\n\n“It's a melting pot of different lives and different people, says Bacon. “As long as I’m in Charleston I’ll be in Park Circle.”\n\n(Related: Discover the best of Charleston with these top 10 things to do.)\n\nWhat you should know\n\nWhere to eat: The tide-to-table Walrus Raw Bar inside Holy City Brewing offers the chance to slurp local oysters and quaff an array of artisanal beers. On East Montague, Southern Roots Smokehouse features brisket, chicken wings, and traditional barbecue sides. Across the street, EVO Pizza offers wood-fired pies like pistachio pesto or the pork trifecta with a farmer’s salad.\n\nWhere to stay: Airbnbs on offer in the neighborhood. Something new in North Charleston: The Starlight Motor Inn, an authentic 1961 motel with strong mid-century modern design vibes and live music in its upstairs bar The Burgundy Lounge (Rates from $100). Downtown, The Ryder, which opened in 2021, offers a contemporary vibe different than many of the traditional hotels (Rates from $203)\n\nWhat to do: New last year, The Park Circle Playground is the country’s largest inclusive playground designed to allow full accessibility to children with autism, sensory issues, or in wheelchairs full accessibility. For playful adults, retro Pinky and Clyde’s Arcade Bar on East Montague lets patrons play vintage video games like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man. On Spruill Avenue, the Station offers shoppers vintage housewares and clothing as well as new art and fashions curated by a changing mix of some 30 artists, designers, and thrifters.\n\n(Related: 10 of the best hotels in Charleston, from historic landmarks to hipster hotspots.)",

        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nWrapping up the best of west Somerset and North Devon’s coast and hinterland, Exmoor is the least-visited UK national park, which is a travesty — but a boon for those who do come. Because a certain magic hangs over its pony-grazed uplands, wooded combes, sea cliffs and untamed shores — one enhanced by Exmoor’s human stories. Across the park you’ll find prehistoric standing stones and burial mounds; the ghosts of medieval settlements and remnant churches such as tiny Culbone; the echoes of ardent visitors Wordsworth, Coleridge and Shelley; and even a ‘holy mountain’, Holdstone Down, a place of pilgrimage for UFO-spotters. While the latter’s extra-terrestrial connections are moot, there’s no denying Exmoor is a great spot to ponder the universe. With minimal light pollution lending it some of England’s blackest nights, the park was made Europe’s first International Dark Sky Reserve in 2011. The Exmoor Dark Skies Festival is held here in autumn, but stargazers can get their fill year-round at recommended observation sites, with telescopes available to hire from National Park Centres in Dulverton, Dunster and Lynmouth.\n\nStargazers can get their fill year-round at recommended observation sites.

Photograph by ImageBROKER, AWL Images Ltd\n\nWhere can I lace up my walking boots?\n\nEverywhere — Exmoor is hiking heaven. The first (or last) stages of the 630-mile South West Coast Path trace the park’s windswept shoreline, while the 51-mile Coleridge Way runs from Somerset’s Quantock Hills into Exmoor via landscapes that inspired the Romantic poet. An eight-miler from the village of Wheddon Cross skirts 1,702ft Dunkery Beacon (Exmoor’s highest point) and descends through the ancient oaks of Horner Wood to Porlock, home of the fabled man who interrupted Coleridge while he was writing his poem Kubla Khan in the hamlet of Culbone. The park’s country pubs make good walking hubs, too. A 7.5-mile loop starting from the Royal Oak, in Withypool, takes in Britain’s longest medieval clapper bridge — Tarr Steps, a set of huge slabs across the River Barle.\n\n“On clear nights, the Larkbarrow area has a unique quality. Follow the Dark Sky Discovery Trail to the old farm ruins – the stars will be amazing.” Tim Parish, Exmoor National Park ranger , Local tip\n\nWhere’s good for a pint and a bite?\n\nYou’ll find Exmoor Ales’ microbrewery in Wiveliscombe, but its beers can be sampled at pubs park-wide. Head to Simonsbath, where The Exmoor Forest Inn serves refreshing pints of ‘Gold’ and ‘Beast’, as well as grass-fed beef from the estate’s organic hill farm. In 2024, the inn earned a Michelin Green star for its responsible sourcing and nose-to-tail philosophy. Woods, a pub with a restaurant in Dulverton, also serves interesting beers and wines (it won the Good Pub Guide’s Wine Pub of the Year award 10 years running). Drinks accompany smart dishes built around produce from the owner’s farm. For a Devon cream tea, you have two exceptionally scenic options, including the National Trust’s Watersmeet cafe, tucked away in a leafy ravine at the confluence of the East Lyn River and Hoar Oak Water. It’s pipped, however, by Lee Abbey Tea Cottage, which — weather permitting — serves homemade cakes and bakes in idyllic gardens behind Lee Bay.\n\nWoods is an award-winning pub in the village of Dulverton. Photograph by Christopher Jones, Alamy\n\nWhat about places to stay?\n\nLocanda on the Weir is a boutique four-bedroom B & B scattered with eclectic artworks, exotic fabrics and vintage furniture (from £200, B & B). Overlooking Porlock Bay, it’s renowned for its food: chef and co-owner Pio Catemario Di Quadri runs a zero-waste kitchen where he creates seasonal dishes using local ingredients, some grown in his own garden, others foraged nearby. Further along the coast is The Hunter’s Inn, an arts-and-crafts-style hotel in a wooded ravine by Heddon’s Mouth, where a rocky beach lies between sea cliffs (from £190, B & B). Access is via precipitous narrow roads, or on foot via the coast path. Just south of the park, by dark sky observation site Molland Moor, you’ll find five off-grid boltholes from Rest + Wild (from £175). Stargaze from each cabin’s al fresco copper bath, around its fire pit or through the king-size windows by the king-size bed.\n\nHow to do it Trains run to Taunton and Tiverton Parkway from hubs like London and Bristol, while the scenic Tarka Line runs to Barnstaple from Exeter. Some local buses serve the park , including the seasonal Exmoor Coaster.",

It was one of the most extraordinary sightings of a leopard I’ve ever had.”\n\nIn 25 years of wildlife storytelling, National Geographic Explorer Sandesh Kadur has seen and documented more rare moments in nature than most people experience in a lifetime.\n\n“Then, the leopard goes to the tree next to us and puts its paws up. It scratches the tree, puts its paws down, saws and disappears into the darkness,” Kadur recalls of the moment that set him on the course of his life’s work.\n\nHe was a 15-year-old boy in Bangalore, India who had buried himself in books about big cats, mostly books by hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett . Inspired, Kadur and a friend rode their bikes into the jungle one night and pedaled toward a particular tree that sat above a watering hole, one frequented by the “man-eating tigers or leopards” described in Cobertt’s literature. Kadur had, in his imagination, camped out with Corbett in moonlit trees several times before, waiting for big cats. This time it was real.\n\n“In that beautiful dappled moonlight and shadow, that’s when I realized that this was what I wanted to do when I grew up. Experience moments like this, capture them and share them with the world.”\n\nAs an acclaimed wildlife filmmaker and photographer, Kadur has dedicated his life to illuminating endangered species and their fragile habitats. He shares them with the world through his visual storytelling, which offers his audiences first-time glimpses into rarely-seen phenomena in the natural world, and urges viewers to protect its vulnerable inhabitants.",

But what if we could make our blood poisonous to the parasites that crave it?\n\nWhile it sounds like science fiction, the idea isn’t as far-fetched as it might sound.\n\nIn a study published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine, scientists report that a drug known as nitisinone can turn human blood so toxic to mosquitoes that they die within a few hours of feeding on samples from patients who received even relatively low doses. What’s more, the drug remains effective for up to 16 days after the initial dosing.\n\nIt’s important to note that nitisinone does not itself protect against malaria infection. However, by killing the mosquitoes before they can lay eggs, the drug might be able to knock down disease-transmitting mosquito populations to the point that it breaks the chain of infection.\n\nLike a vaccine that relies on herd immunity then, the promise isn’t in being individually immune to malaria, but rather working together as a community to snuff out an outbreak.",

        "content": "On winter evenings throughout much of Europe and North America, an hour before sunset, thousands of starlings gather in the skies. Before descending to their nighttime roosts, the birds put on one of nature’s most spectacular displays. They pulse, ripple, and wheel as if they were a single entity—an amorphous, shape-shifting creature with the delicate beauty of calligraphic brushstrokes and the erratic chaos of flickering flames.\n\nHow could so many birds be so tightly coordinated? That’s a mystery that researchers have sought to solve for more than a century. In 1931, the ornithologist Edmund Selous argued that a starling murmuration, which he described as “a madness in the sky,” could only arise through telepathy. The birds “must think collectively, all at the same time,” he wrote. Like many others, Selous assumed that complex behavior must have equally complex origins. But in the 1980s, programmers and physicists started showing otherwise. They created computer models in which virtual individuals interacted according to deceptively simple rules but nonetheless moved in ways that resembled coordinated flocks. These simulations were compelling, but researchers lacked good data on actual flocks to compare them against. Then, in 2005, a team led by married physicists Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina in Rome took a giant leap forward. Over many chilly evenings across three years, they climbed to the rooftop of the Palazzo Massimo to photograph the city’s especially epic murmurations with pairs of cameras. Using these images, they reconstructed the 3D position of each individual in murmurations that included more than 4,000 members.\n\n(Starling murmurations are dazzling, ubiquitous, and puzzling.)",

        "title": "What Is Happening to Social Security Under Trump?",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Since President Donald Trump has returned to the White House, a core focus of his presidency has been to eliminate waste in the federal government, an effort spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), under the watchful eye of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Several departments and agencies have been subjected to major funding cuts and mass layoffs. Meanwhile, the Department of Education faces the potential of being dismantled entirely. However, one agency that has been the subject of mixed messages from the Trump Administration is Social Security—a program which sends retirement and disability benefits to over 70 million people through the Social Security Administration (SSA). In the fiscal year of 2024, over 20% of the federal budget was spent on Social Security, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFrom a messaging standpoint, Trump has maintained that he will not touch Social Security—while some cabinet members have cast doubt on whether or not those who receive Social Security benefits should be concerned. At the same time, reports of planned DOGE-driven cuts and office closures at the agency have led experts to wonder whether the SSA will have the staff required to ensure the checks are counted and delivered on time. On March 26, Democrats held a press briefing that addressed their concerns about planned Social Security cuts, Trump’s new nominee to lead the SSA, and the security of citizens’ information through SSA. “Their goal is clear: destroy Social Security from within. Make it so unworkable, so inefficient, that Donald Trump has the pretext to slash benefits to kill it and then privatize the program,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said at the conference. “Seniors across America are not getting the help they need to get their checks.”\n\nHere’s what you need to know about what’s happening to Social Security under the Trump Administration. What has happened to Social Security since Trump returned to the Oval Office? DOGE plans to reportedly cut thousands of jobs at the SSA and close offices. Plus, there is also concern the introduction of new identification policies that require people to come to field offices or access information online instead of utilizing phone calls, something that could alienate older generations or people from rural communities. The Trump Administration has called for substantial layoffs for SSA employees, with leadership saying it will cut 7,000 of its 57,000 staff. On March 18, the SSA announced that they would be “implementing stronger identity verification procedures,” procedures that would end verification of identity over the phone Several advocacy groups, including AARP, formerly the American Association for Retired Persons, have come out to request that the SSA “rethink” these requirements.\n\n“Requiring rural Americans to go into an office can mean having to take a day off of work and drive for hours merely to fill out paperwork,” AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond said in a statement on March 19. “We urge the agency to reverse this decision, or for Congress to step in and stand up for older Americans everywhere.” Meanwhile, others have been concerned about DOGE’s potential access to the sensitive information held by the SSA. In a ruling in Maryland, one judge ruled to block DOGE from having access to SSA data banks, granting a temporary restraining order. Judge Ellen Hollander determined that “defendants, with so called experts on the DOGE team, never identified or articulated even a single reason for which the DOGE team needs unlimited access to SSA’s entire record systems.” According to the filing, defendants claimed that 10 members of the DOGE team were working at SSA, and that seven of those had access to personally identifiable information contained in the SSA data systems.\n\nRead More: Cybersecurity Experts Are Sounding the Alarm on DOGE What has Trump and his cabinet members said about Social Security? The Trump Administration has made it clear they plan to not cut benefits from Social Security. In a “fact check\" posted to the White House website on March 11, Trump said that they will “not cut” the program. Still, the Administration said that they believe in cutting wasteful spending within said program. “The Social Security Administration made an estimated $72 billion in improper payments between 2015 and 2022,” the fact sheet stated. “What kind of a person doesn’t support eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending that ultimately costs taxpayers more?” Meanwhile, Musk has been critical of Social Security, notably calling it “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan. “The waste and fraud in entitlement spending” is the “big one to eliminate,” Musk said elsewhere, in an interview with Fox Business\n\nNewly-instated Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has also received backlash over his comments about the program, stating that his mother-in-law “wouldn’t call and complain” if Social Security missed a check. “A fraudster always makes the loudest noise,” he continued. The backlash for Lutnick has come from all sides—including his own party as former Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Michael Steele noted on MSNBC that while Lutnick is seemingly in a financial position that allows him to support his family, many families are not as fortunate. “This is the problem when elites base policy on their own experience,” says Teresa Ghilarducci, professor of economics at the New School for Social Research, pointing out that for millions of seniors, missing a Social Security check would be an “emergency.” Who is Trump’s nominee to lead the Social Security Administration? Trump’s nominee to be the SSA Commissioner is Frank Bisignano, the CEO of payment processing company Fiserv and a self-proclaimed “DOGE person.” Bisignano was grilled at his confirmation hearing on March 25, where he was asked about proposed changes and cuts by Musk and issues at the agency.\n\nBisignano said he would be an “accountable leader” at SSA, and that he had “no intent” of benefit cuts occurring under his watch. Asked during the hearing whether Social Security should be privatized, Bisignano said “I’ve never heard a word of it, and I’ve never thought about it.” However, experts have expressed concern. Pamela Herd, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, says she was not convinced that Bisignano’s hearing showed he will keep the SSA out of chaos. “He wouldn't, or didn't really seem to commit to maintaining staffing levels,” says Herd. “Instead, he talked about solutions, like using AI. He spent a lot of time and really emphasized that he wanted to focus on reducing payment errors.” Ghilarducci says that when she first heard that Bisignano was nominated, she was optimistic about the idea of him leading. At the hearing, though, she says he sounded “ideological.”\n\n“He respects DOGE, maybe because they are disrupters, and he is going to lift up their role in the Social Security system, which is about demeaning the system and then eroding it, and then building up to what they believe is minimally necessary,” Ghilarducci says. “There [could be] a lot of wreckage, human wreckage along the way.” Should people be concerned about their Social Security? According to Herd, the short answer for whether or not people should be concerned about Social Security is a resounding “yes.” With significant staff cuts, she says it is less a question of whether or not any benefits will actually get cut, but whether the SSA will have the staff to actually “deliver the benefits that the Congress has mandated that they deliver.” “People are waiting for hours to get through on the phone and then getting cut off before they can actually talk to a representative. The field offices, that honestly were already a bit overwhelmed [already], are now completely overwhelmed,” she says. “So there's a real disconnect between the statement, ‘I'm not going to cut benefits,’ and in practice, what is going on in the agency.”\n\nHerd states that while DOGE cuts are supposedly, according to Musk, about eliminating waste and fraud, the staffing and procedures that are being cut and changed at the SSA are “needed” to prevent fraud and abuse.\n\n“You can't manage 20% of the federal budget on a shoestring. You need actual capacity in that agency, and they've made a series of choices in the last six weeks alone that have significantly undermined capacity of that agency,” Herd says. “People aren't going to be able to pay their bills if the agency can't deliver on the benefits of people with good promise.”\n\nGhilarducci says that in the past few years, Republicans have mostly stayed away from issues of Social Security. With these changes to the SSA and DOGE’s focus on the agency, they’re testing the electorate, she claims.\n\n“If they wanted a subject to start a political uprising to the whole Republican agenda… they found it,” Ghilarducci says. “They may have stepped on the land mine, because we're already seeing protests and distrust all over the country.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "title": "Exclusive: Louis DeJoy Resigns as Postmaster General",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Louis DeJoy has resigned from his role as Postmaster General of the U.S. Postal Service, according to a source familiar with the matter. He told the USPS Board of Governors on Monday that it would be his last day on the job, naming Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino as his replacement until the Board names a permanent successor. Shortly after this story’s publication, DeJoy released a statement confirming his resignation. His sudden departure comes after he struck an agreement earlier this month to allow Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency inside the USPS to cut costs and remove bureaucratic red tape. DeJoy’s allies fear that his absence will leave the agency vulnerable to a dramatic and disruptive takeover by the Trump Administration. Both President Donald Trump and Musk have recently floated ideas to reshape the beloved institution, such as privatizing the Post Office or folding it into the Commerce Department. “It’s been just a tremendous loser for this country,” Trump said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn a letter to the agency’s 640,000 employees, DeJoy, 67, expressed confidence that Tulino and the organization could continue steering the USPS toward financial sustainability, saying “the entirety of the Postal Service will aggressively shape its future and become more efficient, capable, and competitive as it continuously changes and improves to best serve the American public.” Since taking the helm in 2020, DeJoy launched a 10-year plan to remake the USPS and save it from insolvency. He built new processing centers and modernized the delivery network. He renegotiated contracts for air and ground transportation to eliminate billions in expenses. Most consequentially, he shepherded major legislation through Congress to rescind a 2006 law requiring the Postal Service to prepay the next 50 years of health and retirement benefits for its entire workforce—a rule no other federal agency was forced to follow. Those changes have been starting to bear fruit. In the final quarter of 2024, the USPS made $144 million, its first profitable period in years.\n\nRead more: Louis DeJoy’s Surprising Second Act Still, DeJoy was always planning to step aside this year. Last month, he told the Board to start looking for a successor, ending a five-year tenure running the agency through a pandemic, three elections that relied heavily on mail voting, and his logistical overhaul. But he originally planned to stay in the position for several more months, helping the USPS transition to a new leader. A source familiar with the matter tells TIME that DeJoy had clashed in recent days with DOGE representatives assigned to the Postal Service, whom he tasked with reviewing the agency’s structural problems that he ascribed to a law passed in the 1970s. Musk’s lieutenants wanted more control over the USPS than DeJoy was willing to allow, a source familiar with the matter says. DOGE officials complained that DeJoy was “uncooperative.” Some suspect that DeJoy stepped aside to prevent a larger conflagration.\n\nFor DeJoy, it’s a somber end to his government career. After making a fortune building a logistics firm worth more than $600 million, he became a GOP megadonor and helped to raise millions for Trump. He was set to serve as the official host of the 2020 Republican National Convention until the USPS Board asked him to become Postmaster General. Taking over in the thick of COVID-19, he initially struggled to transition from life as a corporate executive to a high-level bureaucrat. But, by his own admission, he grew to love the job and the arduous project of trying to rescue the agency from existential threats, even as Democrats and Republicans alike called for his removal. On his watch, the USPS struggled with on-time delivery and meeting its own service standards. But when the Postal Service turned a profit for the first time in years, it was a sign that his plan might be working for the only delivery service that reaches every American in every corner of the country. Yet for all his turnaround efforts—and his history as a Trump backer—it was not enough to withstand Trump’s war on Washington.\n\nNow, he will be leaving the agency unsure of what will follow him. “It has been one of the pleasures of my life and a crowning achievement of my career to have been associated with this cherished institution,” he wrote to his colleagues on Monday, “the United States Postal Service.”\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

        "title": "Why You Should Write Your Own Eulogy",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Have you ever lost a loved one who left important words unsaid? Did you wonder if they really loved you, or did you have an argument with them right before they died? As a hospice nurse and the founder of Doulagivers Institute, and as someone who has been at the bedside of over 1,000 dying patients, I know how important it is to say everything you need to say at the end of life. That’s why I recommend that everyone, young and old, sick or healthy, write their own eulogy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday, many are rethinking what a funeral service needs to look like. Some are looking back to older traditions by readopting the practice of home wakes and funerals. Others are creating new traditions, showing that there are so many more ways to celebrate a life well-lived than the conventional options. Turning the traditional eulogy into a personally written goodbye can be an empowering and beautiful way to say “I love you” one more time. A eulogy is usually a heartfelt tribute that someone else delivers at the funeral or memorial service. Sometimes, it’s a family member or close friend, but often, it’s a clergy member who may not even know us well. As a death doula, I’ve attended many funerals. But I have never felt more love and healing at one than when a first-person eulogy is read. It’s powerful. Everyone in the room feels they get to have one last conversation with the person they’ve lost. When that conversation is filled with love, it’s the best possible salve for grief. It doesn’t mean others can’t say their own eulogies, but there’s something special about hearing directly from the person everyone misses so much.\n\nRead More: What a Hospice Nurse Wants You to Know About Death When you write your own eulogy to be read after you’re gone, it’s wonderful to know that you’ve left behind a message for everyone you love to help them get through the loss. Even if you aren’t ill and even if you’re still young, you will feel a sense of relief in knowing your eulogy is ready just in case. Of course, none of us wants to think about our death. It can be scary. But I've learned that we can release some of that fear by taking back our control—when we take care of our final plans in advance, we can feel more at ease and at peace, rather than afraid of the unknown. It can also be an opportunity to communicate life lessons you’ve amassed along the way, especially if you’re leaving behind young children or grandchildren. I know someone who wrote about working too much in his younger days before he finally learned that it was more important to spend valuable time with his family. He talked about this in his eulogy, recounting some of the memories he had with his children, wife, and parents that he wouldn’t have had if he’d been working overtime. It meant less money for exotic vacations, but as he put it, “seeing the Great Wall of China will never compare to watching my five-year-old perform in a kindergarten play.”\n\nA first-person eulogy is the perfect place to say apologies you’ve never been able to say face-to-face and bury the hatchet on any arguments before your death. For estranged relationships or those that ended in conflict, a pre-written eulogy can offer comforting closure. It can turn a sad occasion into a powerful, healing experience. Read More: Let’s Talk About Our Grief Some people use their eulogy as a chance to apologize for their very human shortcomings, assuring their loved ones that they did their best even when they fell short and that they hope the people left behind will be able to remember the good times more often than the painful ones. Most importantly, your eulogy is your occasion to express your caring and appreciation for the people you love. You can let them know how important they have been to you, what you admire about them, and what they’ve done for you that has been enormously valuable in your life. Even if you’ve already said it to them directly, saying it to them one more time after you’re gone will be enormously meaningful to them.\n\nIf you have children, telling them how proud you are will stay with them forever. I recommend being specific about it. Speak to each child about their individual strengths that you admire, and provide encouragement and confidence that they can take with them. It’s your opportunity to tell them how much you believe in them and the life they can create, despite whatever challenges they might have experienced. If your child is struggling, this can be a remarkable boost for them as they grieve.\n\nYou can’t always count on being able to say goodbye to those you love. Even in the case of a prolonged illness, you might be unconscious or too weak to do it. By writing your own first-person eulogy ahead of time, you get to say goodbye to everyone who has had an impact on you—not just family members and close friends, but also coworkers, mentors, and community members you want to remember and convey your feelings about. When you write while you’re still feeling healthy, you’ll be less likely to forget anyone, and you can always add to the list as necessary. Doing this in advance is an incredibly empowering and comforting experience that will allow you to leave nothing unsaid.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Not all state capitols have a collection of presidential portraits, but Colorado is proud to be one that does. Now, however, President Donald Trump has pushed for his portrait to be removed. “Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Sunday night. “I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTrump said that “many people” from Colorado have complained about the portrait to him: “In fact, they are actually angry about it!” He added that he’s contacted Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis (whom Trump called a “Radical Left Governor” who is “extremely weak on Crime”) to take the portrait down. “Jared should be ashamed of himself!” Trump concluded. A spokesperson for the governor’s office told Denver news outlet 9News on Sunday that Polis was “surprised to learn the President of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork. … We appreciate the President and everyone’s interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience.” On Monday, the Associated Press reported that the portrait will be taken down at the request of Colorado State Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Republican, who asked that Trump’s portrait be replaced by one “that depicts his contemporary likeness.” Colorado Democrats joined Republicans in approving an order to staff to remove the portrait from the Capitol gallery and store it in a secure location until further notice, saying in a statement: “If the GOP wants to spend time and money on which portrait of Trump hangs in the Capitol, then that’s up to them.”\n\nThe reality is it wasn’t Polis who commissioned the Trump portrait in the first place—nor any political opponent of the President. And it’s actually been up for years. Here’s what to know. Funding for the portraits in the Colorado State Capitol typically comes from private donations collected by Colorado Citizens for Culture, a grassroots organization supporting the arts in the state. During Trump’s first term, the group needed to raise $10,000 to commission a portrait of him, but in 2018, the organization’s president Jay Seller said not a single donation had come in. In July that year, a portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin was displayed on an easel in front of the empty spot where Trump’s portrait was expected to hang, after a member of nonprofit progressive advocacy organization ProgressNow Colorado snuck in. Katie March, the Democratic legislative staffer who swiped in the activist had her security clearances stripped and faced disciplinary action. “We hope that public awareness has been raised over the danger of Russian influence over the President of the United States,” ProgressNow Colorado’s executive director Ian Silverii told 9News. “Next time we’ll use the front door.”\n\nThe stunt ignited anger among Republicans, making national and international headlines, but it also highlighted the absence of Trump’s official portrait. Republican Kevin Grantham, then-President of the state senate, launched a GoFundMe to raise funds for a portrait. Within about 32 hours, the campaign met its $10,000 goal through donations from about 200 donors that included several notable state Republicans as well as former Democrat state representative Dan Pabon, who told Colorado Public Radio: “The hall of portraits of presidents is a tour showcase for any school-aged students coming through here, and I just wanted to make sure that when they came through they had the full experience of all the presidents that have been elected.” During the portrait’s August 2019 unveiling ceremony at the State Capitol, which was billed as a nonpartisan event though hosted by Colorado’s Senate Republicans, Grantham called the crowdfunding “fitting” for a “populist” such as Trump.\n\nSarah A. Boardman, a British-born artist based in Colorado Springs, was commissioned to paint the portrait. Boardman had also painted the portrait of Barack Obama, after Lawrence Williams, the artist who had painted all 43 previous presidential portraits, died in 2003. Boardman said at the unveiling ceremony that she tried to match the classical realist style of Williams’ paintings and that it took around four months to complete the painting of Trump, which was based on a photograph voted on and approved by the Capitol Building Advisory Committee. “My portrait of President Trump has been called thoughtful, non-confrontational, not angry, not happy, not tweeting,” Boardman said at the time. “In five, 10, 15, 20 years, he will be another President on the wall who is only historical background, and he needs to look neutral.” Grantham, who is now a county commissioner and remains a supporter of Trump on social media, told TIME in an interview on Monday that he was “a little surprised” by Trump’s complaint about the portrait. “It’s been six years since we put that portrait up, and we haven’t heard any dissent over it—in fact, quite the opposite. … People have said they liked it.”\n\nWhile he wasn’t part of the conversations behind the recent decision to remove and replace the portrait, Grantham said several people did reach out to him to see how he feels, the first being the governor, whom he says agreed that it was “not a big deal.” Grantham added that Polis wasn’t the governor when he started the GoFundMe campaign and that Polis had no involvement in the process of commissioning or unveiling the portrait. Grantham said he is “sorry to see” Trump “going off of misinformation given to him or maybe making assumptions” about what happened. Nevertheless, Grantham said he’s “OK” with the decision to remove and replace the portrait: “If the subject of the painting doesn’t really like the painting, why would we leave it up? If he sees something wrong with it, he doesn’t think it’s a fair characterization of him, or [it] just simply doesn’t meet his fancy, why would we go to any extraordinary lengths to keep it up? Let’s remove it, let’s reorganize tomorrow, and let’s talk about what we do now from this point forward. Let’s put a portrait up that works for both the people of Colorado and the President of the United States.”\n\nGrantham added that Boardman, who did not respond to TIME’s request for comment, is “a really, really good person and a good artist, and her legacy will not be tied to this little hiccup.”\n\nTrump’s not the only President to have found a portrait unflattering. Theodore Roosevelt loathed his White House portrait by French artist Theobald Chartran in 1902, saying it made him look like a “mewing cat.” He hid the work in his closet and ultimately had it destroyed and replaced with a different artist’s. Whether Trump’s removed portrait in Colorado faces a similar fate is unclear. There is, however, one portrait commissioned elsewhere that Trump is reportedly much more fond of: U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told conservative media commentator Tucker Carlson on Friday that Trump “was clearly touched” after Putin recently gave Witkoff a “beautiful” portrait of the U.S. President that the Russian President had commissioned a leading Russian artist to paint.",

        "title": "AI May Make it Even Harder to Find a Job",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Entering 2025, underlying the calm surface of the U.S. labor market were currents of anxiety, dissatisfaction, and stagnation. Companies were taking longer to fill open roles, and a growing numbers of employees were disengaged but staying in their roles out of concern it would be difficult to find something better. Now, President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their Department of Government Efficiency have laid off thousands of federal employees. These workers are now re-entering the job market. Plus, companies and employees alike are trying to anticipate the impact of rollicking financial markets thanks to constant changes in tariffs. This economic tumult is bringing the stormy currents of the labor market to the surface.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the face of these challenges, many job seekers are turning to new AI-powered apps meant to help them find jobs. But ironically, these tools are likely to exacerbate the present challenges and make it harder, not easier, to find jobs. To understand why AI tools designed to help individuals apply to jobs will make the job market more challenging to navigate, it helps to understand the history of those tools and how companies actually hire people today. AI isn’t a new phenomenon in the job-application process. Its mainstream use began on the employer side when companies deployed AI-powered tools in the 2010s to filter through the hundreds of job applications they were receiving for open online job postings. The AI tools baked into these applicant tracking systems—software that companies use to manage the hiring process—looked for matches between the words on incoming resumes and those in job descriptions. If there was enough of a match, then a job seeker’s resume likely made it through the filter.\n\nOn its face, this seemed to offer an advantage to companies over job seekers. In reality, although companies did use these tools to winnow their hiring funnels, most actual hires weren’t made from the pool of people applying online without a connection to the hiring manager. Instead, despite the democratization of job postings online, estimates suggest that well over half of jobs—and perhaps as high as 85%—are still found through personal connections. This is due in no small part to a lack of trust that job seekers and companies have in each other when interacting online. Online job descriptions today have become a long list of skills, qualifications, and platitudes about work style and culture cribbed from past job descriptions, competitors’ postings, and requirements for pay and title grading at the desired level of the role. They have become so vague and meaningless that roles can be impossible to fill as described. Think of the myriad entry-level postings that call for “two years of experience,” for example. Or all the job descriptions that require college degrees—even when current employees in the same roles lack them. Indeed, if you peruse enough job postings, you sometimes get the feeling that employers are seeking employees who do not exist.\n\nSimultaneously, as AI-powered applicant tracking systems sort out individuals that don’t match the desired skills, experiences, and characteristics listed in these job descriptions, prospective employees have learned to embellish their resume and make themselves look like superheroes. In order to get past AI-powered gatekeepers, it has become common for applicants to exaggerate their experiences. This cycle has generated mistrust in the resumes and cover letters coming in from the internet. As a result, managers often prefer to source candidates through a referral they can trust from someone they know. Sure, that might mean it takes longer to fill open roles. But the delay can be worth it from a company’s perspective if it results in a better match. The consequence of this dynamic is that as job seekers begin using AI tools to apply to jobs online, it’s unlikely to help them. It’s actually likely to send the job market into an AI-driven hiring doom loop—the result of which will be employers relying on their personal networks for hiring even more.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Canva, 45% of global job seekers use AI to create and fine-tune their resumes and cover letters. And a growing number of job seekers are doing something more radical: They are using AI-powered tools like LazyApply and JobCopilot to apply directly to open jobs on their behalf. But unfortunately, positive experiences with these AI-powered apps tend to be the exception, not the rule. As more job seekers leverage these automated application tools, it may become even more difficult for job seekers to find a job online because they will flood hiring managers with more applications than they could ever consider. Employers that were receiving hundreds of applications for open roles already tell us that they now receive thousands. With even less trust in the AI-tailored resumes pouring in, companies are likely to rely on personal connections even more to help them find employees.\n\nHiring processes that overly rely on personal connections creates problems—both for companies and job seekers. Companies seeking to boost the diversity of their funnel by gathering large numbers of applicants will likely continue to end up with new hires in similar social circles as their existing employees. Network-based hiring has downsides for job seekers as well. If getting a job is all about who you know, those with limited networks are often left out. As Harvard University’s Raj Chetty’s Opportunity Insights research has shown, networks are strongly based in class—particularly at the top. This means that individuals from low socio-economic backgrounds often have significantly fewer high-income connections. And given the number of jobs filled by who you know, that means that low-income Americans are less connected to higher paying opportunities in the workforce. If these personal connections become even more important when looking for a job, individuals must beef up their networks—not just on social media or with AI bots, but in real life.\n\nTo be sure, networking can “feel dirty,” but as AI makes the job search process more difficult, it will be increasingly critical. So what to do? Rather than connecting with a potential member of your network with the explicit goal of asking for a job, make a habit of being curious about the work other professionals do. Talk with people who hold roles that interest you to learn about what they do on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis. The focus, in other words, should be about learning and growth. Over time, you will expand your network and learn about the roles that are good fits for you, your unique skills and experience, and the types of work that energize you. The goal should be to become a self-aware individual who understands what opportunities are out there, recognizes what they bring to the table, and demonstrates real interest in others. That will, in turn, set you apart as someone worth recommending by those that others trust—which is something AI can’t do.\n\nMichael B.

        "title": "A Texas Bill Claims to Clarify Near-Total Abortion Bans. Advocates Say It Won’t",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Texas has one of the strictest abortion restrictions in the country, banning abortion in nearly all situations with very limited exceptions. Since the near-total ban went into effect, several women in the state have shared stories and filed lawsuits, saying that they were denied critical care while experiencing pregnancy complications. On March 14, one of the lawmakers behind the state’s restrictive abortion laws introduced a bill seeking to clarify medical exceptions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut some abortion-rights advocates and legal experts say the bill won’t do what it claims to, and even worry that it could open the door to prosecuting pregnant people and people who help patients access abortions. Here’s what to know. What is current Texas law? The only exception to Texas’ abortion ban is if a person is experiencing a “life-threatening” medical emergency “that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” But the current version of the law does not get more specific than that. Doctors have said that the near-total ban causes confusion over when they can provide treatment in urgent situations, leading to care delays or denials. However, there is specificity over the potential severe penalties for doctors who are found to have violated the state’s ban: up to $100,000 in fines, 99 years in prison, and losing their medical license.\n\nIn the fall of 2024, ProPublica reported that three Texas women died after they didn’t receive appropriate care while experiencing miscarriages. What is the new proposed bill, SB 31? Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes—who has previously said that exceptions to the state’s near-total ban are “plenty clear”—said during a Senate committee hearing on March 27 that there have been “reports that some doctors and some hospitals are not following the law,” meaning that they have denied necessary medical care. He said he recently introduced a bill, SB 31, in order to “remove any excuse from a doctor or a hospital” from treating a patient experiencing medical emergencies. Republican Texas Rep. Charlie Geren has filed the same bill in the House. (Neither Hughes’s nor Geren’s office responded to a request for comment on this story.) Read More: What Are Abortion Shield Laws? The bill doesn’t expand abortion access in the state, but removes language from the state’s laws that requires a pregnant person to be experiencing a “life-threatening” condition for a doctor to provide care. The bill adds that it “does not require a physician to delay, alter or withhold medical treatment provided to a pregnant female if doing so would create a greater risk of the pregnant female’s death; or substantial impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant female.” It says that a patient’s emergency “need not be imminent or irreversible” for a doctor to provide care. It specifies that ectopic pregnancies are considered exceptions to the state’s near-total abortion ban, but doesn’t include exceptions for fetal anomalies, rape, or incest.\n\nThe bill also includes language that instructs the State Bar of Texas and the Texas Medical Board to hold education sessions for lawyers and doctors about the medical exceptions to the state’s ban. Why is it controversial? The bill has received some rare bipartisan support, as well as support from both anti-abortion groups and some medical organizations, including the Texas Medical Association. Dr. Julie Ayala, an ob-gyn who practices in Texas, testified during the Senate committee hearing on March 27 on behalf of the Texas Medical Association that she believes “this bill will clear up confusion” and “save women’s lives.” But other abortion rights advocates, doctors, and legal experts say the bill won’t do what it claims. “It’s an attempt to add some clarity, but I think the underlying reasons that we’re seeing what we’re seeing with denials to care aren’t really changed in the bill,” says Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law with expertise in abortion. While the bill specifies some situations in which abortion is permitted, “pregnancy is complicated, so there are a lot of other scenarios that aren’t going to be enumerated in the bill where physicians aren’t going to know what to do,” Ziegler says.\n\nThe bill also doesn’t remove the severe penalties for doctors who are found to have violated the state’s near-total ban—one of the reasons “we’re seeing physicians refuse to provide care,” Ziegler says. Read More: IVF Patients Say a Test Caused Them to Discard Embryos. Now They’re Suing Samantha Casiano, an advocate for the reproductive rights advocacy nonprofit Free & Just, also criticized the bill. Casiano, who lives in Texas, was forced to carry her baby to term even after doctors told her at 20 weeks of pregnancy that her baby had anencephaly, a fatal birth defect, and wouldn’t survive. Her baby died four hours after being born. Casiano was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit Zurawski v. State of Texas that was brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights and made national headlines for challenging Texas’ abortion ban. The Texas Supreme Court ruled against the women at the heart of the lawsuit in May 2024, refusing to clarify the exceptions to the state’s abortion ban.\n\n“Nothing in [SB 31] would’ve helped my situation at all,” Casiano says. “I’m just so upset that I felt like from 20 weeks to 32 weeks, I was basically a walking coffin for my daughter until I had to give birth, and then she had to suffer and be in agony. So where in that [bill] does that help my situation, or families and mothers like me? It was really upsetting and disappointing to read it.”\n\nSamantha Casiano (C) speaks during a press conference outside the Travis County Courthouse on July 19, 2023 in Austin, Texas. Suzanne Cordeiro—AFP/Getty Images\n\nDr. Austin Dennard is an ob-gyn practicing in Texas who joined the Zurawski v. State of Texas lawsuit after she was forced to travel out of state to receive care when she learned that her baby had anencephaly. Dennard says that while she believes some of the people behind the bill had good intentions, she doesn’t think the bill “is going to make a lick of difference in the real practicality of practicing medicine.” She says the bill’s language is still very confusing, even to reproductive rights lawyers she’s spoken with, adding that “exceptions don’t work” to ensure access to care.\n\nAs for the education sessions about the medical exceptions, Dennard questions who would be creating that guidance, and if it would be coming from anti-abortion sources. “It’s extremely disappointing to me, and if anyone is celebrating, I think that they are extremely naive to think that these individuals actually really want to make a change,” says Dennard, who is an advocate for Free & Just. “It feels like a political publicity movement rather than [a] true desire to help people.” A cracked-open “door” to further restrictions Advocates and experts also point out that SB 31 amends a 1925 law predating Roe v. Wade. The 1925 law bans abortion and penalizes anyone who “furnishes the means for procuring an abortion,” with the possibility of up to five years in prison. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had previously tried to enforce the 1925 law after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe, but a federal judge blocked the move in 2023. Now, advocates and experts worry that the bill could “open the door” to the 1925 law being used to prosecute abortion patients, as well as people and groups who help patients access care, such as through abortion funds.\n\n“If there is even a sliver of [a] chance that that bill could open the door to that 1925 criminalization of women and people that help you get an abortion, we have to be concerned,” says Kaitlyn Kash, a Free & Just advocate. Kash was forced to travel out of Texas to receive an abortion after learning that her baby had severe skeletal dysplasia, which impacts bone and cartilage growth, and that her baby likely wouldn’t survive. Texas is also considering a separate bill that would allow authorities to charge people who obtain abortions with homicide, making it one of at least 10 states that have introduced bills for the 2025 legislative session that open the door for penalizing patients—a growing trend since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe. Read More: Some States Consider Bills That Would Punish People Seeking Abortions According to Ziegler, SB 31 carves out some situations that wouldn’t be considered “aiding and abetting” an abortion, but in doing so, leaves open the possibility that other situations would be. “It’s sort of a similar dynamic to what you see with the exceptions,” Ziegler says. “There’s some clarity in a few narrow situations, and then a lot of gray area and threat of prosecution in most others.” She adds that Hughes has also introduced another bill, SB 2880, which—among other attempts to crack down on abortion—would expand who could be penalized for “aiding and abetting” abortions, including people who pay for or reimburse the costs associated with obtaining an abortion.\n\nAmanda Zurawski, the lead plaintiff in the Zurawski v. State of Texas lawsuit, was denied an abortion after experiencing a complication called preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes (PPROM) because doctors said they detected fetal cardiac activity. A few days later, she developed sepsis, a life-threatening condition. Doctors performed an emergency induction abortion, and she had to spend several days in the ICU. Zurawski, now a Free & Just advocate, criticized SB 31 for attempting to create “blanket rules over every single pregnancy in the state of Texas, because no two are the same.” “I like to believe—I think I have to believe—that the intent of this bill is not malicious,” she says, but she adds that Texas officials have attempted to penalize people providing access to abortion care. The Texas Attorney General’s office recently announced that it had filed criminal charges against a midwife and medical assistant, accusing them of illegally providing abortions in Texas.\n\nDennard says she has received pressure from some people behind the bill and other physicians who disagree with her to support it. While some doctors and legal experts have said that the clarity would make “modest but not meaningless” changes and could save some lives, advocates say they don’t believe it will work.\n\n“We shouldn’t be begging for scraps,” Kash says.”You don’t legislate medicine.”",

        "content": "What a difference mere weeks have made in Canada. As the new year came and went, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his ruling Liberal Party, after nearly a decade in power, were trailing the Conservatives by 25 points—and facing electoral oblivion. An election was due by fall. It was looking like it might come earlier. The opposition parties in the House of Commons were working to bring down the government. Today, Canada is in the midst of that early election, but the circumstances are night and day. Trudeau is gone, replaced by former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. And it was Carney himself who called a snap election for April 28. Most surprising of all, the Liberals are back up in the polls—and now favored to win. And it’s all thanks to a brash American in the Oval Office.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe last three months have embodied the old maxim that “events, dear boy, events” can upset the odds in short order. After Donald Trump was elected in November, Canadians became nervous about what his second term might mean for the country. That it wouldn’t be anything good was obvious as early as December when Trump bullied Trudeau, vowed sweeping tariffs, and even threatened annexation to make Canada the “cherished 51st state.” With Trump’s taunts, the pressure on the highly unpopular Trudeau to step aside only grew. Canada needed a new, full-time and focused leader, with plenty of runway to deal with Trump and his bid for hemispheric dominance. So Trudeau announced his resignation on Jan. 6, the date Trump’s win was certified. A short Liberal leadership race followed in March, and Carney became Prime Minister. On Sunday, he called a snap election as voters are rallying around the flag and the incumbent Liberals, and against the Yankee menace.\n\nWith Canada’s economy, defense, and even sovereignty on the line, it’s no surprise that the election is about Trump and who can best handle him—and how. But it’s still a shock to witness the ultra-rapid revival of a Liberal Party that was written off as moribund not so long ago.\n\nIf the Liberals do indeed survive and hold on to power come April 28, they will have Trump to thank—but they’ll also have him to deal with.",

        "title": "Percival Everett Is Challenging the American Literary Canon",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\n\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\n\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\n\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\n\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\n\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\n\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\n\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Cybertrucks set on fire. Bomb threats at Tesla showrooms. Vandalism at charging stations. A wave of violent protests targeting Tesla facilities has erupted across the country in recent weeks over Elon Musk’s controversial role within the Trump Administration, with demonstrators looking to bankrupt the company and ultimately force Musk out of his government position. On Saturday, March 29, the anti-Musk movement is preparing for what could be its largest mobilization yet. The decentralized group Tesla Takedown has called for peaceful protests targeting more than 500 locations worldwide in what organizers describe as a stand against its billionaire CEO’s involvement with right-wing politics. Musk, who serves as the head of the newly-established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), alienated many customers when he endorsed Trump in last year’s presidential election and spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help his campaign, including by leveraging his social media platform X to rally support.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSince January, Musk’s public persona has only become more divisive, as he’s overseen aggressive cuts to the federal workforce, called for privatizing popular government programs, and made what was widely interpreted as a Nazi-style salute at a celebration rally on the day of Trump’s Inauguration. Many also view his close ties to the Trump Administration as a clear conflict of interest, given that his businesses have collected a reported $38 billion in government funds. While Tesla Takedown insists its movement is nonviolent, critics have tried in recent weeks to blame it for acts of vandalism and arson against Tesla showrooms, vehicles, and charging stations. Incidents have ranged from Molotov cocktail attacks in Salem, Oregon, to Cybertrucks spray-painted with Nazi comparisons in Brooklyn. Federal authorities have already arrested multiple suspects, with both Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi branding the destruction of Tesla property as “domestic terrorism” and warning that those involved could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\n“You didn’t have that on Jan. 6, I can tell you,” Trump said last week, suggesting that the Tesla attacks were more destructive than the deadly January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, when hundreds of his supporters stormed the building in an effort to overturn the election and left the halls of Congress with broken windows, vandalized walls and ransacked offices. “Nobody was killed on January 6, but what’s happening to Elon Musk and Tesla is a disgrace.” Since December, Tesla’s stock has lost more than half its value. Trump has portrayed Musk as a patriot under siege and earlier this month made a show of buying a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House. “I think [Musk has] been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people. And I just want people to know that he can’t be penalized for being a patriot,” Trump said of Musk’s role in his Administration. The President promised that protesters who had attacked Tesla dealerships and charging stations were “going to go through hell.”\n\n“I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20-year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, even suggesting that convicted vandals should serve their time in El Salvador’s notorious prison system, which has already become a black hole for accused Venezuelan gang members deported from United States with no judicial hearing. Despite the increased pressure from the Trump Administration, protesters are still planning for their “biggest day of action” at all 277 Tesla showrooms on March 29. “Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he's using the fortune he built at Tesla to do it. We are taking action at Tesla to stop Musk's illegal coup,” Tesla Takedown says on its website, adding that “we oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property.” Once seen as the epitome of innovation and progress, Musk’s Tesla is now viewed as a symbol of division. Some disillusioned owners have responded to calls from Tesla Takedown to sell their vehicles, including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat. Others have placed anti-Musk bumper stickers on their Teslas in protest, while some conservative personalities, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, have publicized their recent purchases of new Teslas.\n\nSome analysts speculate that Tesla’s board may eventually have to distance itself from Musk if public relations woes continue to drag down the company’s financial performance. An NBC News poll released this month found that more voters (51%) viewed Musk negatively than positively (39%), reflecting how deeply polarized public opinion of the billionaire CEO has become in the wake of his work with Trump. Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on the backlash against Musk to energize their base. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas said at a virtual rally held for the Tesla Takedown movement that she hoped to see Musk “taken down” on her birthday on March 29, the day of the planned protests. She clarified during the rally that her calls for action were nonviolent. Bondi, the attorney general, warned Crockett to “tread very carefully” in response. As tensions escalate, some protesters say they are now facing personal threats and harassment. Joan Donovan, one of the organizers of the Tesla Takedown movement, said in a post on Bluesky that she is being “viciously threatened and doxed” for participating in the public demonstrations, claiming that Musk’s supporters had developed “a private army of networked harassers” who have branded her a “domestic terrorist” for protesting Tesla. And in Florida last Saturday, a man was arrested after driving his car toward a group of anti-Musk protesters outside a Tesla dealership in West Palm Beach. No one was injured.\n\nThe FBI has warned the public to look out for signs of possible attacks on Tesla properties ahead of the day of action, including individuals surveilling or trying to break into dealerships or making threats against the company online.\n\n“Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks,” Musk wrote on X in response to the violent acts aimed at Tesla facilities.",

        "title": "Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The U.S. intelligence community published its 2025 annual threat assessment on March 25. Missing from the document was any mention of climate change—marking the first time in over a decade that the topic has not appeared on the list. \"What I focused this annual threat assessment on, and the [Intelligence Committee] focused this threat assessment on, are the most extreme and critical direct threats to our national security,\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in response to questioning on the removal during a Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGabbard said she “didn’t recall” instructing the intelligence community to avoid mentioning climate change in the report. But the change comes amid the Trump Administration’s continued push for a deprioritization of climate change in the federal agenda. Read more: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action The U.S. government has considered climate change a global security threat for at least three decades. Academic reports at the Naval War College included environmental stressors and climate change in the 1980s, says Mark Nevitt, associate professor of law at Emory University. On the federal level, climate change was first acknowledged as a national security threat by President George W. Bush in August 1991, and the U.S. national security community first listed the issue as a threat in 2008. The issue has typically been included on the annual threat assessment list because of its destabilizing impact—both domestically and abroad. “The annual threat assessment is projecting forward about where the areas of concern and the areas of competition [are], and where the U.S. national security sector should be focusing its attention,” says Nevitt. “Because climate change is just destabilizing different parts of the world, through extreme weather, through droughts, through sea level rise…the intelligence community wants to be ready for future conflicts and future areas of competition.”\n\nClimate change is often referred to as a “threat multiplier” by the intelligence community, because it aggravates already existing problems, while also creating new ones. “It takes things that we were already worried about, like extremism or terrorism, and exacerbates the scale or nature of those threats,” says Scott Moore, practice professor of political science, with a focus on climate and security, at the University of Pennsylvania. “If you have these intensified climate change impacts, they place stress on things like food systems, and worsen already existing tensions within countries.” Climate migration, for example, is on the rise around the world—more than half of new internal displacements within countries registered in 2023 were caused by weather related disasters, according to the Migration Data Portal. “Mass migration leads to a lot of political and social tensions as well as border issues,” says Karen Seto, professor of geography and urbanization science at the Yale School of the Environment. “That … could affect national security, because it could destabilize an entire region.” One study from the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that extreme weather is contributing to migration into the United States through the southern border—with more migrants from agricultural regions in Mexico settling in the United States following extreme drought.\n\nSuch displacement can have major impacts on people's lives and livelihoods, experts say—especially in already fragile regions. “If you have, for example, a really extreme and intensified drought in a country in which extremist ideologies are percolating, these climate change impacts may make it more likely that people are going to stop farming, or might migrate to cities where they may face difficult employment prospects, be socially dislocated and may be more vulnerable to extremism or engaging in some type of violence,” says Moore. On a domestic level, considering climate change helps the U.S. military ensure that infrastructure is built to withstand extreme weather events—and respond to national disasters both domestically and abroad. “You need the National Guard, the Coast Guard, the U.S. military, to basically help out their community when there's an extreme weather event,” says Nevitt. As extreme weather events intensify with climate change this could strain military resources and put more lives at risk if the military does not prepare to address the threat.\n\nInfrastructure within the U.S., like energy and internet grids, also need to be fortified. If regions were to lose power in the case of an extreme weather event, the networks could be vulnerable to attack. “Our energy grid is highly at risk, and we've seen wildfires happening across the country, and so these could again be threat multipliers,\" says Seto. “I think the national security risk is that we are not ready to respond to any threats from foreign agents that may take advantage of the weaknesses that we might have.” Showing that the climate crisis is a priority is also necessary to maintain the United States’s diplomatic strength—especially in regions that see climate change as a top concern. “Other countries, in particular countries that are very significant for the U.S. defense posture, like the Pacific Island countries, really care about climate change a lot. They want to hear what the United States is willing to do to help them deal with climate change,” says Moore. “And so when you have the instructions to essentially ignore climate change, or in an extreme version almost censor mention of climate change, that's going to have a harmful effect on diplomatic engagement with some pretty important countries.”\n\nAnd experts say that removing climate change from the list—and deprioritizing the issue writ large—is only going to leave the U.S. more vulnerable. “This is going to make the administration and national security sector less nimble, because they might not have the people, the plans, the policy, [and] capacity in place when disaster inevitably strikes,” warns Nevitt. “You can't just wish climate change away.”",

        "title": "The Rising Demand For Electricity Is About More than AI",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "How much will AI drive up power demand in the next few years? That’s been the big question at the center of the energy and climate conversation recently. Many analysts have warned that AI-driven electricity usage is expected to more than double in the next five years as consumers and businesses find varied applications for the technology. But others urge caution: not all data centers in the planning process will ultimately be built and AI could become much more energy efficient than it is today.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is a crucial debate—but the full picture is even more complicated. Even if AI guzzles less energy than the zeitgeist suggests, a wide range of electricity demand drivers lurk just around the corner. A report released earlier this week from the International Energy Agency (IEA) gives a sense of the picture: global electricity demand grew by 4.3% last year due to a range of causes that include not just data centers but also electrification of everything from building heating to cooking, along with more air conditioning thanks to record high temperatures, among other things. “We see one very clear trend: electricity growth,” says Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. Widening the aperture of the conversation around future power demand can help prevent us from fixating on a single technology (however transformative it might be), and avoid the risk of overlooking the complex interplay of factors that will shape our energy future—and the challenges and opportunities that will arise from it.\n\nTo understand the nature of electricity demand growth, it’s helpful to break it down by geography. And there’s no better place to start than in emerging markets and developing countries. Electricity demand ticked up 7% in China and by more than 4% in other emerging and developing economies; meanwhile, electricity consumption in the European Union grew by about 1.5%, according to the IEA. Some of that growth is the simple product of expanding economies. More wealth means more electricity use. But a significant portion of the rising demand came from high temperatures—particularly heat waves in India and China—that pushed consumers and businesses to crank up air conditioning. Electricity usage also grew in the U.S. by about 2% last year, according to government data. Unsurprisingly, the most significant source of that growth was new data centers, but other factors contributed, too. Federal programs enacted during the Biden Administration, like the Inflation Reduction Act, have helped boost the country’s advanced manufacturing footprint. That means a wave of new facilities drawing electricity in previously unoccupied land or revitalized vacant facilities. Moreover, today’s manufacturing plants rely more on electricity than they would have a generation ago, when they might have onsite power from fossil fuels.\n\nAnd then there are electric vehicles. Headlines would have you believe that EVs now face an insurmountable challenge in the U.S. market as people aren’t buying as many as expected. That may be true, but the IEA reports that sales actually continued to grow in the U.S. at greater than a 10% clip. In the coming years, increased EV penetration inevitably means greater power demand. There are a few lessons to draw from this story. For one, if you’re betting on an AI-efficiency breakthrough to save the world from an electricity crunch, you’re missing the bigger picture. Yes, we know a range of developments, like more energy efficient language models, could reduce AI’s future electricity demand, but that won’t address all of the other sources of demand. There are also some positive elements that emerge from this story. Most obviously, the IEA says that 80% of new electricity generation globally last year came from renewable energy or nuclear power. That dynamic means that emissions grew at a slower pace than the economy. “If we want to find the silver lining, we see that there is a continuous decoupling of economic growth from emissions growth,” says Birol.\n\nThat’s small consolation at a time when emissions need to not just slow down but actually decline in order to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change. But I see another opportunity that could emerge from this imminent power crunch: we may be forced to finally confront the full range of solutions available to us. Yes, power companies are eagerly trying to build natural gas to meet demand. But they’re building solar power and battery storage, too. And because neither will be enough, companies have rediscovered the value of nuclear power. In these circumstances, demand-reducing technologies like smart grids and demand response are already taking on newfound importance and companies are incentivized to find more energy efficient ways to run their business. That importance should only grow.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.",

This year marks TIME’s third annual Earth Awards, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. In 2024, the planet breached 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures, an ominous milestone—and a reminder of the urgency with which the world must tackle this challenge. And although climate action faces headwinds from the rising tide of populist politics around the world, this year’s group of honorees remain steadfast in championing sustainability and shaping a greener future.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere is the Environmental justice leader Catherine Coleman Flowers, who has a legacy of advocating for marginalized communities, particularly Black and rural families affected by untreated sewage. She has gone on to work with Democrats and Republicans alike in an effort to bring about lasting change. Alongside, we honor Jay Inslee, the Governor of Washington from 2013 to 2025, and a leader in local climate action. As co-founder of the U.S. Climate Alliance he has brought together two dozen states to drive progress towards a clean economy. There is former New York Mayor and U.N. Special Envoy Michael Bloomberg, who is steadfastly dedicated to supporting innovative solutions. In January, when President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Bloomberg Philanthropies stepped up to coordinate an effort to continue funding the nation’s climate goals. In Ghana, chef Selassie Atadika, the founder of Midunu—an experiential restaurant that highlights the region’s culinary heritage—and Midunu Chocolates, uses her food to advocate for sustainable agriculture and showcase the power of the African kitchen. In 2024 she was announced as Yale's inaugural Global Table Fellow in an effort to highlight the connection between sustainability, health, and culture.\n\nBack in the U.S., Former Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Frist is calling for climate change to be recognized as a public health crisis. He serves as the global chair of The Nature Conservancy which last year launched the Senator Bill and Tracy Frist Initiative for Planetary Health.\n\nAnd actor Rainn Wilson is on a mission to better communicate the urgency of the climate crisis. With that goal in mind, in 2022 he co-founded Climate Basecamp, an organization that brings scientists and trendsetters together to make talking about the reality of climate change more accessible.\n\nBuy a copy of the Earth Awards 2025 issue here",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "MADISON, Wis. — Billionaire Elon Musk on Friday deleted a social media post in which he had announced plans to hold a rally in Wisconsin to “personally hand over” $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the state’s hotly contested Supreme Court race. Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election that will determine ideological control of the court in the battleground state. The action was announced despite a Wisconsin law that explicitly prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for a vote.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMusk said that attendance at his talk would be limited only to those who have voted in the Supreme Court election, without explaining how he would verify that. “I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,” Musk posted. “This is super important.” He didn't say how the two people were chosen. Read More: Who Is Judge James Boasberg and Why Trump Wants Him Impeached The Supreme Court race has shattered previous spending records for a U.S. judicial election and has become a referendum on Musk and the first months of President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump, a Republican, endorsed Brad Schimel and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night. “It’s a very important race,” Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel’s campaign. “I know you feel it’s local, but it’s not. It’s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.”\n\nSchimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday’s election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play. Musk earlier this week said he had awarded a voter in Green Bay $1 million for signing a petition his political action committee created targeting activist judges. Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether that person was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million as initially indicated on Sunday. Romeo did not immediately respond to a message asking why Musk's post was deleted. Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.\n\nThat raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote. Any legal challenge to Musk’s payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition. The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery. Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment. Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.\n\n“I, frankly, thought, ‘Should I sign that petition? I’m against activist judges, but I don’t think I should do that,’” Schimel said. When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, “I don’t know what the criteria to get it was.” Crawford’s campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a “last-minute desperate distraction.” “Wisconsinites don’t want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk’s lackey Brad Schimel,” he said. Musk’s political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. During last year’s presidential race, Philadelphia’s district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.\n\nMusk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million. Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state. Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices. The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.\n\nMore than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti liked automobiles, particularly his four-cylinder Fiat sports car. For him, the car represented innovation and vitality, even violence. Most of all, it signified the future. An Italian poet, performer, and pamphleteer, Marinetti was a reactionary; he loathed egalitarianism and democracy. He also wasn’t a conservative in any traditional sense, for there was little that he, and others in the Futurist art movement that he founded, wished to conserve. In his 1909 treatise, Founding and Manifesto of Futurism, he wrote, “We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind.” A precursor to the fascism that would envelop Europe, Marinetti was an influence on Benito Mussolini, and that ideology, which would soon fulfill that dark promise of destroying Europe’s museums, libraries, and academies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMarinetti’s stronghold over Mussolini has striking parallels to America today—particularly with the rise of the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and its most vocal steward: software engineer and blogger Curtis Yarvin. Largely ignored by academic philosophers, the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and Yarvin have curried favor and influence with tech executives in recent years. A software engineer by training, Yarvin has become a kind of official philosopher for tech leaders like PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel and Mosaic founder Marc Andreessen. Not unlike the Futurists, Yarvin advocates for replacing democracy with a kind of techno-feudal state—for the government to be run like a corporation, with the president as its “CEO.” This new system is elitist—“humans fit into dominance-submission structures” Yarvin wrote in 2008; and it’s authoritarian—“If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia,” he said in 2012. There are shades of Yarvin’s philosophy in Thiel’s 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, where he wrote “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” And Thiel, through his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, was an early investor in the blogger’s startup company Urbit. As for Yarvin’s controversial opinions and whether or not Thiel holds them, Yarvin has said that his patron is “fully enlightened,” as he had been “coaching Thiel.” What’s more, in a recent interview with the Hoover Institution, Andreessen quoted Yarvin and called him a “friend.”\n\nWhat’s even more alarming is that Yarvin’s outsize influence on tech executives has now made its way to Washington. The signs are everywhere: Yarvin was a feted guest at Trump’s so-called “Coronation Ball” in January 2025. Vice President J.D. Vance, a protegee of Thiel’s, spoke admiringly of the blogger’s influence on his thinking when interviewed on a podcast in July 2024. And while Andreessen’s role in the Trump White House is unofficial, The Washington Post reported in January 2025 that the executive “has been quietly and successfully recruiting candidates for positions across Trump’s Washington.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, though not outwardly tipping his hat to Yarvin, seemingly has a similar philosophy: In 2020, Musk told the Wall Street Journal that the “government is simply the largest corporation.” Five years later, Musk has been using his position as an unofficial advisor to the second Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to operationalize what Yarvin has called “a hard reboot” of the government.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington As such, it behooves us to be more familiar with Yarvin and other associated figureheads of this far-right philosophy. Understanding their motivations is essential to understanding what the stakes currently are—and how history can repeat itself. Much can be gleaned about the attractions of this ideology to many of those in power from simply parsing the name of the movement. “Dark Enlightenment” portends the upending of the liberal order that has defined democratic aspirations for nearly three centuries. Where the Enlightenment promised liberty, emancipation, equality, and solidarity, “Dark Enlightenment” offers servitude, hierarchy, bondage, and ruthlessness. The movement is most often associated with the British philosopher Nick Land. Land was a founder of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom until 1995 when his own increasingly erratic behavior had him expelled. Land is actively anti-democratic, desiring a system where great men (guided by algorithms and artificial intelligence) steer the ship of state. This is an explicitly nihilistic vision—“Nothing human makes it out of the near-future,” wrote Land in 1994—an ideology combining technological utopianism with deep misanthropy, a variant of what the historian Jeffrey Herf described as “reactionary modernism,” but which we might as well call cybernetic authoritarianism or technological fascism.\n\nThis leads us to Yarvin. A polemical blogger, Yarvin wrote for years under the goofy name “Mencius Moldbug” where he advocated for his own form of techno-authoritarianism in opposition to democracy. Like Marinetti, Yarvin expressed disdain for those symbols of American culture that he sees as oppositional to “Dark Enlightenment”—from free voting to free inquiry, a vibrant media to the open university. Yarvin, writing in 2021, posited (with significantly less poetry than the Futurists), “Because the university is the heart of the old regime, it is absolutely essential to the success of any regime change that all accredited universities be both physically and economically liquidated.” Yarvin speaks disparagingly of something that he calls “The Cathedral,” a nexus of educational, media, and nonprofit organizations that he believes sets the tenor for discourse, but that also impedes the liberty of executives to do what they will. Rather his aspiration is, as he wrote in 2007, that “the state is simply a real estate business on a very large scale.”\n\nUsing a variety of mixed metaphors, Yarvin advocates for a “Butterfly Revolution,” a “full power start” to the U.S. government accomplished by “giving absolute sovereignty to a single organization.\" This is imagined as an internal coup meant to privatize the government and replace democracy with complete executive authority. Two years ago, Yarvin laid out his strategic program with the acronym “RAGE,” or “Retire all government employees.” Yarvin argued that a hypothetical future Trump administration should terminate all nonpolitical federal workers to have them be replaced by loyalists. The government’s coffers must then be impounded and redirected, according to the blogger. When courts prevent unconstitutional orders, Yarvin says that they should just be ignored. After that, the free press and universities must be curtailed, as well—Yarvin said no later than April after the inauguration.\n\nThat so much of this seems to mirror the actions of the Trump administration and DOGE may not be a coincidence. So far, some 30,000 federal employees—across departments as varied as the FDA, the National Park Service, and the FAA—have been fired by DOGE in the name of government efficiency. Yarvin’s musings in 2009 that the “definition of a sovereign is that a sovereign is above the law,” hold a mirror to Trump’s February tweet that “He who save his country, violates no law.”\n\nYarvin’s claim that “No brand or building can survive” is perfectly congruent with the tech industry’s notorious ethos to “Move fast and break things.” But what’s also being seemingly witnessed is a harbinger of the “monarchism” that Yarvin desires. On February 19, Trump posted a doctored image of himself in a crown with the caption “Long Live the King!” on his social media app Truth Social.\n\nAs is so often the case with Trump, pundits have a tendency to assume a lack of seriousness or intention with what the president says. The same dismissiveness sometimes accompanied the Futurists, and Mussolini’s fascists for that matter, when they were ascendant. Now, as Trump threatens longtime American allies from Panama to Mexico, Canada to Denmark, a belief of the Futurists even more disturbing than their worship of technology should be remembered: Marinetti’s claim that “War is the hygiene of the world.”",

        "title": "Pat Ryan Interview: Why Democrats Need 'Patriotic Populism'",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Rep. Pat Ryan was one of the first members of the House to call on President Joe Biden to step aside last year, so he's no stranger to delivering a tough message. A West Point alum and combat veteran, Ryan, 43, won his seat in New York's Hudson Valley in 2022, then outran Kamala Harris by double digits in his district last fall in a race Republicans contested aggressively. In an interview with TIME, Ryan discussed the Democrats' \"flawed\" brand, the problem with Biden's student loan-forgiveness program, and why the party's affordability crisis and masculinity crisis are actually the same thing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Why did the Democrats do so badly and what needs to change? If I had to distill it: we lost touch with the people, particularly working-class and middle-class people, the core of America. Democrats were seen as defending the status quo, where people are getting screwed over and [under] tremendous economic pressure, and Democrats were seen as having no plan to address it. Whereas Trump was very focused on echoing back the pain people are feeling. It is a populist moment right now, because of the near-unprecedented economic inequality that's been created for multiple decades now, my entire lifetime. And Trump has answered that populist moment with a destructive populism. The opportunity and the need for Democrats is to answer with a constructive populism, a patriotic populism. We have to call out villains. The villains are greedy corporations. The villains are corrupt government leaders. And the heroes are the American people. That's the part we have to focus on. A patriotic call to actually fighting for the people, rather than all these elite entities that are really a lot of the root causes why people are feeling economic pain.\n\nSo is there a core policy issue, or policy solution, that you think Democrats are not running on that they should be? Housing affordability is the number one financial stressor for people right now, whether trying to buy a home, which is essentially impossible for anybody our age, unless you're super rich or your parents help you. It's just unsustainable, and neither party is talking about this. But Kamala Harris had a really elaborate housing proposal. She was one of the first presidential candidates to ever put housing at the core of her economic plan. She gave speeches about it, and it didn't seem to land with people. So if that’s such a winning issue, why didn’t it work for her? She had such little time to deliver her entire message. I'm not saying they ran a perfect campaign by any means, but it was really tough in that limited time to break through. I do think we talk in policy wonk and long policy speeches. We don't tell stories and talk to people and tell them: here's the person responsible for why this is currently not working, or the set of people, and here's a path forward that centers you as the hero of the story. And that never came through to me.\n\nIf you had a magic wand and were in charge of the entire Democratic Party, knowing what you know about the Trump voters and swing voters that you represent in your district, how would you remake the party? We’ve got to be listening again. We’ve got to really hear people and what they're dealing with, to then be able to carry that into our policy. The opportunity space is so huge because the entire Republican Party is lined up behind Trump in such a cowardly way, they're not talking to constituents anymore. I mean, they're getting booed at their own town halls in safe districts. To be clear, the Democratic brand right now is deeply flawed, and anybody making a case that we need to nibble around the edges is deluding themselves. The brand is not connecting with enough people, and those numbers are dwindling. You talk to any one front-liner in our party in the House who ran in hard races and over-performed, we had to run against the core brand. That is a strategically unsustainable position, and I don't think we've fully grappled with that.\n\nHow do you fix that brand? It sounds cliche, but how would you fix another brand? You do research; you talk to people. If your customers are telling you, hey, we're not interested, you don't just keep pumping more dollars in your marketing budget. You go back and look at the brand. Why did men drift so far right, and what can Democrats do to win them back? If there's two options and you're only hearing from one option, you're going to pick the one option you're hearing from. And in many places, we just weren't talking to and engaging with men of all demographics. I did a lot of that, whether it's talking to cadets and military leaders at West Point, which is in my district, where we dramatically improved from two years ago. I just think a lot of it was number one, showing up, and then number two, focusing on the issues that we were hearing about, which were largely economic and affordability issues.\n\nI think men and especially younger men take pride in providing for their family. It's incredibly emasculating to feel that you're working your ass off and you can't provide for your family. And you want to know that somebody gets that and feels that and is working to improve that and empower you—not with any handouts, but empower you to have the tools to fix it. So you think that the affordability crisis and the masculinity crisis are basically the same? 100%. I mean, 85%, 90%. I have a huge community in my district of skilled-trades workers. We're giving handouts to people that are in college debt who need help, but it's perceived to be at the expense of working-class people who chose not to go to college. It felt like a double whammy—you know, I'm trying to choose a career that actually will help me provide more quickly, more income to take care of my family, and you're helping people that are going to college instead. I think that was a place where we didn't listen and didn't understand.\n\nWhat do you think needs to change in the culture of the Democratic Party going forward? A lot. One of my pet peeves is sports. I'm obsessed with local sports in particular. I read the local sports section every day. I follow different high-school teams. West Point is the most popular brand in our entire community. People love going to Army football games or hockey or basketball; they love what West Point stands for. I follow all the teams and go to so many games. That allows me to then connect on a non-political level. The moment is not only populist, but it's anti-status quo and anti-establishment and anti-elite. So we need to find ways to connect with people that are not political, like sports. I went to the Army vs. Navy football game. President Trump was there, and got a very loud round of applause, much to my frustration. And I think there were maybe two Democrats there, me and [Maryland Gov.] Wes Moore, that I saw. And there were tons of Republican elected officials.\n\nWhat other cultural shifts need to happen? To me, strong leadership has two components. You have to show you're willing to fight for your people, and you have to show that you're fighting because you care about them. So there's fight and care. I think the current Democratic Party is very heavy on the care, very little on the fight. The current Republican Party under Trump is all fight. And as we're seeing in the first few months here, like zero care—unless you're a multi-billionaire, or someone who's a big Trump donor or sycophant. So the opportunity is that combo of fight and care—what would be traditionally masculine and feminine—and bringing that together authentically. What’s the best way to fight Trump this time around? Thousands of people in my district voted for me and voted for President Trump. I've never pulled my punches in what I think about President Trump. I've called him a traitor, which I still believe that he is. Against most conventional wisdom as a front-liner, I spoke at the DNC and talked about his not being fit to be Commander-in-Chief because of the Honor Code I learned as a cadet.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s about the people and the harm that he is doing to them and the failure to deliver on most of the things he promised to do. He's so good at laying out bait for us to take that's about him or other sort of divisive culture-war type issues. We have to stay ruthlessly focused on the people. I've been very careful to focus on issues that I feel are broadly harmful and will be broadly understood. For example, 20 inpatient beds closed at our VA because of the Trump hiring freeze. A Social Security office in the city of Poughkeepsie closed because of the acting head resigning and all the DOGE things happening. And that's seniors that now can't get the help they need. Those 20 inpatient beds are for detox and mental-health crisis for veterans. We did a rally where I had a bunch of folks, a lot of veterans who I'm pretty sure probably voted for Trump, stood with me and said, ‘This is outrageous. This has to stop’ to demand that we reopen these beds.\n\nWe have to create a place where folks who see that and feel it is un-American and harmful can come, and not feel judged or condescended or lectured at. We have to make a place for patriots who still believe in the founding values of this country but might not yet be ready to be seen as a Democrat.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

        "content": "More than 12,000 acres have burned in North and South Carolina as wildfires continue to rage through the states’ western region. The situation has prompted emergency declarations in both states, and mandatory evacuations have been ordered in several counties. The wildfires come as many continue to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene just six months ago. The category 4 storm killed more than 100 people in North Carolina and over 50 in South Carolina. This week’s blazes were in part fueled by downed timber from the hurricane, coupled with wind and dry conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s how you can help victims and first responders in the Carolinas. Associa Cares Associa Cares was created to help families and communities in the wake of disasters. The organization aims to provide direct financial relief to those impacted and has already earmarked $100,000 to support individuals and families affected by the recent wildfires across North and South Carolina. American Red Cross The American Red Cross has been providing emergency assistance and disaster relief for over a century. The organization has opened an evacuation shelter in South Carolina and is supporting several shelters in North Carolina. While it says it no longer is in need of supplies to help wildfire survivors, the organization is still accepting monetary donations. World Central Kitchen World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit food relief organization founded by celebrity chef José Andrés, is often on the ground providing meals for victims and first responders of disasters around the world. The organization is currently in North Carolina providing meals for first responders.\n\nSouth Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (SCVOAD)\n\nSouth Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, an offshoot of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, is an association of groups that help provide services to communities affected by disaster. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division “ways to help” webpage directs individuals to make monetary donations to SCVOAD, and contact them for volunteer opportunities.\n\nCity of Walhalla Fire Department\n\nThe city of Walhalla's fire department has posted a list of needed items for the 400 first responders combating fires in South Carolina. The department asks that the requested items, which range from eye drops to safety goggles, are delivered by Friday, March 28.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face.\n\nWhen I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point.\n\nAfter her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.”\n\nThe 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If you’re wondering why social media is filled with Studio Ghibli-style memes all of a sudden, there are several answers to that question. The most obvious one is that OpenAI dropped an update to ChatGPT on Tuesday that allows users to generate better images using the 4o version of the model. OpenAI has long proffered image generation tools, but this one felt like a significant evolution: users say it is far better than other AI image-generators at accurately following text prompts, and that it makes much higher fidelity images.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut that’s not the only reason for the deluge of memes in the style of the Japanese animation house. Alongside the ChatGPT update, OpenAI also relaxed several of its rules on the types of images users can generate with its AI tools—a change CEO Sam Altman said “represents a new high-water mark for us in allowing creative freedom.” Among those changes: allowing users to generate images of adult public figures for the first time, and reducing the likelihood that ChatGPT would reject users’ prompts, even if they risked being offensive. “People are going to create some really amazing stuff and some stuff that may offend people,” Altman said in a post on X. “What we'd like to aim for is that the tool doesn't create offensive stuff unless you want it to, in which case within reason it does.” Users quickly began making the most of the policy change — sharing “Ghiblified” images of 9/11, Adolf Hitler, and the murder of George Floyd. The official White House account on X even shared a Studio Ghibli-style image of an ICE officer detaining an alleged illegal immigrant.\n\nIn one sense, the pivot has been a long time coming. OpenAI began its decade-long life as a research lab that kept its tools under strict lock and key; when it did release early chatbots and image generation models, they had strict content filters that aimed to prevent misuse. But for years it has been widening the accessibility of its tools in an approach it calls “iterative deployment.” The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 was the most popular example of this strategy, which the company believes is necessary to help society adapt to the changes AI is bringing. Still, in another sense, the change to OpenAI’s model behavior policies has a more recent proximate cause: the 2024 election of President Donald Trump, and the cultural shift that has accompanied the new administration. Trump and his allies have been highly critical of what they see as the censorship of free speech online by large tech companies. Many conservatives have drawn parallels between the longstanding practice of content moderation on social media and the more recent strategy, by AI companies including OpenAI, to limit the kinds of content that generative AI models are allowed to create. “ChatGPT has woke programmed into its bones,” Elon Musk posted on X in December.\n\nLike most big companies, OpenAI is trying hard to build ties with the Trump White House. The company scored an early win when, on the second day of his presidency, Trump stood beside Altman and announced a large investment into the datacenters that OpenAI believes will be necessary to train the next generation of AI systems. But OpenAI is still in a delicate position. Musk, Trump’s billionaire backer and advisor, has a famous dislike of Altman. The pair cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, but after a failed attempt to become CEO, Musk quit in a huff. He is now suing Altman and OpenAI, claiming that they reneged on OpenAI’s founding mission to develop AI as a non-profit. With Musk operating from the White House and also leading a rival AI company, xAI, it is especially vital for OpenAI’s business prospects to cultivate positive ties where possible with the Trump administration. Earlier in March, OpenAI submitted a document laying out recommendations for the new administration’s tech policy. It was a shift in tone from earlier missives by the company. “OpenAI’s freedom-focused policy proposals, taken together, can strengthen America’s lead on AI and in so doing, unlock economic growth, lock in American competitiveness, and protect our national security,” the document said. It called on the Trump administration to exempt OpenAI, and the rest of the private sector, from 781 state-level laws proposing to regulate AI, which it said “risks bogging down innovation.” In return, OpenAI said, industry could provide the U.S. government with “learnings and access” from AI companies, and would ensure the U.S. retained its “leadership position” ahead of China in the AI race.\n\nAlongside the release of this week’s new ChatGPT update, OpenAI doubled down on what it said were policies intended to give users more freedom, within bounds, to create whatever they want with its AI tools. “We’re shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more precise approach focused on preventing real-world harm,” Joanne Jang, OpenAI’s head of model behavior, said in a blog post. “The goal is to embrace humility: recognizing how much we don't know, and positioning ourselves to adapt as we learn.” Jang gave several examples of things that were previously disallowed, but to which OpenAI was now opening its doors. Tools could now be used to generate images of public figures, Jang wrote, although OpenAI would create an opt-out list allowing people to “decide for themselves” whether they wanted ChatGPT to be able to generate images of them. Children, she wrote, would be subjected to “stronger protections and tighter guardrails.”\n\n“Offensive” content, Jang wrote—using quotation marks—would also receive a rethink under OpenAI’s new policies. Uses that might be seen as offensive by some, but which didn’t cause real-world harm, would be increasingly permitted. “Without clear guidelines, the model previously refused requests like ‘make this person’s eyes look more Asian’ or ‘make this person heavier,’ unintentionally implying these attributes were inherently offensive,” Jang wrote, suggesting that such prompts would be allowed in future. OpenAI’s tools previously flat-out rejected attempts by users to generate hate symbols like swastikas. In the blog post, Jang said the company recognized, however, that these symbols could also sometimes appear in “genuinely educational or cultural contexts.” The company would move to a strategy of applying technical methods, she wrote, to “better identify and refuse harmful misuse” without completely banning them.\n\n“AI lab employees,” she wrote, “should not be the arbiters of what people should and shouldn’t be allowed to create.”",

We woke up the morning after the Donald Trump–Joe Biden presidential debate to a half dozen versions of what finally became the panic cover we published later that day. Sometimes, saying just a little can leave the biggest impression. We asked several former TIME editors-in-chief how they remember their time working with D.W.\n\nEdward Felsenthal\n\nD.W. is far more than TIME’s creative director—though of course that’s no small job in itself. He’s a maestro of visual storytelling who has played an integral role in TIME’s transformation. As its name implies, TIME is not static. It’s constantly evolving to reflect the world it chronicles. And in an era of instant news, vastly altering the role of a magazine, D.W. has been instrumental in ensuring TIME’s enduring impact.\n\nYou can see that in the almost magical ambition he brings to what’s possible in a small print or digital frame—like the public artist JR’s Guns in America cover, which brought together 245 people on all sides of the gun debate—and then off the page in the form of a multimedia experience that traveled the country. Or Japanese artist Toshihiko Hosaka’s How Earth Survived, a life-size sand sculpture created over 14 days to convey the shared work of addressing climate change. Or replacing the TIME logo —for the very first time—with the word vote ahead of the 2020 presidential election on a Shepard Fairey image, under-scoring the imperative to exercise our democratic right. D.W. has shown time and again that the power of storytelling lies as much in how we see as in what we read.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "An all-star showbiz satire from Seth Rogen. A harrowing British miniseries Netflix subscribers can’t stop raving about. A sort of millennial Dick Cavett Show. A crime comedy centered on a dysfunctional but loving Pakistani American family. A sequel to one of the marquee miniseries of the 2010s, a decade in the making. March’s best new TV shows comprise a real variety pack—one that includes a few of the all-around greatest series we’re likely to see in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdolescence (Netflix)\n\nThe British miniseries Adolescence has become Netflix’s breakout hit of the season, and for good reason. Co-creator and writer Jack Thorne’s third riveting social drama to hit stateside streaming services in two months, after Acorn premiered Best Interests and Toxic Town arrived on Netflix in February, this saga of a 13-year-old boy charged with killing a female classmate speaks profoundly to the impact of social media and that oxymoron “incel culture” on sensitive young minds. The cast—led by co-creator and writer Stephen Graham (Peaky Blinders) and featuring remarkable performances from Top Boy’s Ashley Walters, Graham’s A Thousand Blows co-star Erin Doherty (The Crown, Chloe), procedural stalwart Christine Tremarco, and newcomer Owen Cooper as the diminutive defendant—is a hall of fame of undersung UK television talent. The show is also a technical achievement, with director Philip Barantini’s camera following the characters through each real-time episode in a single dynamic shot. [Read about the sweetest—and most devastating—moment in the Adolescence finale.]\n\nDeli Boys (Hulu)\n\nAh, the American Dream. Step 1: Arrive in Philadelphia with $3 in your pocket. Step 2: Get a job at a deli. Step 3: Buy said deli. Step 4: Invent a ludicrously large to-go cup. Step 5: Use the proceeds to open 40 delis. Step 6: Diversify into the golf course and mango pickle industries. Step 7: Drop dead after taking a golf ball to the head, in front of your two adult sons, who have no idea that you’re a crime boss using your fleet of delis as a front for cocaine distribution. That, at least, is how Baba Dar (Iqbal Theba) amassed his considerable fortune. The Pakistani-born patriarch (Baba is Urdu for father) gets his skull shattered within the first few minutes of the rollicking crime comedy Deli Boys, whose first season is now streaming on Hulu. Which leaves his sons, Raj (Saagar Shaikh) and Mir (Asif Ali), to claim their places atop a hierarchy of gangsters they’d been led to believe was a legitimate business. The brothers are both unsuited to succeed Baba for different reasons. Raj, the elder of the two, spends his days partying with his woo-woo “twin flame,” Prairie (Alfie Fuller), and squandering Baba’s money on drugs. A cleancut junior-executive type, Mir has an MBA; a high-maintenance fiancée, Bushra (Zainne Saleh), and ambitions of rising within Baba’s public-facing company, DarCo. [Read the full review.]\n\nEverybody’s Live with John Mulaney (Netflix)\n\nJohn Mulaney’s six-night stint as a talk show host last May, in which he assembled celebrities in town for Netflix Is a Joke Fest for an endearingly messy live Netflix broadcast called Everybody’s in L.A., was a resounding success. Accordingly, the platform has welcomed him back for 12 more weekly episodes of an hourlong program that is now called Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney. New title aside, Mulaney has made minimal changes to the original format. National treasure Richard Kind is back at the announcer’s podium. Each episode is themed, with eclectic panels of famous guests (Michael Keaton, Joan Baez, Pete Davidson, Quinta Brunson, etc.) and relevant experts responding to viewers’ live call-in anecdotes on the topic du jour (lending money, cruises, funerals). The host’s cultural geekery fuels such gloriously apropos-of-nothing segments as a discussion with 11 actors who’ve played Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman. The music is next-level; Mulaney pulled off the ultimate indie-rock flex of hosting Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon and Pixies’ Kim Deal for their first-ever live duet. Surprise and delight can be hard to find these days, in the increasingly stale environs of late night, but Everybody’s Live is accomplishing it weekly.\n\nThe Studio (Apple TV+)\n\nTen minutes into the Apple TV+ comedy, just about everything we need to know about the new head of Continental is apparent. Movies are Matt’s world. As we soon discover, he has no significant other, no kids, no real social life. His knowledge of cinema, from action franchises and Oscar winners to obscure indies and the international art house, rivals that of any film geek. And, for the most part, he has good intentions; when he gets his promotion, he keeps a promise to make his assistant (Chase Sui Wonders’ Quinn) a creative exec. Yet he’s so desperate to succeed in an industry that is now, itself, desperate to succeed in the face of technological upheaval, labor unrest, audience fragmentation, and a post-pandemic slump in theater attendance, that he is in effect no better than any other spineless suit. Which is precisely how the filmmakers and actors Matt reveres see him. Worse still, he’s insecure enough that this constant rejection sends him into a spiral of self-loathing buffoonery that gives The Studio, created by Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, and Frida Perez, the rhythms of a Curb Your Enthusiasm, Studio Head Edition.\n\nThe Studio is a timely, funny, and exuberantly—though not uncritically—cinephilic panorama of a business caught in the latest battle of a war between art and commerce that has raged since studios like Warner Bros. were still run by their namesakes. It’s also 2025’s best new show to date, and one of Hollywood’s sharpest self-portraits in ages—which is saying something, considering how much the entertainment industry loves to celebrate and satirize itself. [Read the full review.] Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light (PBS)\n\nTyrants giveth when it serves their purposes, but mostly they taketh away. This is the grim lesson—one that the ambitious sycophants who attach themselves to power have always been slow to learn—of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall Trilogy, a series of fat, dense novels that filter the reign of Henry VIII through the rise and fall of his Machiavellian advisor, Thomas Cromwell. The first BBC adaptation, which aired on PBS in 2015, covered Mantel’s books Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, tracing Cromwell’s brilliantly played ascent. A commoner’s son, he reaches the peak of his influence over the crown in the miniseries’ finale, which finds him delivering Anne Boleyn to her gruesome death.\n\nThe pendulum swings in the opposite direction in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, named for the final volume of the trilogy and filmed in the wake of Mantel’s death in 2022. Which makes this long-awaited sequel miniseries a much more melancholy affair than its predecessor. Happily, the change in tone doesn’t mean a dip in quality. Mark Rylance reprises one of the best TV performances of all time, giving us an older, wearier Cromwell who’s prone to dark-night-of-the-soul conversations with the ghost of his mentor, Cardinal Wolsey (the great Jonathan Pryce). Damian Lewis remains wonderfully bratty as Henry. Writer Peter Straughan (Conclave) and director Peter Kosminsky return as well, pulling together a subtle, unabashedly dialogue-heavy adaptation that serves Mantel’s language and the cast’s virtuosity instead of competing with them.",

        "content": "'Banal and hollow': Why the quaint paintings of Thomas Kinkade divided the US\n\n7 hours ago Share Save Nicholas Barber Share Save\n\n(Image credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nBeloved by many, despised by others, Thomas Kinkade's quaint rustic scenes and his wholesome image belied a dark and tortured story that contrasts with his 'sugary' artworks.\n\nThomas Kinkade was one of the best-selling artists in history, as well as one of the most divisive. When he died in 2012, the American painter had been rocked by business problems, but at his commercial peak a decade earlier, his company was bringing in more than $100m a year. And yet his work was despised by many critics – not because it was blasphemous or obscene, but because, well, he specialised in quaint pictures of thatched-roof rural cottages nestling in leafy groves. \"Thomas Kinkade's style is illustrative saccharine fantasy rather than art with which you can connect at any meaningful level,\" Charlotte Mullins, the author of A Little History of Art, tells the BBC. \"It is schmaltzy pastiches of Disney-style woodland scenes, complete with cutesy animals and fairy tale cottages. They are… like the images you find on cheap greetings cards – sugary and forgettable.\" And compared to some critics, Mullins is being polite.\n\nHis branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all – Miranda Yousef\n\nThese critics don't just consider Kinkade's paintings to be nauseatingly sickly, they detect something disturbing and ominous about them. In her 2003 book on California, Where I Was From, Joan Didion summed up his art by saying. \"It typically featured a cottage or a house of such insistent cosiness as to seem actually sinister, suggestive of a trap designed to attract Hansel and Gretel. Every window was lit, to lurid effect, as if the interior of the structure might be on fire.\" As harsh as that sounds, Didion may have been more perceptive than she realised. Art for Everybody, a new documentary directed by Miranda Yousef, shows that the man who called himself the \"Painter of Light\" did indeed have a dark side. \"His branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all,\" Yousef tells the BBC. \"He lived a Greek tragedy of a life.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade specialised in quaint pictures of rural cottages, which were loved by many, but despised by critics (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nThe documentary features audio tapes recorded by Kinkade when he was a long-haired, bohemian-looking art student in California in the 1970s – and even then, he was already fretting over the question of whether he could make an impact as an artist while making a decent living. After a stint in Hollywood, painting backgrounds for Ralph Bakshi's 1983 animated feature film, Fire and Ice, he concentrated on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, and he and his wife Nanette sold reproductions of them outside a local grocer's shop. In the 1990s, he took the idealism and the nostalgia to new heights, and swapped his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes that a Hobbit might deem a bit on the twee side. Old-fashioned lampposts and cottage windows glowed. Streams twinkled beneath slender stone footbridges. Bushes burst with pastel flowers. And cash registers rang. Kinkade didn't sell the paintings themselves, but the hazy idylls they depicted were soon being printed on collectible plates advertised in newspapers and magazines. For many Americans, they were comforting refuges from the modern world.\n\nToday we would think they had been produced by AI, designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula – Charlotte Mullins\n\nIn Art for Everybody, Christopher Knight, the art critic of the Los Angeles Times, is contemptuous of Kinkade's imagery. \"It's a cliché piled upon a fantasy piled upon a bad idea,\" he says. \"The colour is juiced and the light coming from inside those cottages is intense and blaring.\" Just as importantly, as far as his critics were concerned, Kinkade's pictures had nothing to them beyond their superficial decorative qualities. \"They are banal and hollow, with no intent to say anything meaningful,\" says Mullins. \"Today we would think they had been produced by AI – designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula.\" But Yousef insists that Kinkade's skill can't be discounted. \"There were actually other people who were painting cottages and Christmas scenes and putting them on plates and all that stuff,\" she notes, \"and the thing is that Kinkade's were so much better. His works just blew everybody else's out of the water.\"\n\nShe also believes that Kinkade's paintings, rather than being wholly market-led, were linked to his childhood in Placerville, California, where he was raised by his single mother and only intermittently saw his violent father. \"It's a common criticism that his cottages look like they're on fire on the inside. And then you learn that it was because when he was growing up it was always cold and dark in the house when he got home, because they didn't have the money to keep the heat and the lights on. He was painting the thing that he wanted.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade focused on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, before swapping his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nKinkade's deprived upbringing, says Yousef, didn't just inspire his choice of subject matter, but drove him to make as much money as he could. He and his business partners printed pictures on an industrial scale, as well as putting his immediately recognisable imagery on furniture and ornaments, and selling them on the QVC shopping network. They also set up hundreds of faux olde worlde Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries in shopping malls around the US, and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand. Again, Yousef doesn't see Kinkade as entirely calculating. Having grown up in a house with no pictures on the walls, \"He sincerely believed that art should be accessible to everyone.\"\n\nBehind the fantasy\n\nWhatever you thought of the paintings, the mass-marketing of the work of a single artist was certainly groundbreaking. In interviews at the time, Kinkade asserted that he was no different from an author selling stacks of novels or a musician selling CDs. He even declared that by industrialising his output, he was doing what Andy Warhol had always dreamt of. But Mullins argues that Kinkade was being \"obfuscatory and disingenuous\" by churning out reproductions by the thousand, paying his assistants to add a few dabs of paint here and there, and then selling these prints for thousands of dollars, as if they were rare and precious works of art. \"Prints offer an affordable way of buying art by great artists,\" she says. \"They retain their value through the limited nature of the edition. This was never Kinkade's strategy.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade printed pictures and merchandise on an industrial scale and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nStill, this sort of disagreement between Kinkade and his critics was one of his selling points. Art for Everybody features news reports and promotional videos, in which he tells adoring audiences that his art could be understood and appreciated by everyone, whereas only the snooty elite could see anything artistic about Chris Ofili putting elephant dung on his canvases, or Tracey Emin presenting her unmade bed to gallery-goers. \"This is not legitimate art,\" he proclaimed. As much a televangelist as a painter, Kinkade was a born-again Christian who assured his devotees that buying his work put them on the right side of a political and spiritual line separating them from decadent metropolitan tastemakers. He trademarked the sobriquet \"Painter of Light\", not just because of all the sunlit clouds and fiery cottages in his pictures, but to signify that he was a force for virtue and Christianity. \"The art world is a world of darkness today,\" he thundered. He, in contrast, was \"someone who stands up for family and God and country and beauty\". A doughy, plaid shirt-wearing fellow with a thick moustache, he often appeared on television with his blonde wife and his four blonde daughters: the embodiment of wholesome, traditional, all-American values. His fans weren't just paying for his pictures; they were paying to associate themselves with this proudly conservative persona.\n\nBut that persona, like the pictures themselves, was more a fantasy that Kinkade wished for than an accurate representation of reality. He was prone to swearing after the directors of his mawkishvideos called \"cut\". He relied on alcohol to cope with work pressures. And, in the documentary, his daughters say that they were encouraged to smile in videos and personal appearances, but often felt as if their father cared more about his career than about them. \"Thomas Kinkade and his persona and his brand really cast an extraordinarily long, dark shadow over his entire family,\" says Yousef, \"and there was a lot wrapped up in perpetuating the brand and preserving it.\"\n\nIn order to maintain this brand and the vast business empire that went with it, Kinkade had to present himself as a Christian paragon, and he had to complete a stylistically identical painting every month. That meant that he had to suppress other, more conflicted parts of his psyche. The strain became too much. In the mid-2000s, Kinkade fell out with his business partners, and had legal battles with gallery franchisees. He reinvented himself as a womanising, hard-drinking hellraiser. After some interventions by his friends and family, some time in rehab, and the collapse of his marriage, he died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and diazepam at the age of 54.\n\nArt for Everybody The documentary Art for Everybody explores the dark, troubled person behind the wholesome persona Kinkade had created (Credit: Art for Everybody)\n\nIt was only after his death that his family sorted through the vault containing his artwork, and uncovered a stash of bleak, violent drawings and paintings that seemed to express his inner rage and fear in a way that his cottage paintings never could: a shack in the middle of nowhere on a murky night; a nun pointing a gun at herself; giant monsters and distorted faces. Art for Everybody raises the questions of whether these pictures are more authentic than the ones the public knew about. Do they express how Kinkade really felt about his difficult upbringing and his frightening father? Would it have been healthier for him to explore the shadowy netherworlds in these pictures instead of shutting himself inside his stifling sylvan cottages, year after year? And were his critics right to say that his famous paintings were disturbing all along? \"One of the things that was obvious early on,\" says Yousef, \"was that his fans had a two-dimensional view of him and his critics had another completely different two-dimensional view of him. I knew there was a three-dimensional person in there somewhere, and that's what I wanted to try to find.\"\n\nIn some ways, Kinkade was ahead of his time. First, he was a culture warrior before culture wars were being fought as fiercely as they are now. As someone who claimed that he was taking a stand for Christianity and patriotism and against the intellectual elite, he was staking out territory occupied by more and more in the US today. He was also ahead of his time as an artist with such a brazen commercial side. \"Today we're seeing all these artist collabs,\" says Yousef. \"There's Yayoi Kusama who's working with Louis Vuitton, and Tom Sachs is working with Nike, and Kehinde Wiley is doing a collab with American Express, whereas you see in the movie an MBNA bank card with a Thomas Kinkade painting on it. He was already doing it 20 or 30 years ago.\"\n\nFinally, by calling himself the Painter of Light, and by trading on his pious family-man persona, Kinkade turned himself into a kind of product. \"Look at where we are today with social media, and everybody being a brand,\" says Yousef. \"He was really ahead of his time with that. But I think that one of the big questions of the film is, what are the costs of turning yourself into a brand?\" In Kinkade's case, the costs were unbearably high.\n\nArt for Everybody is released on 28 March in the US.\n\n--",

Unsurprisingly, this incredibly diverse city was teeming with international culinary influences. There was Mexican food from across the border; fresh Vietnamese flavours brought by refugees in the 1970s; and New Orleans-style food from people who moved here after Hurricane Katrina. Middle Eastern food was everywhere too, from vast emporiums stocked with brined olives, tabbouleh and vats of hummus to street vendors serving freshly made kebabs. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nA take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. But what sets the sandwich apart is its creator: Jalal Antone, the Louisiana-born, Texas-raised son of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. His version of a chow chow recipe had a bold Middle Eastern influence, swapping out traditional mustard and celery seeds for paprika and turmeric, giving the relish a striking orange hue and a deeper, spiced complexity.\n\nAntone dreamed of starting a Middle Eastern import store but was unsure of how it would be received by Houstonians at the time. In 1962, he finally opened Antone's Import Company on Taft Street, selling imported spices, olives, hummus, falafel and tabouli. At the time, most of Houston's half a million residents were unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food. To win them over, he devised a simple but effective solution: a sandwich.\n\n\"Houstonians were eating burgers in those days,\" explains Craig Lieberman, CEO of Antone's. \"The story is that he asked his friends 'How do I sell a product to Houstonians?' They said, 'Come up with a chow chow recipe and put that on your sandwich'.\"\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Jalal Antone came up with a twist on a classic sandwich to encourage people to come to his Middle Eastern import store (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nAntone sourced French bread from a local bakery, layered it with his imported meats and cheeses and added his signature spiced chow chow. The result? A sandwich that became a Houston staple.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Antone's had become a wild success, with people flocking there from far and wide. A postcard dating from Antone's early years describes the store as a \"tempting world of foreign foods\" while a 1965 Houston Chronicle article notes that the store was stocked with cheeses, olives, eels and even squid pickled in their own ink. But what kept people coming back were the sandwiches.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nRestaurant critic Alison Cook remembers eating the affordable, filling Antone's Original sandwiches as a student at Rice University in 1966, describing the experience in a 2017 Houston Chronicle article. \"It was founded to cater primarily to the local Syrian and Lebanese community, but the po' boys made it a mecca for Houstonians of all stripes. To my impressionable 19-year-old brain, the rambling Antone's space was an exotic wonderland, chockablock with foodstuffs from the Middle East and beyond, festooned with sausages and crammed with cheeses I'd never heard of. In a city where steakhouses, seafood palaces and Italian American spots ruled the dining scene, Antone's pointed the way to a wider world.\"\n\nSome of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants – Megha McSwain\n\nThrough the 1970s and 80s, the Houston po' boy cemented itself as a local lunchtime staple, on par with tacos and barbecue. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born. Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Antone’s po’ boys are also sold at the groundbreaking Antone’s nightclub in Austin, which brought the blues to Texas (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\n\"Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,\" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. \"These were really adventurous flavours for people at the time. The story of how they moved forward by creating something unique is why they've lasted so long.\"\n\nWhere to try Houston's most iconic sandwich\n\nAlthough Antone's original import store is long gone, the Houston po' boy lives on. Antone's Famous Po' Boys still has two locations in Houston – one inside The Galleria, the city's massive megamall, and another in the Heights neighbourhood, where you can grab a sandwich alongside Lebanese tabouli and dolmas.\n\nIf you can't make it to a sandwich shop, Antone's po' boys are sold in grocery stores across Texas, including H-E-B, Randall's, Kroger, and Brookshire Brothers. They're even stocked in hospital cafes and at Texan universities like Baylor and The University of Texas. If you're looking for a taste of Antone's at home, their proprietary chow chow can be bought by the jar at local supermarkets along with their pickles.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Visitors to Houston can find jars of Antone's chow chow in local supermarkets (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nThough Houston's food scene continues to evolve, the po' boy remains a symbol of the city's culinary melting pot – a sandwich born from Middle Eastern ingenuity, shaped by Southern tradition and beloved by generations of Houstonians.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many Texans grew up on Antone's,\" says Lieberman. \"We still use the same bread from Royal Bakery and the same recipes that Jalal created; it's a very nostalgic and beloved Texas brand.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

In China last weekend, he qualified last for both the sprint and the grand prix, and finished 14th and 12th.\n\nWorld champion Verstappen was second in Melbourne and fourth in Shanghai. The next race is the Japanese Grand Prix, from 4-6 April.\n\nLawson, 23, admitted he found his demotion \"tough\" but said he is excited to work with his former team Racing Bulls.\n\n\"Being a Red Bull Racing driver has been my dream since I was a kid, it's what I've worked towards my whole life,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"I'm grateful for everything that's brought me to this point. To every one of you who's stood by me, thank you for all the support. It means the world.\"\n\nMarko said that Tsunoda, 24, would be given \"to the end of the season\" at Red Bull to prove himself \"because we believe he can do the job\".\n\nAsked why the Japanese was the right driver now, when they had decided at the end of last season that Lawson was a better bet, Marko said: \"Tsunoda made a big step. It's strange after four years, now in his fifth year, he is a much stronger personality, he has more confidence and he did two very good races, it's just his strategy didn't work at Racing Bulls.\n\n\"In this case, a very difficult car experience is something that will help. That was our thoughts.\"\n\nMarko said that Red Bull decided not to give Lawson another chance at the Japanese Grand Prix, which is the first race this season to be held on a circuit Lawson has experienced before, because \"we were worried that his self-confidence is so damaged that he couldn't bring his normal performance\".\n\nHe added: \"And on the other hand we have two drivers for the constructors' championship but also to support Max strategy-wise, if you have two drivers top five or eight it is easier to max a strategy that favours the number-one driver.\"\n\nMarko insisted that the swap with Tsunoda was \"not a demotion\" for Lawson.\n\n\"He's not kicked out of F1 and Racing Bulls will give him the chance to recover and his career will start again,\" Marko said.\n\nHe pointed to the experience of drivers Red Bull had previously dropped as evidence that Lawson could rebuild his career.\n\nMarko said: \"For the benefit for him, he goes back to Racing Bulls, which has a car capable to be top 10 in qualifying and the race.\n\n\"Just look in the past, it was [Pierre] Gasly, it happened the same, also to [Alex] Albon and they recovered and they are now competitive F1 drivers.\n\n\"On top of it, the RB21 is a car which is not the fastest car but nevertheless very difficult to drive and Max can handle but not at this stage Liam.\"",

They're Bosnian Mountain Horses, descendants of domesticated horses that were released into the wild due to various reasons, from war to industrialisation, and have since been saved from extinction.\n\n\"Horses like this were once the backbone of the agricultural industry here,\" BBC Travel Show host Rajan Datar said in a recent episode on the region. \"But once tractors and modern machinery arrived, many farmers set their horses free to fend for themselves in the wild.\"\n\nRajan Datar explores a secret tunnel that protected citizens during the seige of Sarajevo.\n\nBecause of their domesticated roots, the horses are less wary of humans than true wild horses, which has made them a draw for tourists but also a source of tension. In winter, they can often be found licking salt from roads in the winter, becoming a danger both to drivers and themselves. They have also been known to raid local farms for food, destroying crops and stealing water from livestock. Many locals see them as a nuisance, and some farmers have even gone so far as to kill horses found on their land. A 2009 decision to protect the herds was rescinded in 2017 due to the overwhelming cost of the damage claims.\n\nAlamy Wild horses Livno Bosnia Herzegovina: Tourism has helped both Livno’s wild horses and the town itself thrive (Credit: Alamy)\n\nYet, in recent years, attitudes have begun to shift. As tourism to the country has increased in the past two decades, so has visitor interest in the animals. Their nomadic nature means that local guides are necessary to view the horses, and a host of local tourism businesses have cropped up to meet this demand, creating a significant economic impact in this rural region.\n\nLocal community organisations, such as the Environmental Association of Borova Glava, have also stepped in to help care for the animals and mitigate conflicts. For volunteers like Zeljko Kristo, a spokesperson for the organisation, the horses also serve as a symbol of how the country has healed from the war, which raged from 1992 to 1995 following the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n\"Besides humans, horses also found themselves in an awkward situation because [of the war],\" he explained. \"Looking back, years have passed, and we managed to save them – but at the same time, we saved ourselves.\"\n\nFor travellers interested in seeing the horses, Livno is the best place to start. The animals are commonly found roaming the hills and valleys around this part of the country, but their movements can be unpredictable. To increase the chance of seeing them, it's highly recommended that visitors hire a guide, who will be more knowledgeable about the horses' movements and habits. Local tour companies also provide transportation from town to the more remote areas where the herds can be found. What's more, many of these businesses donate some of the proceeds from their tours to the care of the animals, ensuring they can continue to roam these wild landscapes for years to come.\n\n--",

        "content": "Rembrandt to Picasso: Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\n12 March 2025 Share Save Kelly Grovier Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe recent discovery of an art forger's workshop reminds us of the long history of fraudulent artworks – here are the simple rules to work them out.\n\nIt's everywhere: fake news, deep fakes, identity fraud. So ensnared are we in a culture of digitised deceptions, a phenomenon increasingly augmented by artificial intelligence, it would be easy to think that deceit itself is a high-tech invention of the cyber age. Recent revelations however – from the discovery of an elaborate, if decidedly low-tech, art forger's workshop in Rome to the sensational allegation that a cherished Baroque masterpiece in London's National Gallery is a crude simulacrum of a lost original – remind us that duplicity in the world of art has a long and storied history, one written not in binary ones and zeroes, but in impossible pigments, clumsy brushstrokes and suspicious signatures. When it comes to falsification and phoniness, there is indeed no new thing under the Sun.\n\nOn 19 February, Italy's Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage uncovered a covert forgery operation in a northern district of Rome. Authorities confiscated more than 70 fraudulent artworks falsely attributed to notable artists from Pissarro to Picasso, Rembrandt to Dora Maar, along with materials used to mimic vintage canvases, artist signatures, and the stamps of galleries no longer in operation. The suspect, who has yet to be apprehended, is thought to have used online platforms such as Catawiki and eBay to hawk their phoney wares, deceiving potential buyers with convincing certificates of authenticity that they likewise contrived.\n\nNews of the clandestine lab's discovery was quickly followed by publicity for a new book, due for release this week, alleging that one of The National Gallery's highlights is not at all what it seems. According to artist and historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis, author of NG6461: The Fake National Gallery Rubens, the painting Samson and Delilah – a large oil-on-wood attributed to the 17th Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and purchased by the London museum in 1980 for £2.5m (then the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction) – is three centuries younger than the date of 1609-10 that sits beside it on the gallery wall and is incalculably less accomplished than the museum believes.\n\nAlamy Samson and Delilah, by Peter Paul Rubens (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDoxiadis's conclusion corroborates one reached in 2021 by the Swiss company, Art Recognition, which determined, through the use of AI, that there was a 91% probability that Samson and Delilah is the work of someone other than Rubens. Her assertion that the brushwork we see in the painting is crass and wholly inconsistent with the fluid flow of the Flemish master's hand is strongly contested by The National Gallery, which stands by its attribution. \"Samson and Delilah has long been accepted by leading Rubens scholars as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens\", it said in a statement given to the BBC. \"Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality. A technical examination of the picture was presented in an article in The National Gallery's Technical Bulletin in 1983. The findings remain valid.\"\n\nThe divergence of opinion between the museum's experts and those who doubt the work's authenticity opens a curious space in which to reflect on intriguing questions of artistic value and merit. Is there ever legitimacy in forgery? Can fakes be masterpieces? As more sophisticated tools of analysis are applied to paintings and drawings whose legitimacy has long been in question (including several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the hotly disputed chalk and ink drawing La Bella Principessa), as well as those whose validity has never been in doubt, debates about the integrity of cultural icons are only likely to accelerate. What follows are a handful of handy principles to keep in mind when navigating the impending controversies – five simple rules for spotting a fake masterpiece.\n\nRule 1: Pigments never lie\n\nAlamy Portrait of Saint Jerome (Credit: Alamy)\n\nTo be a successful art forger requires more than technical proficiency and a misplaced ethical compass. It isn't enough to approximate the dibby-dabby dots of a Georges Seurat, say, or the thick expressive swirls of Vincent van Gogh. You need to know your history as well as your chemistry. Anachronistic pigments will give you away every time and were the downfall of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene, who succeeded in selling makeshift modernist masterpieces for millions before a careless squeeze of prefab paint onto their audacious palettes in 2006 sealed their fate.\n\nBeltracchi, whose modus operandi was to create \"new\" works by everyone from Max Ernst to André Derain, rather than recreate lost ones, was always careful to mix his own paints to ensure they contained only ingredients available to whomever he was attempting to impersonate. He only slipped up once. And that was enough. Fabricating a wonky Der Blaue Reiter-ish red landscape of jigsawed horses that he attributed to the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, Beltracchi reached for a readymade tube of paint, which he hadn't realised contained a pinch of titanium white – a relatively new pigment to which Campendonk would not have had access. It was all investigators would need to prove the work, which had sold for €2.8m, was a fake.\n\nBeltracchi was unlucky. The gap between titanium white's availability and its potential use by Campendonk was only a few years. On occasion, the divide is shockingly wide. Analysis of a Portrait of Saint Jerome, once attributed to the Italian master Parmigianino and sold by Sotheby's auction house in 2012 for $842,500, exposed the prevalence throughout the work of phthalocyanine green, a synthetic pigment invented in 1935, four centuries after the 16th-Century Renaissance artist worked. Artists may be visionaries, but they're not time travellers.\n\nRule 2: Keep the past present\n\nMuseum Boijmans Van Beuningan The Men at Emmaus, by Han van Meegeren (Credit: Museum Boijmans Van Beuningan)\n\nIt is uplifting to believe that one's value, as a person, is not tethered to the past. Not so with art. A painting, sculpture, or drawing without a heavy history is not, alas, more inspiring for its lack of baggage. It is suspicious. Or rather, it should be. All too often, greed can interfere in the clear-sightedness of assessing the authenticity of a painting or sculpture. Things have histories we want them to have. That was certainly the case with a succession of phoney Vermeers that issued from the workshop of a Dutch portraitist, Han van Meegeren – one of the most prolific and successful forgers of the 20th Century. Desperate to believe that the miraculous appearance of canvases, including a depiction of Christ and The Men at Emmaus, might be lost masterpieces from the same hand that made Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Milkmaid, collectors were blind to the glaring absence of any trace of the paintings' provenance – their prior ownership, exhibition history, and proof of sales. Everyone was fooled.\n\nIn authenticating the painting in the Burlington Magazine, one expert insisted \"in no other picture by the great Master of Delft do we find such sentiment, such a profound understanding of the Bible story – a sentiment so nobly human expressed through the medium of the highest art\". But it was all a lie. In a remarkable twist, Van Meegeren eventually chose to expose himself as a fraudster shortly after the end of World War Two, after being charged by Dutch authorities with the crime of selling a Vermeer – therefore a national treasure – to the Nazi official Hermann Göring. To prove his innocence, if innocence it might be called, and demonstrate that he had merely sold a worthless fake of his own forging, not a real Old Master, Van Meegeren performed the extraordinary feat of whisking up a fresh masterpiece from thin air before the experts' astonished eyes. Voilà, Vermeer.\n\nThe Hay Wain, by John Constable (Credit: BBC)\n\nMore recently, in a 2017 episode of BBC's popular arts programme Fake or Fortune?, presenter Philip Mould's long-held hunch that a painting he once sold for £35,000 was really a priceless original by the English Romantic artist John Constable – an alternative, and previously undocumented, view of the landscape artist's 1821 masterpiece The Hay Wain – was dramatically confirmed after Mould and fellow presenter Fiona Bruce excavated long-buried financial records. Having traced the painting's ownership back to a sale by the artist's son, the team recalculated the canvass true value to be £2m, proving that some pasts are worth hanging onto.\n\nRule 3: Squint\n\nArtists' gestures – their simultaneously studied and instinctive brushwork and draughtsmanship – are nothing less than fingerprints writ large across canvases and works on paper. One artist's lightness of touch and another's sturdiness of stroke are exceedingly tricky to falsify, especially if you are conscious that every twitch of your brush and jot of your pen will be scrutinised by suspicious eyes and cutting-edge equipment. Pressure under pressure is hard to maintain, an obstacle that the British forger Eric Hebborn (who died under suspicious circumstances in Rome in 1996 after a career spent counterfeiting more than 1,000 works attributed to everyone from Mantegna to Tiepolo, Poussin to Piranesi) overcame with alcohol.\n\nBy all accounts, brandy was Hebborn's tipple of choice for calming his rattling nerves. It allowed him to inhabit, without inhibition, the mind and muscle of whichever old master he was channelling. Whereas fakes from the hands of Beltracchi and Van Meegeren have since been found under closer inspection to be riddled with incoherent gestures, the fluidity of drawings falsified by the tipsy Hebborn in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s continues to confound the experts. To this day, institutions that possess works that passed through his hands refuse to accept they are all fakes, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's pen and ink drawing View of the Temples of Venus and of Diana in Baia from the South, a work it still insists is from the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder. What do you think?\n\nRule 4: Go deeper\n\nGetty Images Still life with meadow flowers and roses, by Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhen the analysis of pigments, provenance, and paintbrush pressure still leaves you stumped, it may be necessary to dive a little deeper. For 20 years since the 1990s, the authenticity of a still life purportedly by Vincent van Gogh was serially confirmed and refuted by experts. To some, the garish reds and submarine blues that echoed eerily from the bouquet of roses, daisies, and wildflowers didn't have the ring of truth and seemed at odds with the painter's palette. The absence of any ownership record for the painting didn't help.\n\nBut an X-ray undertaken in 2012 put questions to rest when it revealed that the artist, pinching pennies, reused a canvas on which he had created another image entirely – one to which he makes explicit reference in a letter from January 1886. \"This week\", Van Gogh remarked to his brother Theo, \"I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers… and I really like doing that.\" As if proleptically anticipating the ensuing scholarly wrangle over the work's authenticity that the painting would in time trigger, the static tussle of the two athletes, trapped beneath paint for over a century, not only rescued the work from unfair allegations of illegitimacy, it created a kind of fresh composite painting, a vivid compression – a freeze frame of a restless mind forever scuffling with itself, desperate to survive.\n\nRule 5: It's the little things that give you away\n\nAs a final safeguard in authenticating a work of art, run the spell check. Doing so would have saved the collector Pierre Lagrange $17m – the price he paid in 2007 for an otherwise compelling forgery of a small 12x18in (30x46cm) painting falsely attributed to the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable \"c\" before the final \"k\". The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery.\n\nThe sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, \"Mr X\". Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished; he later turned up in China.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrakë, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\n\nJaprakë holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\n\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\n\nAlamy Japrakë is a popular Albanian dish among both Christians and Muslims (Credit: Alamy)\n\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\n\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens – 20% of the population – fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine – except for women of a certain age.\n\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\n\nAlamy Albania was once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\" (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\n\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ciğeri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlijaš (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\n\nSome indigenous foods, like mishavinë (a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.\n\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\n\nAlamy Flia is a typical and very popular Albanian dish (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.\n\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\n\nAlamy Albanians had to make certain religious dishes, like halva, in secret during communism (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\n\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\n\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\n\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tavë krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\n\nUka Farm Following the fall of communism, many farmers migrated to Albanian cities, leaving only the elderly behind (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\n\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\n\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\n\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\nUka Farm Uka Farm uses recipes from grandmothers like Xhahysa (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\n\nXhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\n\nXhahysa's recipe of fërgesë (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjizë (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania’s forgotten past.\n\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\n\nMullixhiu Chef Bledar Kola has been turning to Albanian grandmothers to revive the nation's traditional cuisine (Credit: Mullixhiu)\n\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\n\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\n\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\n\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\n\nAlamy Thanks to Albanian grandmothers, the nation's once-forgotten foods are returning (Credit: Alamy)\n\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods – many sourced from grandmothers – is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\n\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what René [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\n\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\n\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\n\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Van Gogh's Postman Joseph Roulin, 1888 – Roulin was a close friend and loyal ally of the artist (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\nRoulin wasn't just a model for Van Gogh – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship – Katie Hanson\n\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits – the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\n\nA new life in Arles\n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A pen, ink and chalk portrait of Roulin, 1888, is among the exhibits in the show Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Café de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the café, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\n\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness, despair and impending doom seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who described him as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Portrait of Joseph Roulin, 1889 – Van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family were full of warmth and optimism (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter – on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\n\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Roulin's wife is portrayed in Lullaby: Madame Augustine Rocking a Cradle (La Berceuse) 1889 (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\n\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice – on furnishing the yellow house for example – and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Baby Marcelle Roulin and Armand Roulin, both 1888 – Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the family (Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good Doctor and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\n\nVan Gogh lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies\n\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours – green, blue, yellow or red – vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection – a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\n\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\n\nCredit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A photograph of Joseph Roulin in 1902, 12 years after the death of his friend Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\n\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process – and his ways of creating connection – will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\n\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The pioneering building that scandalised Paris\n\n1 day ago Share Save Dominic Lutyens Share Save\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/ Enrico Cano (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ Enrico Cano)\n\nThe daring, radical Pompidou Centre was derided by many when its design was first unveiled – yet it has continued to influence the architecture of public buildings ever since. As the building approaches a major renovation, its co-creator Renzo Piano recalls the furore.\n\nThis summer, the Centre Pompidou will close for five years, as Paris's popular polychrome landmark undergoes changes necessitated by current requirements in terms of health, safety and energy efficiency. French studio Moreau Kusunoki Architects, Mexican practice Frida Escobedo Studio and French engineer AIA Life Designers will undertake a major overhaul of the six-storey arts centre, containing Europe's largest museum of modern art. Its renovation will add usable floor space, remove asbestos from all facades, improve fire safety and accessibility for people with reduced mobility, and optimise energy efficiency.\n\nGetty Images The Pompidou Centre's \"inside-out\" structure was ground-breaking (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs far as possible, the original building will be conserved as it was before. To do otherwise might be considered cultural sacrilege – after all the Pompidou's identity is indivisible from its original architects, Renzo Piano, and the late Richard Rogers. The duo set up their practice, Rogers + Piano, in 1970, and submitted a design to a prestigious competition instigated in 1971 by Georges Pompidou, France’s President from 1969 until 1974. Its jury was headed up by Jean Prouvé, a metalworker and self-taught architect, and included such stellar architects as Philip Johnson and Oscar Niemeyer. Piano and Rogers' design was chosen from 681 competition entries.\n\nOur idea was a museum that would inspire curiosity, not intimidate people, and that would open up culture to all – Renzo Piano\n\nThe result caught the duo, then unknowns in their 30s \"with Beatles haircuts\", as Piano puts it, by surprise: \"We didn't think we'd win, we entered the competition for pleasure,\" the Italian architect, now 87, tells the BBC. \"We never planned to create a revolutionary building. Our idea was a museum that would inspire curiosity, not intimidate people, and that would open up culture to all.\"\n\nIn fact, the duo's insouciance may help to explain the building's uninhibited boldness, flamboyance and ludic quality. Its structural elements and services were placed on its facades, allowing it to maximise its internal, open-plan spaces – and prompting the futuristic structure to be dubbed the world’s first \"inside-out\" building. Its exoskeleton of tubes and periscope-like pipes were playfully colour-coded: blue for air-conditioning, yellow for electricity, green for water and red for pedestrian circulation. Visitors streamed up escalators – encased in transparent tubing affording panoramic views – that were designed to reinforce the museum's connection to the city.\n\n\"Our idea was for the building to take up only half the site, allowing for a welcoming outdoor place – a piazza – where people could meet,\" says Piano, whose other projects include the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco (rebuilt in 2008), the Shard (2012) in London, and the recently completed Paddington Square, also in the UK capital, a mixed-use building and public square. \"Our credo was a place for all people – for the poor and rich, the young and old.\"\n\nCulture Shifters Culture Shifters is an interview series in which high-profile creatives reflect on a work of theirs which made a big impact on the world. Read more articles from the series here.\n\nThe Pompidou's transparency, accessibility and adjacent piazza chimed with new ideas about democratising culture. \"Street theatre and concerts in public spaces were rising in popularity at the time,\" says Piano.\n\nInside the building, visitors had access to the Bibliothèque Publique d'Information – Paris's first free public library – the Musée National d'Art Moderne and the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/ Musique (IRCAM), dedicated to research of music and sound.\n\nPiano and Rogers' winning entry provoked consternation and fury when it was announced at a press conference: \"The room was packed,\" remembers Piano. \"Richard and I were standing in the middle of the room being heckled. We felt elated yet terrible at the same time,\" says the architect. \"Some people were shouting, 'Why have you designed something so horrible?' 'Why are you are destroying Paris's historic centre?'\"\n\nCentre Pompidou Richard Rogers (far left), Renzo Piano (far right) and team pictured in 1971 on the day the winning Pompidou Centre architectural team was announced (Credit: Centre Pompidou)\n\nAlthough surprised to have won the contest, Genoa-born Piano grew up feeling architecture was his destiny – aged 18, he told his father he wanted to be an architect. However in conversation his manner is humble, not entitled. Born into a family of builders in Genoa, he loved watching his father's work take shape. Perhaps his childhood experience of seeing buildings materialise successfully made him feel that architecture is open to all possibilities. \"Building is a beautiful gesture,\" he once told The Financial Times. \"It's the opposite of destruction… especially when you are creating buildings for people because they are civically important.\" In 1981, Piano founded the Renzo Piano Building Workshop (RPBW), with offices in Genoa and Paris, led today by 11 partners (in the spirit of a collective). In 1998, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize.\n\nThe Plateau Beaubourg in central Paris – a stretch of wasteland occupied by a car park – was the site chosen for the new Musée Nationale d'Art Moderne (formerly housed in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris's haut-bourgeois 16th arrondissement). \"It was a place waiting for something to happen,\" says Piano.\n\nA moment of change\n\nFrance's social and political climate at the time, still rebellious following the tumultuous events of May 1968, was conducive to the creation of a building as disruptive as the Centre Pompidou, acknowledges Piano: \"In Britain, society was being revolutionised by [designer] Mary Quant and the Beatles. The same was happening in Paris.\" The Centre Pompidou was partly inspired by the ultra-pop architecture of experimental London-based architecture collective Archigram.\n\nDenancé, Michel The Pompidou Centre was a triumph of bold, radical design – though initially it was met with shock (Credit: Denancé, Michel)\n\n\"The idea that France should have a 'Maison de la Culture', bringing together art, cinema, music and literature in cities was first invented by André Malraux [novelist, art theorist and France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs]. Pompidou was very supportive, too. I really believe that major shifts in architecture are only possible if you have a good client. George's wife, Claude, too, was an excellent lady.\"\n\nIt changed the way a whole generation of architects think about buildings – placing their users at centre stage – Hugh Broughton\n\nPompidou, like Claude, was passionate about contemporary art and design. In 1972, they invited Pierre Paulin, a designer known for his space-age era furniture, to create new interiors for the private apartment of the Elysée Palace, the French presidents' official residence. The results were radically modern – the walls of the living room, dining room and smoking room were lined to cocooning effect with wool and polyester panels that obscured the residence's neo-classical splendour. Walls were hung with paintings by Robert Delaunay and other modernist artists.\n\nRPBW Architects The Pompidou's co-creator Renzo Piano has since designed many other influential buildings, including London's Shard (Credit: Lehoux, Nic/ RPBW Architects)\n\nOne impetus behind these efforts to provide Paris with a prestigious museum was that France had lost its reputation as the world's pre-eminent centre of avant-garde art. \"It is my passionate wish for Paris to have a cultural centre like the ones they've been creating in the US,\" Pompidou told Le Monde newspaper in 1972. \"It will be both a museum and centre of creation, where the visual arts take up residence with music, film, books and audiovisual research.\"\n\nRENZO PIANO'S FIVE CULTURE SHIFTERS Jorge Luis Borges – The Aleph and Other Stories (1949) In particular the short story called Story of the Warrior and the Captive. Filippo Brunelleschi – The dome of Florence Cathedral (1420-1436) Italo Calvino – The Baron in the Trees (1957) I love this novel for its lightness of being. Hal Ashby – Being There (1979) This film is extraordinary for the irony with which it explores such an important topic as politics, and the gardener's metaphors, which are interpreted as wise practical guidance. Pontus Hultén – The Paris-Moscow exhibition at the Pompidou Centre (1979) Because it was an exhibition about two worlds that did not know each other, but shared the same artistic and expressive urgencies.\n\nInitially, reactions to the Centre Pompidou, frequently compared to an alien spaceship, were often extremely negative. \"Taxi drivers used to say to me: 'Regardez!' before launching into a tirade against the building. With so much hostility, I had to keep a low profile among strangers,\" says Piano. The building, derisively likened by many to an \"oil refinery\", was the target of countless lawsuits. \"We were sued so often – once on the grounds that Prouvé wasn't a qualified architect,\" he recalls. The French press initially lambasted the building. \"Paris has its own monster, just like the one in Loch Ness,\" scoffed Le Figaro.\n\n\"One day Richard and I were outside the building, as yet unfinished. We saw a woman struggling with an umbrella that had turned inside out in the wind and Richard rushed over to help fix it. When he mentioned that he was one of the building's architects, she jokily mimicked hitting him with the umbrella as if to suggest he was a naughty scoundrel.\"\n\nYet after the building's opening in 1977, Parisians soon began to appreciate the museum – now one of Paris's most visited public institutions, that ranks behind only the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay in terms of visitor numbers.\n\nIt also inspires architects today. \"The Centre Pompidou, radical on completion, has continued to influence the design of public buildings ever since,\" says Hugh Broughton, founder of London-based Hugh Broughton Architects, who finds qualities in it other than its famously high-tech idiom. \"It's an amazingly brave, generous building whose large public space promotes congregation, street theatre and the highest quality people-watching. Its core concept – open-plan floor plates supported by peripheral structure and services – draws upon medieval principles of castle structures, and combines this with an Arts and Crafts approach that makes a virtue of construction as an aesthetic medium. The result is a building which is dynamic, inviting, egalitarian, transparent and has awesome views – all the best attributes of great architecture. It changed the way a whole generation of architects think about buildings – placing their users at centre stage.\"\n\nCano, Enrico/ RPBW Architects Now one of Europe's most-visited cultural destinations, the Pompidou will undergo a major refurbishment later this year (Credit: Cano, Enrico/ RPBW Architects)\n\nPiano is also known for harnessing light in his projects to ethereal effect, as is the case with the Shard, which can seem to disappear in certain light conditions due to its glass skin. Architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff has said of his works as a whole: \"The serenity of Renzo Piano's best buildings can almost make you believe we live in a civilised world.\"\n\nFor Piano, what is the main architectural legacy of the Pompidou Centre? \"The building is proof that culture doesn't suffer from being more public. It's a place where people gather primarily. It brings together art, life and culture – not culture with a big C but culture with a small c. When it opened, it brought culture to all, and made the city a better place for it.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Here are her top local picks, from brunch at Toast to people watching at the Beltline.\n\nAtlanta – the state capital of Georgia and the unofficial capital of the American South – started its life as a railroad terminus in 1837 and has served as a hub for American culture ever since.\n\nThe SpeciaList Kandi Burruss is an Atlanta born-and-based musician, producer, actor, business owner and reality TV star. She has worked with celebrities like Ariana Grande and Ed Sheeran, and her work on the single No Scrubs earned her a Grammy Award in 1999. She is the owner of Bedroom Kandi, a line of sex toys; Kandi Koated cosmetics; and hosts a podcast called The Business of Pleasure. In addition to appearing on The Real Housewives of Atlanta for 14 seasons, Burruss recently starred in Showtime's The Chi and Hulu's Reasonable Doubt. In 2021, the Atlanta suburb South Fulton declared 18 December Kandi Burruss Tucker Day.\n\nRanking among the top cities for US tourism, Atlanta consistently draws visitors with its dynamic contemporary art scene and iconic soul food, as well as its abundance of greenery and sprawling historic estates. One of the main epicentres of the hip hop industry, it has also secured its place in music history, nurturing a long line of homegrown talent – like Kandi Burruss, the Atlanta-born singer, songwriter, producer and star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\nThe future songstress was raised in the Atlanta suburb of East Point, where she attended Tri-Cities High School of Visual and Performing Arts and met the other members of R&B girl group Xscape; later going on to co-write the 1993 hit No Scrubs for TLC. Burruss joined the Real Housewives of Atlanta cast for its sophomore season in 2010, becoming a fan favourite and one of the longest-tenured housewives before leaving the show in 2024. Her latest venture takes her to New York City as she and her husband, Todd Tucker, co-produce the new Broadway production of Othello at the Barrymore Theatre, starring Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nBut Burruss is an Atlanta girl through and through. \"I was born and raised in Atlanta, so I am Atlanta,\" she says. \"This is home base for me.\"\n\nHer time on Real Housewives allowed her to celebrate her Atlanta roots, and chronicled meeting her husband and the birth of her son, Ace. \"It's been kind of cool to say I can go back and watch 14 years of my life,\" she says. \"It was a great experience.\"\n\nCameras followed Burruss and her co-stars as they crisscrossed the city to attend fashion shows; local restaurants, like 80-year-old Mary Mac's Tea Room; and major landmarks like the Georgia Aquarium, which set the scene for one of the show's beloved end-of-season reunions.\n\nBurruss owns various enterprises in town, including two restaurants and her business camp The Kandi Factory HQ (\"You have to have an invite,\" she says), which put her at the heart of Atlanta's often over-the-top social scene.\n\n\"Atlanta is a vibe,\" she declares. \"It’s a great place for work, fun, and the weather hits all four seasons; it’s such a place to be.\"\n\nHere are Burruss's favourite ways to experience her hometown of Atlanta.\n\nSimon Property Group When Burruss wants to shop the hottest looks, she heads straight to Lenox Square (Credit: Simon Property Group)\n\n1. Best shopping: Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza\n\nIf visitors are looking to drop some major coin, Burruss isn't against hitting up some of the most recognisable spots in Atlanta.\n\n\"People always go to Lenox [Square] or Phipps [Plaza] if they want to shop,\" she says.\n\nBoth malls are in the city's upscale Buckhead neighbourhood and include the designer labels that Burruss and her co-stars wear on the show, like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior. The Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead and the InterContinental Buckhead Altanta hotels, both located nearby, played host to the Real Housewives of Atlanta for various events, like Nene Leakes's wedding in 2013.\n\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/lenox-square/ Address: 3393 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326 Phone: +14042336767 Instagram: @lenoxsqmall\n\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/phipps-plaza Address: 3500 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326 Phone: +14042620992 Instagram: @shopphippsplaza\n\nAlamy Toast, with locations in Atlanta's Midtown and Buckhead neighbourhoods, serves a fashionable New American Brunch (Credit: Alamy)\n\n2. Best brunch: Toast\n\nAnyone looking to refuel after a late night or keep the party going after a big celebration can opt for brunch; another reality TV standby. While Burruss famously doesn't imbibe, she's happy to recommend her favourite spot.\n\n\"If I wanted to get up and go to brunch, it's a place called Toast. They have a great brunch,\" Burruss says of the trendy eatery, found just outside of Atlanta's Buckhead neighbourhood. \"The food is really good.\"\n\nVisitors can feast on \"New American Brunch\" dishes like strawberry-shortcake French toast or fried catfish and grits, while fans of Real Housewives will recognise the restaurant as the spot where Burruss feuded with her co-star Marlo Hampton at Shereé Whitfield's Keepin' it Gucci brunch in 2023.\n\nWebsite: https://www.toastonlenoxatl.com/ Address: 2770 Lenox Rd Suite B-1, Atlanta, GA 30324 Phone: +14047484594 Instagram: @toastonlenox\n\nGetty Images Burruss likes to catch up with her girlfriends over modern Southern dishes and great playlist at Frost Bistro & Bar (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n3. Best place to catch up with your girlfriends: Frost Bistro & Bar\n\nAs Burruss knows, getting a group of girlfriends together is no easy feat. So she looks for venues with good vibes and good music to accompany any tea that might get spilled (gossip) when she and her girls get together.\n\n\"My friend Rasheeda owns a place called Frost Bistro. We might hang out there, because they play good music,\" Burruss says. Fans of reality TV may also remember the restaurant from VH1's Love & Hip Hop Atlanta. Rasheeda and Kirk Frost, who have headlined the show since 2012, opened the casual Southern-style bistro back in 2020, offering a breakfast and brunch menu full of inventive cocktails and modern, stick-to-your-ribs Georgia-style dishes.\n\n\"I like the oxtail and grits, the snapper and the French toast,\" says Burruss.\n\nWebsite: https://frostbistro.com/ Address: 281 Peters St SW, Atlanta, GA 30313 Phone: +14049635495 Instagram: @frostbistro\n\nScott White First-timers to Atlanta should visit the historic Atlantic Station for great dining and views of the city (Credit: Scott White)\n\n4. Best place to bring first-time visitors: Atlantic Station\n\nAtlantic Station is a favourite for locals and tourists, thanks to its views, restaurants and family-friendly attractions.\n\nWhen to come \"The summer is fun,\" says Burruss. \"It’s never just one event; it’s a ton of events. People are out all summer long. It's consistent. That's what I love about Atlanta – there’s always multiple things happening.\"\n\nThe building was once a steel mill and has since been transformed into a collection of boutiques, eateries and apartments. Its location between Atlanta's West Side, Home Park and South Buckhead makes it easy for visitors to get to no matter where they're coming from.\n\n\"You want to go to Atlantic Station. They always have a lot of kids hanging out and playing,\" Burruss says. \"I just took my son and his friends to Skyline Park at Ponce City Market. [They] have great restaurants in that building and on the rooftop is where Skyline Park is. So, you get an amazing view of the city.\"\n\nJust 15 minutes from Atlantic Station, Skyline Park includes a miniature golf course, a three-storey slide, and Heege Tower, which gives riders a 360-degree view of Bucktown, Midtown and downtown Atlanta.\n\nWebsite: https://atlanticstation.com/ Address: 1380 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30363 Phone: +14049007900 Instagram: @atlanticstation\n\nAlamy Once a rail corridor, the Beltline is now a pedestrian-friendly trail that attracts people from all over the city (Credit: Alamy)\n\n5. Best outdoor experience: the Beltline\n\nIn a past life, Atlanta's Beltline was a rail corridor that circled the city. Now, it's a pedestrian-friendly path where Burruss goes to soak up the sun. The star notes that it attracts people from all over the city, making it prime for people-watching. Its trails extend more than 11 miles and notable stops include the Atlanta Beltline Arboretum, The Beacon and Krog Street Market. Public art is on display, too, including rotating exhibitions of sculptures, murals and performances throughout the year.\n\n\"Especially when the weather is good,\" Burrus says. \"That's a fun time, because I like to just walk and people-watch. There's stops along the way where you can eat. In the summer, I like to ride my bike on the Beltline.

But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\n\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\n\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė The fermentation process produces a slightly carbonated drink that's full of \"good\" bacteria (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\n\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\n\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė Kvass is often made with fruit or vegetables, with beetroot being a popular option (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\n\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\n\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\n\nIeva Šidlaitė In Lithuania, traditionalists see gira as a tonic for the common cold (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\n\nWhere to try Gira In Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmyninė, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\n\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\n\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\n\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Above me, more and more stars appear as the sky slowly darkens from blue to violet to navy. Beside me, in her own bathtub, my star-bathing guide Gemma leads a meditation.\n\n\"Allow yourself to be awed by the incredible sky view that you're witnessing,\" she says softly. \"Appreciate that we are here, right now, on this beautiful evening. Focus gently on the sky… and your breath. Just be.\"\n\nI feel cold and self-conscious. I am trying to suspend the part of me that is deeply sceptical because I desperately want an escape from the anxiety that has plagued the past three years of my life. A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing – an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.\n\nStar bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.\n\nSo here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve. There is a strong focus on the healing power of nature here – the 3,000-acre grounds are home to one of the UK's largest rewilding projects – and star bathing is just one of many activities designed to bring guests closer to the natural world.\n\nAnnmarie Whatmough Stargazing at Broughton Sanctuary in the Yorkshire Dales is unique opportunity to connect with nature (Credit: Annmarie Whatmough)\n\nThe meditation ends and silence falls on the moors, broken by the distant hoot of an owl. I look up, trying not to think about the stressful week I've had. As the sky continues to darken, new stars appear as though by magic. My breathing slows. Suddenly I feel something shift. I realise that I am not just looking up at the universe, I am part of the universe. It is impossible not to feel awed by the vastness and beauty of the night sky above me.\n\nExperiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves – Mark Westmoquette\n\nThe psychological benefits of experiencing awe are well documented – it has been proven to lower heart rate, increase the presence of oxytocin and reduce inflammation – and it's one of the reasons that stargazing is so good for our mental health.\n\n\"Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,\" says Mark Westmoquette, an astrophysicist and yoga and meditation teacher who runs mindful stargazing retreats across the UK and Europe. \"As we look up at the night sky and become aware of our place within it, that sense of wonder and awe can really shift our perspective around who and what we are.\"\n\nWhile the mental health benefits of being in nature are well documented, it's only recently that researchers have begun to study the effects of being in a nocturnal natural environment.\n\nTeagan Cunniffe A growing number of spas and retreats around the world offer star bathing packages (Credit: Teagan Cunniffe)\n\nIn February 2024, a new Night Sky Connectedness Index was published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology. It showed that a greater connection to the night sky is positively related to a person's mental health and happiness. The Office of Astronomy for Development, a joint project of the International Astronomical Union and the South African National Research Foundation, is currently researching the potential of using astronomy as a tool to improve vulnerable people's mental wellbeing, with encouraging results.\n\nAt the end of our star-bathing session, Gemma, me and the other two participants drink hot chocolate and then make our way down the hillside. We can't take our eyes off the sky, which becomes more and more dazzling the longer we look at it.\n\nWell World BBC Travel's Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nThe following night, after a day spent exploring the grounds, relaxing in the spa and wild swimming in a freezing cold former reservoir on the estate, I take part in a stargazing session that is part of the annual Dark Skies Festival. After eating a two-course vegetarian meal around a bonfire in the \"fire temple\" – a sheltered wooden structure set in pretty woodland – a group of about 20 of us walk to Broughton's kitchen garden where astronomer Chris Higgins is waiting with a powerful telescope.\n\nHiggins talks us through various constellations and planets, and we take it in turns to look at them through the telescope. I am awestruck by the sight of Venus, which appears like a crescent moon, as well Jupiter with its four moons and its light and dark bands.\n\nTeagan Cunniffe Research suggests that star bathing can calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective (Credit: Teagan Cunniffe)\n\nThe group bonds quickly – our natural reserve seems to disappear as we ooh and aah at the cosmos. It's a freezing night, but no one wants to go inside. It feels like a gift – this clear, beautiful night – and we can't stop staring at the sky. After a while, I let go of trying to understand the science and just gaze up, letting the cool light of the stars calm me. I love the idea that while almost everything on our planet has changed since the beginning of humanity, the beauty of the night sky has remained the same. I am staring up at the same view my ancestors marvelled at, and there is something deeply grounding about that.\n\nI am hooked. When I return home, I start searching for star-bathing retreats. At the top of my wish-list is luxury off-grid retreat centre Bliss & Stars, located two hours from the nearest village in South Africa's Cederberg Wilderness Area. Launched in 2019 by Daria and Heine Rasmussen, it offers three-night star-bathing retreats, featuring guided stargazing sessions, nature immersion, mindfulness, breathwork under the stars and night hikes.\n\nDaria tells me that many visitors have profound experiences gazing at the night sky. \"One guest, numbed by years of trauma, experienced a breakthrough while observing Saturn's rings, describing it as 'awe as exorcism' that rebooted his capacity for joy,\" she says. \"Another guest, a grieving mother, found solace in our wilderness night ventures and naked-eye stargazing, saying: 'It felt like the universe was mourning with me.'\"\n\nAlso high on my bucket list is Chile's Atacama Desert, which features the world's darkest, clearest skies. Elqui Domos Hotel has been designed specifically for appreciating these pristine night skies – it features geodesic rooms with retractable roofs to allow guests to look straight up from their bed. Hotel Ranga in Iceland, meanwhile, features a state-of-the-art observatory, and offers the chance to take part in mindful stargazing from outdoor hot tubs fed by geothermally heated water.\n\nTeagan Cunniffe Bliss & Stars in South Africa's Cederberg Wilderness Area offers star-bathing retreats and guided stargazing sessions (Credit: Teagan Cunniffe)\n\nIn the Scottish Highlands, Cairngorm Excursions runs star-bathing parties, bringing people together for a night of stargazing far from any light pollution, with hot drinks, traditional stovies (a Scottish dish made from meat and potatoes), blankets and log seating. This being Scotland, the evenings also feature a gin, whisky and rum sampling experience put on by a local distillery.\n\nAboriginal Australians are thought to be the world's first astronomers, and a growing number of experiences offer visitors a chance to learn about Indigenous astronomy. Aboriginal-owned Ngurrangga Tours offers an overnight trip in Western Australia's Millstream Chichester National Park with an evening of camping, exploring the wilderness and learning about Indigenous star stories. In Sydney, Fantasea Cruising offers an Aboriginal Sky Dreaming Cruise on the harbour, with an Aboriginal astronomer sharing stories of the Sun, Moon and stars that have been passed down by ancestors.\n\nFor now, I go out into my Bristol garden on clear nights and lie down on a blanket. The sky is nowhere near as dark as it was in Yorkshire, and light pollution obscures many of the stars, but I find that I can still slip into that now familiar sense of peace.\n\nPerhaps it doesn't matter how many stars I can see. As Westmoquette says: \"Even if you can only see one star – that light's been travelling across the universe for hundreds and hundreds of years to hit your eyeball at that precise moment. Against all the odds, you're seeing that ray of light. That means something.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The art curator saving the world's rarest fruit\n\n12 March 2025 Share Save Lucy Lovell Share Save\n\nLucy Lovell (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nFormer Tate Modern director Vicente Todolí founded Todolí Citrus Fundació to preserve rare citrus varieties and compile a catalogue of farming knowledge to inspire future generations.\n\nOur preconceptions of lemons are very rarely challenged. But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todolí is showing me the secret side of citrus – and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\n\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\n\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todolí warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todolí is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\n\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todolí Citrus Fundació, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todolí's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\n\nLucy Lovell Todolí Citrus Fundació is home to more than 500 varieties of citrus (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nNow, Todolí considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todolí Citrus Fundació came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todolí did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\n\nAround the same time, Todolí was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adrià, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todolí asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adrià replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nTodolí was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todolí Citrus Fundació is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todolí is blessed with buckets of it.\n\nLucy Lovell Vicente Todolí was inspired by history's most illustrious citrus gardens (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todolí explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\n\nPlan your trip: Tours cost €15 for adults and €10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todolí Citrus Fundació.\n\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todolí.\n\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todolí Citrus Fundació seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\n\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todolí Citrus Fundació, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todolí cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Tours include an exploratory walk and a tasting of seasonal citrus fruits (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poecítrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\n\nBack on the tour, and Todolí's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\n\nPeople think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago – Vicente Todolí\n\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todolí's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\n\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Buddha's Hand is named for its resemblance to the fingers shown on many Buddha representations (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\n\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon – not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\n\nFor Todolí, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\n\nTodolí can see the art of citrus – and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'Food is a language everyone understands': Yotam Ottolenghi on how cuisine connects people\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Christopher Luu Share Save\n\nNatassja Ebert (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\nThe famed chef and author tells the BBC's Katty Kay that it was finding academia too “esoteric” that led him to seek out a simpler path: to help the world simplify its food.\n\nYotam Ottolenghi's singular style of cooking has been embraced across the globe. Focusing on simple ingredients and treating food as a way to bring friends and family together, he's become a renowned chef, a best-selling author and a touchstone for home cooks looking to incorporate global flavours into their everyday rotations.\n\nThe chef, father and former philosophy student explains to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, in her interview series Influential, that having parents who cooked helped shape his path. However, he says that it was the sense of belonging that came with cooking – not family expectations – that truly drew him in.\n\n\"There was a quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic,\" he says. \"I don't remember having a conversation, which must have happened. 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' I don't remember that.\"\n\nHis parents were both in education – his father, Michael, was a chemistry professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University – but Ottolenghi notes that his folks both had experience in the kitchen.\n\nNatassja Ebert Ottolenghi became a household name after the opening of his restaurant in Notting Hill (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\n\"Food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking. Both my parents were good cooks,\" he says. \"My father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours. My mother was a head teacher at school [...] She also cooked but he cooked even more.\"\n\nThe 56-year-old chef – who has authored 11 cookbooks – tells Kay that rather than having an epiphany about his future path, he saw the kitchen as a space for curiosity and play, something that he's now passed onto his own children.\n\n\"My kids – I've got a 9 year old [and an] 11 year old – they play, you know?\" he says. \"They go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that. I call it cooking as play. So, I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking.\"\n\nFood should be healing rather than routine, says Ottolenghi\n\nBefore making his name in the culinary world, Ottolenghi dabbled in philosophy but found the subject matter too isolating and \"esoteric\".\n\n\"The conversation was being held amongst a group of, like, four people, you know like groundbreaking stuff but actually nobody was participating,\" he said of his time in university, where he tackled topics like the meaning of photography and what images mean to their viewers. Instead of that very specialised field, he turned his focus to something simpler, literally.\n\nNatassja Ebert Ottolenghi says his approach to cooking has changed as he's seen the public's shifting attitudes to food (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\nIn 2018, following the success of his eponymous Notting Hill café and shop, Ottolenghi published his fifth cookbook, Simple, distilling all the techniques and preparations that he'd become known for into something accessible and approachable.\n\n\"Food is a language that everybody understands,\" he says. What surprised him about that, however, was that the books started to eclipse the food. \"Rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Ottolenghi became the dog wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing, almost.\"\n\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay Watch Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on YouTube.\n\nThe books were a way for fans of the restaurant and of Ottolenghi's pared-down, flavour-forward recipes to access that world at home. He tells Kay that he hopes to be part of a movement to take cooking from being a chore into something healing and restorative.\n\n\"Home-style cooking and family-style serving are way more popular now than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all, cost of living, but also Covid. In that moment, we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all other activities that we do all day long that push us.\"\n\nFans soon saw the changes in his books, shifting from the exact recipes served at his restaurants to something less haute cuisine and more streamlined, boasting titles like Simple, Plenty and his latest, Comfort.\n\n\"I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, 'What does it actually mean to cook this recipe?' You know, 'When do I cook – when does one cook it? How much effort goes into it?'\" he says. \"Funnily, from a grand old age talking to younger chefs, I say to them, 'Is someone actually going to cook this?' I want people to cook my food.\"\n\nThat pared-down approach has even turned \"Ottolenghi\" into an adjective – used to describe food that offers high impact with few ingredients and straightforward techniques. He remains humble, brushing off the distinction and putting the focus back on his desire to make cooking comforting.\n\n\"Food really is one of those activities that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that,\" he says.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "Is it healthier to use household cleaning products – or not?\n\n8 hours ago Share Save Jessica Bradley Share Save\n\nSerenity Strull /BBC The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our everyday hygiene habits (Credit: Serenity Strull /BBC)\n\nOur use of cleaning products has increased significantly since Covid-19. But some of the products we're using to clean our homes come with their own health risks.\n\nHumans have been cleaning with chemical agents for around 5,000 years. Ancient Romans' version of the professional cleaner was the \"urine scrubber\", after it was discovered that urine could be used to clean fabrics. Thankfully, we've come a long way since then.\n\nMore recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has changed our everyday hygiene habits, with many people becoming more conscious of potential pathogens in the home.\n\nHousehold cleaning products, including antibacterial spays, promise to kill most of the harmful bacteria in our toilets, on our kitchen surfaces and elsewhere around our homes.\n\nBut there's a growing body of scientific evidence showing that they can also increase our exposure to various harmful chemical air contaminants and particulate matter.\n\nWhat are the risks involved with cleaning our homes regularly – and should we be worried about the products we're using?\n\nUsing household cleaning products is one of the \"modifiable risk factors\" of asthma, says Emilie Pacheco Da Silva, postdoctoral researcher at Inserm, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, where she specialises in the asthma effects of disinfectants and cleaning products.\n\nThis means it's a behaviour that can be changed to lower the risk of developing the condition and experiencing symptoms.\n\nSerenity Strull/ BBC Cleaning sprays can have a harmful effect on respiratory health (Credit: Serenity Strull/ BBC)\n\nScientists, who in 2024 analysed 77 studies looking into the health effects of household cleaning products, concluded that they can have a harmful effect on respiratory health. In particular, cleaning products applied in spray form are suggested to have more harmful effects on the respiratory system than liquids and wipes.\n\nThe scientists found that regular use of cleaning sprays increases the risk of developing asthma, triggering current asthma, and poorly controlled asthma in adults, and wheezing in children.\n\nSpecifically, using sprays between four and seven times a week has been associated with an increased risk of asthma in young adults, and there is some evidence that symptoms worsen with increased use. Researchers say sprays are worse than other types of cleaning products because the chemicals become airborne and therefore it is easier for us to inhale larger amounts.\n\nSome studies the researchers looked at also found a link between exposure to cleaning products during pregnancy and persistent wheezing in early childhood. These products can pose an even greater risk to children, they add, who breathe faster than adults.\n\nOne reason for this is because using cleaning products produces volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can cause ear, nose and throat irritation.\n\n\"There's enough evidence to know that cleaning products are harmful to some people, particularly if they use them a lot. What's harder is which specific chemicals cause damage,\" says Nicola Carslaw, professor of indoor air chemistry at the University of York in the UK.\n\nHowever, there's some evidence suggesting that there's more risk associated with certain chemicals, including chlorine, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, chloramine and sodium hydroxide, as these are corrosive and reactive irritants that, when inhaled, may damage tissues at a cellular level.\n\nWhat about natural and 'green' cleaning products?\n\nIn recent years, there has been a rise in demand for 'natural' household cleaning products, which don't include any synthetic chemicals, and those that purport to be better for the environment.\n\nResearchers concluded in their 2024 review that \"green products\", which contain only biodegradable ingredients, seem to be less harmful than conventional ones, though they say further research is needed to examine their impact on respiratory health.\n\nWhen Pacheco Da Silva realised there were no population studies looking at the impact of \"green\" and homemade products on respiratory health, she analysed data from more than 40,000 people, and asked them about their respiratory health and use of household cleaning products over the previous 12 months.\n\nShe expected the data to show that using household wipes containing disinfectant on a weekly basis would have a harmful effect on asthma, and the use of green and homemade sprays and wipes would be less harmful. She initially saw that weekly use of products in all three categories were associated with asthma.\n\nHowever, when Pacheco Da Silva studied the weekly use of individual product categories while also taking into account people's weekly use of irritants or sprays, the association with asthma disappeared for products branded as \"green\" and homemade products, whereas the use of wipes remained significantly linked with asthma.\n\nThe study indicates that \"the household use of green and homemade products could be less harmful to asthma, but that the use of wipes could be deleterious,\" says Pacheco Da Silva.\n\nHowever, she says, there's no standard definition for \"green\" cleaning products, which may skew the study's findings. Indeed, it is a term commonly misused in marketing slogans (read Isabelle Gerretsen's story on why terms like \"green\" don't always mean what you think). Carslaw adds that \"green\" cleaning sprays aren't necessarily any better for us, though, because our bodies don't know the difference between natural and manmade ingredients.\n\nSprays are worse than other types of cleaning products because the chemicals become airborne\n\nIn one study, Carslaw looked at the chemical reactions that happen when using cleaning products containing natural ingredients. She found that they often contain as many aroma chemicals as regular cleaning products.\n\n\"With a lemon-scented cleaning product, for example, it doesn't matter if the scent is lemon or factory-made, it's the same compound when it's released into the air,\" she says.\n\nThis compound in lemon is limonene, and when it undergoes chemical reactions, it can produce formaldehyde, a known carcinogen.\n\nSome people choose to use homemade cleaning products on the assumption that they're healthier. But while there's some general ideas around what these ingredients can be – water, citric acid, salt, baking soda – there's no official recipe, and there's a lack of information around how active ingredients should safely be used, scientists say.\n\nThere are also concerns among scientists that extensive use of antibacterial cleaning products is contributing to antibiotic resistance, the process whereby bacteria develop defences against antibiotics, which lessens their effectiveness against some infections.\n\nSome studies show that using certain antibacterial products can cause a cross reaction with certain antibiotics, which means you might get a resistance to those antibiotics, which hinders their effectiveness, says Elaine Larson, professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in the US.\n\n\"Eventually we may theoretically reduce the ability of the immune function to respond to an encounter with organisms,\" Larson says.\n\nThis can be explained by the hygiene hypothesis, Larson adds, which argues that the more bacteria, viruses and other microbes children are exposed to at an early age, the better their immune system develops. However, in recent years, there has been some disagreement from scientists about the accuracy of this theory.\n\nGetty Images There's a growing body of evidence that cleaning products may increase our exposure to various harmful contaminants (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nLarson has spent her career dedicated to studying antibacterial resistance, and, in 2007, she carried out a study to address her growing concerns regarding humans' exposure to antimicrobial soaps and household cleaning products.\n\nLarson wanted to see if there was any health benefit when it came to using products labelled as antibacterial. She gave 238 families living in Manhattan products like a kitchen spray and hard-surface cleaner (either antibacterial, or that didn't contain antibacterial ingredients) at random – all commercially available, but with the labels removed. Larson then monitored the participants every week for almost a year and took note of any respiratory viral symptoms they reported (flus, colds, coughs and runny noses).\n\nAt the end of the study, Larson found no difference in respiratory symptoms between the two groups of participants. Ultimately, it didn't seem to matter whether their laundry, bathing and hard-surface cleaners contained antibacterial ingredients or not.\n\n\"This was pretty good evidence that the most important thing is the friction [between the surface and cloth, caused by the action of cleaning], and it doesn't matter so much whether a product [contains something] labelled anti-bacterial,\" she says. Other studies have found that showering and bathing with nonantibacterial soap increases how much skin bacteria is dispersed into the air around us – and Larson is suggesting a similar mechanism may happen when we clean our homes.\n\nOur own 'elbow grease' is at least as effective as the cleaning product we choose\n\nAnd the US Food and Drug Administration advises that it's the motion of handwashing that's most effective, and that there is no conclusive body of research showing that antibacterial soap is any more effective that soap and water.\n\nHowever, Larson concludes in the study that the types of infections most likely to be influenced by household cleaning, such as gastrointestinal disease, may be bacterial in origin – and the products selected in the study didn't claim to have anti-viral properties.\n\nThe reason for this, Larson says, is that antibacterial products don't always deter viruses, which can be airborne and are often the cause of respiratory infections. \"Things on the outside of our bodies are much less likely to cause contamination than breathing in the flu, so antibacterial products aren't affecting the transmission dynamic,\" she says.\n\nHowever, Larson adds, antibacterial products may help with gastrointestinal or bacterial infections, like salmonella, by killing or inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria. She writes in her paper, though, that any potential benefit of using antibacterial cleaning products must be weighed against a theoretical risk for antibiotic resistance. A University of Sheffield study found that \"gentle\" cleansers – those without antibacterial ingredients – can kill \"enveloped\" viruses (viruses with an outer layer) including coronavirus.\n\nSo how should we clean our homes?\n\nScientists don't know the exact mechanisms behind the links between household cleaning products and our health, but the general advice is to minimise our exposure to them, Carslaw says, and only use them as often as we need to.\n\nThe American Lung Association, for example, advises keeping the area well ventilated, and to avoid using irritant ingredients.\n\n\"No one would suggest you stop cleaning, because it's had a massive impact on reducing the amount of diseases we used to get 50 years ago,\" Carslaw says.\n\nHowever, we should always ensure there's good ventilation in the room we're cleaning, such as an open window, Carslaw adds.\n\nAnother way to lower the risk to our health, she says, is to use liquid cleaners rather than sprays.\n\n\"Sprays are effective at converting chemicals in a product into aerosols, which are easier to breathe,\" she says. \"With liquid products, you don't get the same dose.\"\n\nCarslaw also advises cutting down on cleaners that have lots of added fragrances, as this generally increases the likelihood of them containing products that will irritate our airways.\n\nThe consensus is that it's definitely safer to clean our homes than it is to not clean them at all. And with the research indicating that \"green\" or \"natural\" products may also pose certain risks, perhaps we should bear in mind that our own \"elbow grease\" is at least as effective as the cleaning products we choose – since the friction caused when we wipe surfaces helps to lift the bacteria off.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Om Ali: An 'unforgettable' sweet with a sinister history\n\n14 March 2025 Share Save Soumya Gayatri Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs millions of people break their Ramadan fast, many believers around the world reach for a wildly popular dish tied to an unbelievable legend.\n\nOn a hot and sultry August evening in 2011, I sat at a table in my favourite restaurant in Kuwait City, facing the calm waters of the Persian Gulf, waiting for my iftar platter to arrive. The elaborate meal – consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts – was delicious.\n\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\n\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\nSoumya Gayatri The author seeks out Om Ali in every Middle Eastern city she visits (Credit: Soumya Gayatri)\n\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition – the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\n\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\n\nWhere to find Om Ali Although Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Café and Nola Bakery.\n\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is especially popular during Ramadan, and is one of Egypt's most beloved sweets (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\n\nOm Ali, which means \"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\n\nOm Ali was the first wife of the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Shajar Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing Al-Durr, Om Ali instructed her cook to bake something special to commemorate her success and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is rumoured to hark back to the Mamluk dynasty – and a bizarre murder (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\n\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder… I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kitāb nasị̄hạt al-anām fī hụsn al-tạʻām, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\n\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\n\nAlamy Om Ali is also known as Egyptian bread pudding or Egyptian bread roqaq (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil – in this case, the unjust queen.\n\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\n\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\n\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\n\nAlamy The dish provides simple, sugary nourishment to those during Ramadan (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad – a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Mud, water and wood: The system that kept a 1604-year-old city afloat\n\n2 days ago Share Save Anna Bressanin Share Save\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/ BBC (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)\n\nMost modern structures are built to last 50 years or so, but ingenious ancient engineering has kept this watery city afloat for more than 1,600 years – using only wood.\n\nAs any local knows, Venice is an upside-down forest. The city, which turned 1604 years old on March 25, is built on the foundations of millions of short wooden piles, pounded in the ground with their tip facing downwards. These trees – larch, oak, alder, pine, spruce and elm of a length ranging between 3.5m (11.5ft) to less than 1m (3ft) – have been holding up stone palazzos and tall belltowers for centuries, in a true marvel of engineering leveraging the forces of physics and nature.\n\nIn most modern structures, reinforced concrete and steel do the work that this inverted forest has been doing for centuries. But despite their strength, few foundations today could last as long as Venice's. \"Concrete or steel piles are designed [with a guarantee to last] 50 years today,\" says Alexander Puzrin, professor of geomechanics and geosystems engineering at the ETH university in Zurich, Switzerland. \"Of course, they might last longer, but when we build houses and industrial structures, the standard is 50 years of life.\"\n\nBuilding to last Only once, early on in his career, Puzrin has been asked to provide a guarantee of 500 years for a construction a Baháʼí temple in Israel. \"I was kind of shocked because this was unusual,\" he recalls. \"I was really scared, and they wanted me to sign. I called my boss in Tel Aviv, a very experienced, old engineer and I said, 'What are we going to do? They want 500 years.' He answered, '500 years? [pause]. Sign.' None of us is going to be there.\"\n\nThe Venetian piles technique is fascinating for its geometry, its centuries-old resilience, and for its sheer scale. No-one is exactly sure how many millions of piles there are under the city, but there are 14,000 tightly packed wooden poles in the foundations of the Rialto bridge alone, and 10,000 oak trees under the San Marco Basilica, which was built in 832AD.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Venice,\" says Caterina Francesca Izzo, environmental chemistry and cultural heritage professor at the University of Venice. \"Growing up, like everyone else, I knew that underneath the Venetian buildings, there are the trees of Cadore [the mountain region next to Venice]. But I didn't know how these piles were placed, how they were counted and knocked down, nor the fact that the battipali (literally the 'pile hitters') had a very important profession. They even had their own songs. It is fascinating from a technical and technological point of view.\"\n\nThe battipali would hammer down the piles by hand, and they would sing an ancient song to keep the rhythm – a haunting and repetitive melody with lyrics that praise Venice, its republican glory, its Catholic faith, and declare death to the enemy of the time, the Turks. On a more lighthearted note, a Venetian expression still in use today, na testa da bater pai (literally 'a head that is good to pound down the piles') is a colourful way of saying that someone is dull or slow-witted.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/BBC The people who drove the piles into the silt were known as battipali, or pile hitters, and used a song to help them keep the rhythm as they worked (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)\n\nThe piles were stuck as deep as possible, until they couldn't be pounded down any further, starting at the outer edge of the structure and moving towards the centre of the foundations, usually driving nine piles per square metre in a spiral shape. The heads were then sawn to obtain a regular surface, which would lay below sea-level.\n\nTransverse wooden structures – either zatteroni (boards) or madieri (beams) – were placed on top. In the case of the bell towers, these beams or boards were up to 50cm (20in) thick. For other buildings, the dimensions were 20cm (8in) or even less. Oak provided the most resilient wood, but it was also the most precious. (Later on, oak would only be used to build ships – it was too valuable to stick in the mud.) On top of this wooden foundation, workers would place the stone of the building.\n\nThe Republic of Venice soon began protecting its forests to provide sufficient wood for construction, as well as for ships. \"Venice invented sylviculture,\" explains Nicola Macchioni, research director at the institute for bioeconomy at Italy's National Council for Research, referring to the practice of cultivating trees. \"The first official sylviculture document in Italy is indeed from the Magnificent Community of the Fiemme Valley [to the north-west of Venice], dating from 1111AD. It details rules to exploit the woods without depleting them.\"\n\nAccording to Macchioni, these conservation practices must have been in use years before they were written down. \"That explains why the Fiemme Valley is still covered by a lush fir forest today.\" Countries such as England, however, were facing wood shortages by the middle of the 16th Century already, he adds.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/BBC The wooden piles beneath Venice are slowly degrading as anaerobic bacteria attack the cell walls of the wood fibres (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)\n\nVenice is not the only city relying on wooden piles for foundations – but there are key differences that make it unique. Amsterdam is another city partially built on wooden piles – here and in many other northern European cities, they go all the way down until they reach the bedrock, and they work like long columns, or like the legs of a table.\n\n\"Which is fine if the rock is close to the surface,\" says Thomas Leslie, professor of architecture at the University of Illinois. But in many regions, the bedrock is well beyond the reach of a pile. On the shore of Lake Michigan in the US, where Leslie is based, the bedrock could be 100ft (30m) below the surface. \"Finding trees that big is difficult, right? There were stories of Chicago in the 1880s where they tried to drive one tree trunk on top of another, which, as you can imagine ended up not working. Finally, they realised that you could rely on the friction of the soil.\"\n\nThe principle is based on the idea of reinforcing the soil, by sticking in as many piles as possible, raising substantial friction between piles and soil. \"What's clever about that,\" says Leslie, \"is that you're sort of using the physics… The beauty of it is that you're using the fluid nature of the soil to provide resistance to hold the buildings up.\" The technical term for this is hydrostatic pressure, which essentially means that the soil \"grips\" the piles if many are inserted densely in one spot, Leslie says.\n\nIndeed, the Venetian piles work this way – they are too short to reach bedrock, and instead keep the buildings up thanks to friction. But the history of this way of building goes back further still.\n\nThe technique was mentioned by 1st-Century Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius; Romans would use submerged piles to build bridges, which again are close to water. Water gates in China were built with friction piles too. The Aztecs used them in Mexico City, until the Spanish came, tore down the ancient city and built their Catholic cathedral on top, Puzrin notes. \"The Aztecs knew how to build in their environment much better than the Spanish later, who have now huge problems with this metropolitan cathedral [where the floor is sinking unevenly].\"\n\nPuzrin holds a graduate class at ETH that investigates famous geotechnical failures. \"And this is one of these failures. This Mexico City cathedral, and Mexico City in general, is an open-air museum of everything that can go wrong with your foundations.\"\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/BBC The wood, soil and water all combine to provide Venice's foundations with remarkable strength (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)\n\nAfter more than a millennium and a half in the water, Venice's foundations have proved remarkably resilient. They are not, however, immune to damage.\n\nTen years ago, a team from the universities of Padova and Venice (departments ranging from forestry to engineering and cultural heritage) investigated the condition of the city's foundations, starting from the belltower of the Frari Church, built in 1440 on alder piles.\n\nThe Frari belltower has been sinking 1mm (0.04in) a year since its construction, for a total of 60cm (about 24in). Compared with churches and buildings, belltowers have more weight distributed on a smaller surface and therefore sink deeper and faster, \"like a stiletto heel\", says Macchioni, who was part of the team investigating the city’s foundations.\n\nCaterina Francesca Izzo was working on the field, core drilling, collecting and analyzing wood samples from underneath churches, belltowers and from the side of the canals, which were being emptied out and cleaned up at the time. She said that they had to be careful while they were working on the bottom of the dry canal, to avoid the wastewater sporadically gushing from the side pipes.\n\nThe team found that throughout the structures they investigated, the wood was damaged (bad news), but the system of water, mud and wood was keeping it all together (good news).\n\nThey debunked the common belief that the wood underneath the city doesn't rot because it's in an oxygen-free, or anaerobic, condition – bacteria do attack wood, even in absence of oxygen. But bacteria action is much slower than the action of fungi and insects, which operate in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, water fills up the cells that are emptied out by bacteria, allowing wooden piles to maintain their shape. So even if the wooden piles are damaged, the whole system of wood, water and mud is held together under intense pressure, and is kept resilient for centuries.\n\n\"Is there anything to worry about? Yes and no, but we should still consider continuing this type of research,\" says Izzo. Since the sampling 10 years ago, they hadn't collected new ones, mainly because of the logistics involved.\n\nIt's not known for how many more hundreds of years the foundations will last, says Macchioni. \"However, [it will last] as long as the environment remains the same. The foundation system works because it is made of wood, soil and water.\" The soil creates an oxygen-free environment, the water both contributes to that and maintains the shape of the cells, and the wood provides friction. Without one of these three elements, the system collapses.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, wood was completely replaced by cement in foundation construction. In recent years, though, a new trend of building with wood has gained increased interest, including the rise of wooden skyscrapers. \"It's kind of the cool material right now, and for really good reasons,\" comments Leslie. Wood is a carbon sink, it's biodegradable and thanks to its ductility, it's considered among the most earthquake-resistant materials.\n\n\"We can't of course build entire cities on wood nowadays because we are too many on the planet,\" adds Macchioni, but it's undeniable that without artificial materials and without motors, ancient builders just had to be more ingenious. Venice is not the only city with wooden foundations, but it is \"the only one [where the friction technique was used] en masse that is still surviving today and is so insanely beautiful\", adds Puzrin. \"There were people out there who didn't study soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, and yet they produced something we can only dream about producing, which lasted so long. They were amazing, intuitive engineers who did exactly the right thing, taking advantage of all these special conditions.\"\n\n* The illustrations in this story are for artistic purposes only and are not a true representation of the timber pile foundations under Venice, which are tightly packed and do not have branches.\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

Discussions also began on what the contours of a potential deal to reduce them should eventually look like.",

If that’s the goal, though, there are clearly better ways to achieve it.\n\nThe preoccupation with mineral resources is understandable. China dominates the mining and refining of several raw materials needed to produce key building blocks of modern militaries and economies, from semiconductors to radars and electric-vehicle batteries. Efforts to reshore supply chains have made halting progress: Opening new mines and processing facilities is expensive, time-consuming, environmentally fraught and commercially challenging when Chinese companies can raise or lower production to control prices.",

        "content": "New Year’s Eve. Levittown, New York. Word travels swiftly as one young woman tells the next: “You’re on the website.” Dozens of recent high-school graduates are finding out that their photos have been scraped from their social media accounts, manipulated and posted to a porn website.\n\nWho would have done this? And can the women get the images taken down? Told there isn’t much the police or anyone else can do, they set out to catch whoever did this.\n\nAlong the way, they get some help from a global band of investigators and hackers who could take risks that police and prosecutors sometimes couldn't.\n\nLevittown is a real-life horror story for the AI generation. In this six-part series from Bloomberg, Kaleidoscope and iHeartPodcasts, reporters Olivia Carville and Margi Murphy take listeners from quiet suburbs of New York to as far as New Zealand and into the darkest corners of the Internet. Where tech moves faster than the law, and it’s up to everyday people to hold back a rising tide of explicit deepfakes.\n\nUnsafe Online Social media platforms are harming a generation of kids. Our investigations reveal how. Read more\n\n\n\nMe…But Not Me\n\nEpisode 1 Stuck in her childhood home during the pandemic, Kayla is shocked to learn that photos of her, altered to make her look naked, are posted to a website where men swap violent fantasies about women. A conversation with police leaves Kayla discouraged.\n\n‘I’m Also on the Website’\n\nEpisode 2 Months after Kayla’s discovery, dozens of women in Levittown, a New York suburb on Long Island, learn they, too, are subjects of faked porn. Most are recent graduates of the local high school, and they zero in on a culprit. One of them sets out to prove it.\n\nThe Hunter\n\nEpisode 3 It’s not just Levittown. The website hosting the doctored photos is the nexus of campaigns to harass women across the world. A victim in New Zealand helps to spark a global battle against the site and its elusive owner.\n\n‘How Is That Not Illegal’\n\nEpisode 4 An arrest in Levittown kicks off the next phase of an investigation. The central question for the prosecutors is: Is any of this a crime? And they’re on the clock.",

Instead, they encountered dead developers, unfinished condos, and lost their life savings.\n\nHome buyers in Tulum thought they were getting a piece of beachside heaven. Instead, they encountered dead developers, unfinished condos and lost their life savings.\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pitch was perfect. In hindsight, perhaps too perfect.\n\nA one-bedroom apartment with parota wood finishes and granite countertops, just a few minutes from the beach, starting at no more than $200,000. For extra, you’d get boho chic furnishings and decor and sinks carved out of stone. Amenities could include sprawling pools, fire pits, sunrise yoga classes, spas and private bike paths.\n\nAll of it in Tulum, a beach town along the turquoise waters of Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula.\n\n“It’s beautiful, the people are wonderful, the environment’s amazing,” said Erin Norris, who works at a data development center in Austin, Texas. “I decided this is what I want to do. This is my dream home.”\n\nFour years later, Norris’ dream home remains just that. A dream.\n\nErin Norris spent nearly her entire life savings on an apartment in Tulum, Mexico, which never came to fruition. Photographer: Montinique Monroe/Bloomberg\n\nIn 2021, she signed a contract to buy a one-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot condo from Akela Development Group for $191,000.\n\nShe still doesn’t have it, and she likely never will.\n\nThe development firm, for all intents and purposes, disappeared with the $107,000 she put toward the unit — pretty much all of her life savings.\n\nA few months after her initial payment, one of the three partners at Akela was found dead on the beach. By October 2022, the company had told Norris to pause payments while the firm worked out a land dispute. A second Akela partner was found hanging from a rope in August 2024 amid mounting debt, according to a police report. The third is believed to have fled the country.\n\nIn time, Norris would find out that construction had never even started because Akela had allegedly stolen the land it said was theirs. The company was marketing six projects when it disappeared, encompassing 245 units. It only ever delivered one building with 30 units. Two other developments are sitting partially constructed.\n\nThe developer sold at least another 70 presale units — only to never deliver them, according to a conservative estimate by Bloomberg based on dozens of interviews with buyers, their attorneys and reviews of sales pitches and lawsuits.\n\nAkela’s victims aren’t the only ones. Local attorneys say hundreds of other unsuspecting buyers are now caught up in what’s become the dark side of a real estate boom that took off during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWatch the documentary by Bloomberg Originals: Tulum’s Multimillion-Dollar Development Nightmare\n\nA Hot Mess\n\nAt the time, Tulum was so untouched that bright green expanses of jungle spread for miles. That meant land was relatively cheap, not to mention there were few pandemic-related restrictions.\n\nVisitors could lounge in the soft sand or visit ancient Mayan ruins in a lush tropical jungle. And the surrounding town had something for everyone: cafes for digital nomads, dayslong EDM festivals for jungle partygoers, and peace and quiet for snowbirds or retirees. So real estate developers hurried to build other-wordly homes for those who wanted to stay longer.\n\nThe Temple of the God of the Wind, an ancient Mayan ruin, located within the Tulum archaeological park.\n\nBut Tulum’s real estate boom was so quick and so big that it became ripe for disaster. It attracted some serious builders, but it also became a playground for inexperienced companies that got in over their heads, and in some cases, were never able to follow through.\n\nOver the past 10 months, Estrella Rios, a lawyer with a firm in the area, said she has been getting at least two calls a day from new clients who bought pre-construction apartments in Tulum during the pandemic and are now realizing their homes will never be delivered.\n\nMost victims are middle-class foreigners, many of them hoping to use their nest eggs to buy relatively accessible second homes near the beach. Some planned to put their places up on short-term rental websites to help cover their mortgages, as developers often advertised.\n\nMany have now spent tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees and trips down to Tulum to try to understand what happened. But parts of Tulum’s government are so archaic that it’s hard for anyone, let alone a foreigner who doesn’t speak Spanish, to understand how to go about lawsuits and processes that often have to be done in person. They’ve had no choice but to rely on local attorneys who charge them every step of the way.\n\nIn the end, they’ve lost all their money — in some cases their life savings — to builders who vanished.\n\n“Maybe they didn’t set out to defraud people,” Rios said.\n\nTulum is famous for its beaches and music festivals, but much of the city is still a tropical jungle.\n\nStill, some developers had no soil mechanics studies — crucial in this area known for its fragile ground. Others didn’t have adequate planning or construction permits. In some cases, they weren’t above stealing the land they sought to develop.\n\n“But they did have super Instagrammable renderings that looked incredibly pretty and pulled in sales,” she said.\n\nMany thought it was easy to sell apartments with a due date in the future and thought they could deliver, Rios said, before realizing the complicated web of local permits and even corruption that can make construction expensive and lengthy. That led many to run out of funds.\n\nEventually, they didn’t finish construction and some disappeared, she said.\n\n“And that’s when it turns into fraud.”\n\nLand Grab\n\nAs far as Mexican towns go, Tulum is relatively new.\n\nIt became its own municipality in 2008, and in the 2010s, hotels started springing up along the coast and further inland. Tulum’s infrastructure hasn’t kept up with the growing town of 47,000 people. It’s easy to spot shiny new developments sitting on unpaved roads.\n\nTulum gets its name from the Mayan word for wall or fence, and the ruins of the walled city — which predate the arrival of Christopher Columbus — are a popular tourist destination.\n\nThat’s what drew Tara Longwell to the area. Her son, who died in 2019, loved Mayan culture, and all she wanted was to feel close to him.\n\nBy 2021, she decided to purchase a second home there, with the hopes it would be a place for her and her family to heal and find peace.\n\nReports of investors falling prey to real estate scams and apparent frauds had already spread by the time Longwell was considering buying. She and her family own and manage properties in the US, so she felt confident that her experience and due diligence would have prepared her for buying in Tulum.\n\nShe researched Akela’s Solemn Skyview property online and learned that the developer had already delivered at least one other building in the area, Solemn Peaceful — a crucial fact that gave her and many other buyers peace of mind.\n\nShe visited the site and shortly after hired a law firm to handle the paperwork so she could buy a charming three-bedroom unit with a slide that would connect her upper floor to a pool below. She had paid $163,000 toward her $393,500 unit by May 2022 and was told it would be delivered about a year later.\n\n“What actually drew me to investing with them was that they were going to build a home for impoverished families for each unit they sold,” Longwell said in an interview from her home in San Antonio, Texas. “That was all part of their marketing.”\n\nA few months after signing the contract, her lawyer flagged some “irregularities” related to the land Skyview was being built on. It turned out that there was a lawsuit in the works alleging that Akela didn’t actually own the land.\n\nThe complaint was brought on by Liubov Prudkovskaya, a woman with Ukrainian roots who said she had owned the land since 2004. She visited the town two to three times a year. So she bought two lots totaling roughly 2.5 acres with plans to some day build a home and retire there.\n\nWith government offices closed due to the pandemic in 2020, she returned in 2021 to pay property taxes. That’s when she was told the taxes had already been paid by Akela, which she says had forged documents to claim her land as its own with the help of a corrupt network of notaries.\n\n“I went into complete shock,” Prudkovskaya said in an interview in November. “The land was just stolen from me.”\n\nShe and her family have spent the past four years in court trying to get the plot back. The first lawyer she and her family hired suggested taking a payment from Akela in the form of apartments in their projects.\n\n“That meant taking property of land that was most likely also stolen, it was completely illegal,” one of her sons, Emiliano Silva, said in an interview. The family is now on its third lawyer.\n\nEmiliano Silva, the son of a victim of alleged land theft in Tulum, in Mexico City.\n\nPrudkovskaya died in December, amid the yearslong dispute. Her sons hope everything that has happened with Akela might make it easier to get the land back — but that hasn’t been the case, at least not yet.\n\nThe plot currently sits untouched, right in the middle of sprawling development.\n\nNo one related to the development firm, which essentially no longer exists, or the now-deceased or missing founders responded to requests or could be reached for comment. Akela’s office in Playa del Carmen is now a medical spa. When Bloomberg visited in February, the receptionist was aware a real estate firm rented there before but had no further details.\n\nStolen land in the broader state of Quintana Roo has become a prevalent enough problem that a local reporter asked President Claudia Sheinbaum about it during one of her daily press conferences in early December.\n\n“We’ve seen several cases of this kind of fraud for some time,” in the state, Sheinbaum said. Quintana Roo “has a lot of federal land from when it was a territory, before it was a state, and many developers took advantage to take over these federal lands to sell them illegally.”\n\nShe said she had asked Minister of Agrarian, Territorial and Urban Development Edna Vega to work with the state Governor Mara Lezama to look into the matter.\n\nSheinbaum’s office, Lezama, Vega and Tulum’s prosecutor’s office have not replied to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe Developers\n\nJesus Roberto Garza Garcia, born in the northern state of Tamaulipas, founded Akela in 2018. He had two other partners, Ruben Dario Aguilera Negron and Sergio Roberto Lopez Guzman, according to documents filed before the government of Playa del Carmen, a larger town close to Tulum.\n\nIn 2020, the company filed to change its administration. Aguilera and Lopez stepped down from their roles as secretary and treasurer, respectively, according to documents seen by Bloomberg, but remained active in the company. Garza’s son, Jose Roberto Garza Cano, became treasurer.\n\nThey had already delivered Solemn Peaceful, a 30-unit property, by the time some of the prospective buyers at its other developments visited in 2021. And they were seemingly communicative.\n\nSprawling development sits next to low-income communities in Tulum.\n\nEvery month, Shawnie Grant and the other investors at Solemn Lagoon would receive videos that showed how the construction was progressing.\n\nGrant, who thought Tulum would be a good financial opportunity because of the sheer volume of visitors she saw while on vacation there, paid $159,000 toward a $191,000 two-bedroom penthouse in 2021. She said she was careful, especially after learning from another foreign investor to be on the lookout for developers building on stolen land.\n\n“I decided to go through a real estate agency — a big firm,” Grant said. “I thought that I was getting two steps ahead of everything, crossing all of my Ts, dotting all of my Is.”\n\nShe also visited the site of Solemn Lagoon a few times and estimates that the last time she saw the site, the project was nearly halfway done.\n\nAfter some delays, the property was due to be completed in March 2023. The development firm told Grant in February that everything was still on track. When she checked in around the due date, they told her the property wasn’t ready and that one of the developers had been found dead on the beach.\n\n“For him to just say, ‘dead on the beach,’ I immediately had this bad feeling that it must have been some type of foul play,” Grant said.\n\nIn reality, Aguilera had turned up dead on the beach eight months earlier. After going missing for two days, his body was found on the morning of June 6, 2022, according to local media reports and a post on X from the prosecutor’s office.\n\nIn August 2024, Garza’s son found him at home hanging from a rope, according to a police report seen by Bloomberg that called the death a probable suicide. Garza Cano told police that his father had “economic problems because he had lost a great amount of money, so he had become depressed.” Garza Cano couldn’t be reached for comment through relatives or a phone number that belonged to him until recently.\n\nPunta Piedra beach is one of the most central and famous points of the Mayan culture.\n\nAt least two of the company’s victims say they heard through lawyers that the third partner, Lopez, fled Mexico. Multiple calls and messages to him went unanswered.\n\nIt’s unclear how and why Akela’s business model unraveled the way it did.\n\nIn at least two instances, the group allegedly stole the land in which they set out to develop. This was the case with Solemn Skyview, where both Norris and Longwell bought, and Lagoon, where Grant purchased.\n\nThe owner of the Solemn Lagoon land filed a lawsuit that he ended up dropping, according to Grant. She and other buyers believe he was paid off.\n\nSwetank Gupta, a worker at a tech company living in Mexico, has found himself in a similar situation. He had paid about $155,000 toward a $182,000 studio unit in Akela’s Solemn Ocean by May 2023.\n\nAkela sent Gupta emails with construction updates, just as it did with Grant. The last time he heard from the company was in August 2023, four months before the unit’s delayed delivery date.\n\n“I sent my broker to the land and she took photos and nothing,” Gupta said. “It’s still pure land.”\n\nWhen Bloomberg visited the site in February, a large orange sign in front stated the property is under litigation.\n\nOne of Akela’s projects, Solemn Downtown, sits abandoned. A sign says the property is under litigation.\n\nNearby, Solemn Downtown stands nearly complete. A notice from the state prosecutor’s office hangs on the building’s side, stating that Akela is being investigated for fraud. The office didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nLeft with Nothing\n\nNot too far away and some years earlier, Amir Neustdt was building a 50-unit project named Laguna Azul. Renderings show three-story buildings surrounding a lagoon-like pool with greenery all around.\n\nThirty-five people bought units at the development, mostly between 2018 and 2019. Back then, prices were even lower but the promise of paradise was starting to bubble up.\n\nBy the time Martha Cardona paid about $220,000 toward two apartments in 2019, the building was 80% built. With so little work left and only $40,000 left to pay, she felt confident her bet was a good one.\n\n“That, of course, never happened,” Cardona said in an interview from Bogota, Colombia.\n\nThat same year, work stopped and Neustdt told buyers he had run out of money and took out a $1.6 million loan against the development. He said he would use the funds to complete construction.\n\nWhen Neustdt defaulted a year later in May 2020, his creditor, Luis Felipe Alva Hernandez, took control of the construction and finished it. He rebranded the building to Xunic Tulum and re-sold the apartments. The 35 original buyers were left with nothing.\n\nEduardo, who withheld his last name in fear of retribution for speaking out, was one of those original Laguna Azul buyers. He says he personally visited the offices of the creditor, but was never allowed in. Over the phone, he offered to pay for the loan in an attempt to secure back the building for the original buyers, but Alva Hernandez never agreed.\n\nEduardo has brought claims against both the builder and the creditor, in criminal, administrative and commercial courts, all to no avail. A year after filing a lawsuit before a mercantile court in Playa del Carmen, the judge had ruled in favor of Eduardo. Before the sentencing, the judge retracted himself and said the court was not competent to take up the case.\n\nThe criminal and administrative lawsuits are ongoing.\n\nFrancisco Siman is a lawyer representing 17 investors in the Laguna Azul case. Over the past four to five years, he estimates he’s seen more than 100 clients with similar problems in Quintana Roo.\n\n“Sometimes, the seller isn’t the owner of the land, or the property is mortgaged or doesn’t have the necessary permits,” Siman said. “Some developments were never finished, others were finished by committing fraud on the original buyers by selling them again two or three times.”\n\nWalter Piñeiro, a lawyer for Xunic Tulum’s developer, said Neustdt never included the 35 presale buyers in the contract for the $1.6 million loan, meaning the creditor had no legal obligation to respect their previous deposits. So when Neustdt failed to repay, a judge granted full ownership of the project to Alva Hernandez.\n\nNeustdt seemingly changed numbers and has been unreachable. Laguna Azul’s original buyers and their lawyers have been trying to find him for years now. He was active on Facebook as recently as July 2024. But his wife, Estrella Enriquez, is still fairly active. Her feed shows the couple frequently traveling across Europe. It appears they were in Dubai as recently as January.\n\nNeither responded to requests for comment through Facebook messages.\n\n“He cheated my client too,” Piñeiro said, adding they’ve been looking for Neustdt for years. “If you find him, please let us know.”\n\nThe Lucky Ones\n\nInvesting in Tulum wasn’t uniformly devastating. Plenty of people who purchased pre-sale units did eventually take possession of those properties.\n\nJuan Aura is one of those lucky ones. He purchased a 1,000-square-foot unit for about $127,000, and it was delivered in 2020 after a short pandemic-induced delay. Aura started renting it out almost immediately and charged about $250 per night through the end of 2021.\n\nThe unit was usually rented out for the better part of each month, giving Aura more than enough to cover his mortgage at the time, which amounted to about $375 per month.\n\nAura got his unit — but it didn’t pan out exactly as he had hoped. In 2022, the market took a dive. Crowds began to dwindle and supply outpaced demand, driving the promise of Tulum into the ground.\n\nConstruction is still booming in Tulum, but government infrastructure has yet to catch up. Luxury vacation rentals are built on unpaved roads. Photographer: Lisette Poole/Bloomberg\n\nBy the end of the year, Aura was renting the apartment out for just one or two nights a month at $50 per night — a fraction of what he once charged. In 2023, he wasn’t able to rent it out for a single night.\n\n“In one year the entire business died,” said Aura. “The market became a joke.”\n\nStill, he fared better than some others.\n\nNo Recourse\n\nBuyers in both the Akela and Laguna Azul cases say they were blindsided by the developers. But nothing could have prepared them for the nightmare that followed and the many thousands of dollars they would spend trying to get something — anything — back.\n\nIn the aftermath of both cases, many buyers have connected with one another in WhatsApp group chats. They initially leaned on one another for support and to learn about what was happening. But over time they’ve become weary and skeptical.\n\nLongwell says she left a group with about 30 members across all the Akela properties because she felt inundated with information. Grant left a group chat specifically for investors of Solemn Lagoon because she no longer believed she could trust the other members. She wondered if some of them had been paid off.\n\n“It becomes kind of like crabs in a bucket,” Grant said. “We’re all in the same situation, but you’re pulling the next person down so you could possibly get a piece of the same pot before they do it or before the pot runs out.”\n\nSome of the Akela buyers from the US have contacted the FBI in hopes they’ll get involved. They’ve also reached out to multiple local, state and federal agencies to no avail.\n\nMost of them also feel they were let down again by shady lawyers who took their money but failed to help in any way.\n\nAfter it became clear that she wasn’t going to get her unit, Grant began working with a lawyer to file a lawsuit only to learn from another investor that her lawyer used to work for one of the Akela developers years ago. She says she then asked her lawyer about the status of her lawsuit and found out it had never been filed. The lawyer said it was never filed because Mexican courts had been on strike.\n\nLongwell found herself down $40,000 in legal fees and trips to Tulum in addition to what she had paid for the apartment and mired in a court battle with no end in sight.\n\nGupta, after spending close to $25,000 in lawyer fees and trips, says in his case, the land belonged to a third company and Akela was simply developing it. So he hopes there’s a way for him to get some money back eventually.\n\n“Every six weeks I wonder if I should just let it go,” he said. “I’ve decided not to be frustrated except when I talk to my lawyer. That’s when I get frustrated all over again.”\n\nJose Luis Ruiz, a Mexican investor in Laguna Azul, hired lawyer after lawyer to try and get to the bottom of things only to feel that maybe he couldn’t trust his attorney to act in his best interest.\n\n“The administration of law in Tulum is disgusting,” he said in an interview. “Lawyers are threatened, judges hide relevant information from them. We’re left in total helplessness.”\n\nJust like in the Akela case, he says many buyers have left their group chat. For now, he’s still fighting, but understands those who have decided to let go.\n\n“Some don’t want anything more to do with this situation. They want to have karma and God take care of it,” Ruiz said. “And I understand them, I really do. We’ve been knocking on doors for years and we’ve found nothing. It’s truly maddening.”\n\nNorris, meanwhile, is at least trying to hold out hope.\n\n“I do still one day want to live in Mexico. This hasn’t soured me on the country,” she said. “I know I’ll get there someday. It’s just going to take me a lot longer now.”",

        "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — Two violent earthquakes rocked Southeast Asia on Friday, causing buildings in the Thai capital Bangkok to sway and collapse and prompting evacuations across the city, as well as in neighboring Myanmar. Bangkok police say a high-rise building under construction collapsed when a 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit the Thai capital midday on Friday, and possible casualties are not yet known.\n\nA dramatic video circulated on social media showed the multi-story building with a crane on top collapsing into a cloud of dust, while onlookers screamed and ran.\n\nPolice told The Associated Press they were responding to the scene near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak Market, and had no immediate information on how many workers were on the site at the time of the collapse.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey and Germany’s GFZ center for geosciences said the midday temblor was a shallow 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), with an epicenter in Myanmar, according to preliminary reports.\n\nA second quake, with a magnitude of 6.4, shook the area 12 minutes later.\n\nWater from high-rise rooftop pools in Bangkok sloshed over the side as they shook, and debris fell from many buildings.\n\nA video posted on social media right after the quake showed an apartment building under construction collapsing, but it was not immediately possible to verify its authenticity.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties and Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra called an emergency meeting to assess the impact of the quake.\n\nThe greater Bangkok area is home to more than 17 million people, many of whom live in high-rise apartments.\n\nAlarms went off in buildings as the earthquake hit around 1:30 p.m., and startled residents were evacuated down staircases of high-rise condominiums and hotels in densely populated central Bangkok.\n\nThey remained in the streets, seeking shade from the midday sun in the minutes after the quake.\n\nThailand’s Department of Disaster Preventaion said the quake was felt in amost all regions of the country.\n\nThe epicenter of the earthquake was in central Myanmar, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the city of Monywa.\n\nIn the capital Naypyitaw, the quake damaged religious shrines, sending parts toppling to the ground, and some homes.\n\nFurther reports of damage were not immediately available from Myanmar, which is embroiled in a civil war.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.",

        "content": "Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem met with far-left President of Colombia Gustavo Petro and other local government officials in Bogotá on Thursday evening to discuss security, the fight against drug trafficking, migration, and the repatriation of illegal Colombian migrants in the United States.\n\nNoem is conducting a three-day tour of El Salvador, Colombia, and Mexico. The DHS Secretary arrived in Bogotá after travelling to El Salvador, where she visited the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT) “mega-prison” and met with President Nayib Bukele.\n\nThe Colombian presidency announced that during Noem’s visit, both countries signed a declaration of intent for biometric cooperation which will allow for a more efficient exchange of biometric data to identify criminals and prevent their transit across borders. The Colombian presidency pointed out that the cooperation between Colombia and the U.S. has resulted in over 1,700 deportations and over 1,000 arrests, “strengthening joint efforts in security and immigration control” and consolidating the “cooperation that has united Colombia and the United States for more than 200 years.”\n\n“With Mrs. Kristi Noem, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security. We talked at length about homeland security. I think she loved Colombia,” Petro wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhile Noem and Petro’s meeting was conducted behind closed doors, unnamed Colombian presidential palace sources confirmed to the local newspaper El Espectador that both sides discussed the issue of the fight against drug trafficking and the possibility that the United States will take away Colombia’s certification in this matter.\n\nAccording to El Espectator, the U.S. delegation insisted the amount of hectares producing coca leaf plantations is worrisome, while the Petro administration insisted on not reactivating fumigations and rescuing its initiative to have coca leaf growers voluntarily replace their crops. Coca leaves are the main ingredient used in the production of cocaine. Petro’s policies have resulted in record amounts of cocaine produced in Colombia in more than two decades as of 2023.\n\nHours before Noem’s meeting with Petro, the DHS Secretary met with Colombia’s Foreign Minister Laura Sarabia and signed the letter of intent of the Biometric Data Exchange Program. Noem referred to Sarabia as “her friend” and reaffirmed the joint work on trafficking, migration and organized crime issues.\n\n“I saw the beautiful flowers, your spectacular coffee. And I hope, because you are going to see me many more times here, to continue working together with the Colombians because of the importance of your work, ensuring that we are going to face security issues together,” Secretary Noem said. “Thank you very, very much Laura, my friend, for everything that has been done.”\n\nSarabia, for her part, highlighted “an honest, frank and friendly dialogue that seeks to further strengthen the ties of cooperation between the two countries and the guarantee of the human rights of our nationals.”\n\n“I really appreciate your visit to the country, your frank and honest dialogue and that we can have a conversation between women and that we can move forward on the issues that concern both countries,” Sarabia said.\n\n“This letter of intent is one more step to be able to establish specific, realistic and effective measures that guarantee at the same time the consolidation of our friendly relationship with the United States and the guarantee that the human rights and dignity of migrants are effectively respected,” she added.\n\nNoem’s visit to Colombia comes roughly two months after President Gustavo Petro caused a short-lived diplomatic crisis between Colombia and the United States in January after he abruptly refused to accept a U.S. deportation flight of Colombian migrants. At the time, President Donald Trump responded to Petro’s actions with a barrage of retaliatory measures that Petro responded to in a long, incoherent Twitter rant. Hours later, the Colombian government announced that it had “agreed to all” of President Trump’s terms.\n\nDHS Secretary Noem will travel to Mexico on Friday to meet with President Claudia Sheinbaum and Foreign Minister Juan Ramon De La Fuente.\n\nChristian K.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) – King Charles III was briefly hospitalized for observation on Thursday after experiencing “temporary side effects” related to a scheduled cancer treatment, Buckingham Palace said in a statement.\n\nHis engagements for Thursday afternoon and Friday were canceled.\n\n“His majesty has now returned to Clarence House and as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow’s diary program will also be rescheduled,” the palace said. “His majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result.”\n\nThe king’s health has been closely watched ever since early last year when he announced that he had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Charles, 76, stepped away from public duties for about three months but continued fulfilling state duties, such as reviewing government papers and meeting with the prime minister.\n\nCharles’ cancer diagnosis has heaped pressure on the British monarchy, which is still evolving after the 70-year reign of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nWhen he succeeded his mother in September 2022, Charles´ task was to demonstrate that the 1,000-year-old institution remains relevant in a modern nation whose citizens come from all corners of the globe. But this task takes much time and energy.\n\nAlthough the duties of a constitutional monarch are largely ceremonial, the royal whirl can be exhausting. Besides the occasional procession in full royal regalia, there are meetings with political leaders, dedication ceremonies and events honoring the accomplishments of British citizens. That added up to 161 days of royal engagements during Charles´s first year on the throne.\n\nCharles’ illness came as his daughter-in-law, Kate, the Princess of Wales, was also diagnosed with cancer. Kate, the wife of Prince William, took more than six months off before returning to public duties in late September.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) on Friday proposed legislation that would abolish the renewable fuel standard (RFS), believing it has only harmed the environment and raised gas prices.\n\nThe Keystone State conservative unveiled the Eliminating the RFS and Its Destructive Outcomes Act, which he believes may help relieve inflationary pressure of gas prices.\n\n“Eliminating the RFS is a vital step in preserving these essential jobs and reducing inflationary pressures,” Perry said in a written statement to Breitbart News. “By removing this mandate, we can curb the rising costs that are stretching household budgets to their limits.”\n\n“While the RFS was intended to foster the use of environmentally friendly fuels, the environmental benefits of ethanol, particularly in replacing gasoline, are highly questionable. When evaluating the full environmental impact of increased corn production – including the water, land, and energy resources required – it becomes clear that the RFS has produced net negative environmental consequences,” he continued.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has noted that Congress created the RFS to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, expand the renewable fuels sector, while reducing reliance on imported oil.\n\nThe RFS program requires a certain volume of renewable fuel to be used to replace the quantity of fossil fuels in transportation fuel, home heating, or jet fuel.\n\nHowever, Perry’s office has argued the RFS has failed to reducing dependence on foreign oil and promoting environmentally-friendly fuel alternatives.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation has noted how the use of corn-based ethanol in gasoline has only raised feed prices for cattle and poultry farmers and diverts valuable farmland from other agricultural uses:\n\n“Once hailing biofuels as an important tool to mitigate climate change, the U.N.’s 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report acknowledged that biofuel policy negatively impacts the lives of the poor, diverts land to produce biofuels, has adverse environmental and climate consequences,” the Heritage Foundation wrote in another paper.\n\nUsing ethanol in gasoline also tends to contain about 30 percent less energy per unit volume than gasoline, may contain more fuel containments than gasoline, and may even damage small engines and older cars.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s new acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba said political prosecutors and judges are part of a “broken system” that must be reformed.\n\nDuring an interview with Habba on Thursday’s edition of The Alex Marlow Show podcast, Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow highlighted Habba’s whirlwind rise inside Trump world and her time in the West Wing during what Habba called “probably the most epic first 100 days ever.”\n\nHabba described some of the highlights during her experience as Trump’s attorney since joining his legal team in the autumn of 2021.\n\n“Beating Michael Cohen was probably the sweetest victory,” Habba told Marlow.\n\nShe said Cohen “is somebody who had the opportunity to do great things and instead got tied up in a mess of his own with his taxi medallions, et cetera, and then tried to come after President Trump.”\n\nCohen’s work with the government led to “the very public raids, the indictments” against Trump, Habba said, adding that she believes her stalwart representation of Trump in that case is “why I think he asked me to take on this new role.”\n\nShe explained that her mission in her new role as a U.S. Attorney will be focused on fighting crime.\n\n“My mission is going to be the same as President Trump’s,” she said. “We’ve got to get crime off the streets. We have to be hard on crime. We have to take care of the immigration problem that the Biden administration created, get illegal immigrants out. And also, for me, in my time at the White House, I was very focused on human trafficking.”\n\nShe added that “violent crime is, of course, going to be a priority. We want our streets safe.”\n\nMarlow noted that Habba is best known for her work defending Trump in the case brought against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James regarding allegations that Trump had undervalued his properties for loan and tax purposes.\n\nHowever, there was “no victim” in that alleged crime, Habba explained, “and they used a commercial law, section 6312, which is not supposed to be used in the private sector.”\n\nHabba said James had “decided to butt her nose into a private sector, into a private company, into Deutsche Bank, who lost no money – made money – and was paid early; and for years and years and years, she tried to build a case. She couldn’t build a case with the normal rules and laws, so she used section 6312.”\n\nThe case is being appealed, but Habba warned that these lawfare tactics employed by James could become the new normal.\n\n“If you can do this to President Trump, then you can do this to anybody,” she cautioned, echoing Trump’s campaign message.\n\nHabba also noted that the date of one of Trump’s alleged crimes took place past the statute of limitations, but the state passed legislation to change the statute.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed into law the Adult Survivors Act to grant sexual abuse victims a one-year window to file law suits against their alleged attacker even if the statute of limitations had passed.\n\n“There’s Gov. Hochul who created the Adult Survivors Act side by side with [Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll’s lawyer] Robbie Kaplan to target people for one year, and who was their first person? It was Donald Trump,” Habba said.\n\nThat kind of political lawfare from non-political officials must end, she believes.\n\n“Stepping in as a [U.S. Attorney], I can say that it’s not a political position. It is a law and order position,” Habba told Marlow. “And when you make it political, when you run on getting Trump, when you start creating laws that avoid statute of limitations to get a political opponent, that is the single most un-American thing, and a real destruction of the judicial system.”\n\nHabba said she is “as frustrated as most Americans” that those who weaponized the legal system against Trump have not faced any consequences for it. She believes this needs to be rectified.\n\n“Watching consistent congressional testimony or hearings and then not seeing anything happen, that’s where the enforcement offices need to step in and do their own investigations and then instruct the men in blue to arrest people,” she said. “And I see all the tweets, all the frustration — ‘Why aren’t we arresting people? Why aren’t we arresting people?’ We have to do that because we can’t keep having investigations and no outcome of accountability.”\n\nIn addition to overzealous and overtly political prosecutors, Habba sees broader problems with the system as well.\n\n“We’ve got a real problem on the bench,” Habba said of political judges, adding that government officials who decide “what evidence goes in and out of court, what records you can and cannot make, as I know it, can completely ruin or destroy or change what the jury can see, what they can’t see. Those decisions are so critical.”\n\nShe called for reforms to the rules and ethics governing the officials who make these decisions.\n\n“Start focusing on the enforcers of the law, the people that are truly the decision makers and that can really ruin somebody’s life financially, putting them in jail, things like that,” she said. “You can’t take that and mix politics into that.”\n\nMarlow brought up the example of District Judge James Boasberg, who blocked Trump’s deportation flights of gang members and is now handling the Signal group chat lawsuit. Boasberg and his wife are prominent Democrat donors. “Just seems too crazy to be true,” Marlow said.\n\nThat’s just one example of the biased judges she and Trump have faced, Habba said, arguing that Congress, which created the court system, has the power to change or even defund it.\n\n“Don’t forget that we fund these federal courts, and if it comes to it, we will play ball with you, just like you’re playing with us,” she said. “There’s separation of powers for a reason. It’s checks and balances. It’s all those things. But this isn’t over.”\n\nThe Alex Marlow Show, hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, is a weekday podcast produced by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

        "content": "On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “OutFront,” Hawaii Gov. Josh Green (D) reacted to Novak Djokovic playing tennis with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by stating, “Novak, go play tennis, hit a 160 mph serve, but stay out of public health. And I hope someone hits him with an overhead and shows him what it means to hurt somebody,” and “go back to the tennis court, definitely good luck at Wimbledon, stay out of public health.”\n\nHost Erin Burnett asked, “So, Novak Djokovic, the tennis star, just appeared with RFK on a tennis court together. Djokovic, of course, during COVID, wasn’t even able to play in one of the tournaments because he refused to get the COVID vaccine, right? Couldn’t play in the U.S. Open. It was an Australian Open issue. And now, here they are together. When you look at these cuts now, 25% of HHS, what does that mean for something like vaccines, even, in your state, in the state of Hawaii?”\n\nGreen responded, “It’ll be harder. We have vaccine hesitancy, especially in rural communities. I love to play tennis. I was a competitive tennis player when I was young. But Novak hanging out with RFK, while good for cardiovascular health, won’t do anything to prevent the spread of AIDS with good public health advice. It won’t do anything to help parents keep their kids from getting deadly meningitis if they don’t get their vaccines. This is this kind of B.S. distraction which we expected from a guy who took the job for celebrity reasons. It is catastrophic for our healthcare system to have RFK there. And shame on Novak for cozying up to this guy. Novak, go play tennis, hit a 160 mph serve, but stay out of public health. And I hope someone hits him with an overhead and shows him what it means to hurt somebody, because that’s what it’s going to be for all these kids that don’t get vaccinated. And for all the parents that have to deal with the consequences of this vitamin A overdose. These are real issues, and these clowns are not public health people. So, go back to the tennis court, definitely good luck at Wimbledon, stay out of public health.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Italy’s conservative Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni warns that many European leaders are being too “instinctive” in their responses to President Donald Trump, never stopping to think whether he may have a point when he speaks.\n\nGiorgia Meloni, the only European government leader invited to the inauguration of President Donald Trump this year, warns her fellow leaders on the continent are failing to be pragmatic and serve their nations’ best interests when interacting with the U.S.. Further, while many react with outrage if not horror when the Trump White House criticises Europe, there is never time to reflect on what truths those comments contain.\n\nVice President JD Vance, who has been something of an emissary to Europe from President Trump, has been very critical of European member states at times, pointing to their backsliding on freedom of speech and democracy. While EU nations generally consider themselves the global guardians of these virtues, in fact the continent has become markedly more censorious of late, and legacy political parties have gone to extraordinary lengths to keep newcomers and populists out of power, no matter their levels of popular support.\n\nPM Meloni responded to these remarks of the Vice President in comments to Britain’s Financial Times, a rare interview with a non-Italian newspaper, and said the remarks had been misunderstood by most, and should not be dismissed. She told the paper: “I have to say I agree… I’ve been saying this for years . . . Europe has a bit lost itself.”\n\nAnd regular Europeans shouldn’t feel affronted by Trump’s comments, she said, for they are not in his sights. Rather the “ruling class” and their approach to power which means rather than finding answers to the problems voters identify, they instead “impose” an ideology on them, is what the Trump White House criticises.\n\nEuropean leaders, Meloni said, are “a bit too political” in their attitudes to Trump and aren’t pragmatic enough. She continued: “Sometimes I have the impression that we simply respond instinctively… In these topics you have to say, ‘Keep calm, guys. Let’s think’.” This is simply a matter of defending national interests, she said.\n\nWhile the media and non-government politicians remain in a 2017 mindset when it comes to President Trump’s second term, those parties in power in a handful of European countries have begun to take a more pragmatic approach to Trump and, in a small number of cases, even admit his White House can “have a point” on some issues. Denmark’s left-wing Prime Minister Mette Fredricksen, for instance, acknowledged JD Vance was onto something when he said in his famous Munich Security Conference speech that mass migration to Europe had become a serious security issue.\n\nShe said: “Security is also about what is going on in your local community… No matter if you look at statistics on crimes or if you look at problems on the labour market, insecurity in local communities, it is the most vulnerable who experience the consequences.”\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it is also a left-wing government willing to take U.S. criticism on the chin. Responding to alleged ‘Signal’ chat leaks of comments made by Vice President Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth about the European NATO states being pathetic freeloaders, the UK defence minister reflected: “The Americans have got a case, the Americans have absolutely got a case that on defence spending, on European security, on our support for Ukraine”.",

I make a dark joke that it’s like the worst ‘Handmaid’s’ episode ever, where June [Elisabeth Moss’ character] is about to be executed and she turns to the camera and says, ‘I heard they’re really incompetent, right?’” … “We need to meet this moment, and June is a fundamental thing we have to remember in this moment, which is, despair is a luxury that our children cannot afford … Racism is not going away, misogyny is not going to go away, religious harm is not going to go away, and I find something really inspiring for this moment about what is the core of June Osborne.”\n\nWhat was the middle thing again?\n\nThe whole point of Handsmaid Tale is a world where women are forced to carry and give birth to babies that are not their babies. Instead, the babies are the property of the ruling class. Uhm, other than same-sex couples who take advantage of women desperate for money, no one else is doing this that I’m aware of.\n\n“Yeah, I think we just started out trying to make good television show and … then along came our 45th president and went into a whole other world,” writer and producer Warren Littlefield added. “We became more than a television show, we became a symbol of the resistance and a fight for human rights. As we try to continue to do a good television show and also feel the responsibility and the weight of what impact we have in the world.”\n\nHe added: “And so, that is something that I don’t ever think I’ve ever found in my lifetime, and I cherish it. It’s an honor.”\n\nI’m not Googling “Warren Littlefield.”\n\nHere President Trump is aggressively shrinking the size of the federal government, just as aggressively seeking world peace, and above all, he’s returning control of institutions like education to the states, and these morons are screaming about fascism and dystopia.\n\nDo you want to know why people enjoy feeling oppressed? It’s for the same reason people love to pretend they are offended. Because it’s an easy way to feel superior over the one you are accusing of oppressing you. If you are oppressed, you automatically assume the moral high ground. Of course, if you can claim to be oppressed when you’re not, that’s the best of both worlds: you convince yourself you are morally superior when you are not oppressed at all. That’s a win-win.\n\nI thought about watching Handsmaid Tale, but it sounds stupid.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

        "title": "Breitbart Business Digest: The Hypocrisy of VATs and Free Trade",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "VATs Are Weapons in the Trade War\n\nThe free trade consensus is quick to denounce tariffs. We’re told tariffs are bad because they raise consumer prices. They are a tax on consumers. They cause an inflationary supply shock. This orthodoxy insists that tariffs are damaging by their very nature, and that their primary effect is to harm the very consumers they purport to protect.\n\nBut here’s where things get interesting: introduce a Value-Added Tax (VAT) into the mix, and the entire calculus changes. VATs are not just tolerated by the free trade crowd; they are often praised. But what exactly is a VAT? It’s a tax applied to domestic consumption that raises prices on a much broader array of goods than any tariff ever could. It’s a tax that hits everything from bread and milk to automobiles and appliances.\n\nForeign VATs are particularly harmful to U.S. exports, imposing additional costs that make American goods less competitive in international markets. In the European Union (EU), member countries apply standard VAT rates to imported goods, including those from the United States. These rates vary across the EU, with Hungary imposing the highest standard rate at 27 percent, followed by countries like Denmark, Sweden, and Croatia at 25 percent. Germany, a key trading partner for the U.S., maintains a standard VAT rate of 19 percent.\n\nChina, another major destination for U.S. exports, employs a tiered VAT system. The standard VAT rate is 13 percent, applicable to most goods, while reduced rates of nine percent and six percent apply to specific categories of products and services. For instance, the nine percent rate covers sectors such as transportation and construction, whereas the six percent rate pertains to financial and consulting services.\n\nThese VATs are levied on the final sale of goods within these countries, meaning U.S. products are subject to these taxes upon entry, effectively increasing their retail prices. This taxation structure can disadvantage American exporters, as their products become more expensive compared to local goods, potentially leading to decreased demand and contributing to trade imbalances.\n\nWorse, the VAT is designed in a way that explicitly favors exports over domestic consumption. Countries that rely heavily on VATs, like those in Europe and increasingly China, rebate the tax on goods that are exported while imposing it on imports. The result is a system that encourages exports and discourages imports, fueling trade imbalances.\n\nBy reimbursing domestic producers for VATs paid on exported goods while taxing foreign goods entering the market, VATs act as a tool of industrial policy. They incentivize production for export markets, providing a structural advantage to foreign producers at the expense of American manufacturers. This is not free trade; it is state-sponsored protectionism masquerading as market efficiency.\n\nVATs are Worse For Consumers Than Tariffs\n\nYet when Trump and his supporters propose to counter VATs with tariffs, the free traders act as if a trade war is being launched. But a VAT is nothing more than a tariff with an additional tax on sales of domestically produced goods.\n\nIt’s also important to note that the inflationary effects of VATs are far more widespread than those of tariffs. A tariff on specific imports may raise prices on a narrow selection of goods. A VAT, however, is levied on virtually every step of the production process, contributing to price increases at multiple stages.\n\nSo, why do free trade advocates find tariffs abhorrent while celebrating VATs as efficient? Because they’ve accepted the global norm where foreign mercantilism is repackaged as sound policy. The hypocrisy is blatant.\n\nIf tariffs are to be condemned for raising consumer prices and creating inflationary supply shocks, then VATs deserve the same treatment. Instead, we see a deliberate blind spot — one that serves the interests of export-driven economies at the expense of American workers and producers.\n\nFree traders should recognize that a tariff is nothing more than a VAT with an exemption for domestic producers. In this sense, a tariff is a tax cut when compared to the alternative of a VAT.\n\nTrump’s approach, which acknowledges the role of tariffs in countering this mercantilism, is at least rooted in reality. It understands that trade policy isn’t about purity but about achieving fairness. And as long as our trading partners continue to use VATs to their advantage, the United States must be willing to respond in kind.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who assumed the position this month with no mandate after radical leftist predecessor Justin Trudeau resigned, announced in an angry speech on Thursday that, under his watch, the traditionally friendly American-Canadian relationship was “over.”\n\nCarney, who is running to keep his position in a general election scheduled for April 28, blamed President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian imports for the deterioration in ties, announcing that it was time for Canada’s economy to decouple from America and find prosperity elsewhere.\n\nHe did not specify exactly what partners he hoped to fill the gargantuan void that the United States would leave in the Canadian economy, as the nation’s top trade partner, if he cut ties.\n\n“We will need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States,” he emphasized. “We will need to pivot our trade relationships elsewhere.”\n\n“There will be no turning back,” he asserted.\n\nCarney made clear that he did not seek only economic decoupling from America, mentioning military cooperation as a field where he hoped to cut ties with Washington. Canada is an American ally through the NATO partnership, one routinely identified as among the most negligent and least prepared for war of the NATO community.\n\n“Over the coming weeks, months, and years, we must fundamentally reimagine our economy,” Carney told Canadians. “We will need to ensure Canada can succeed in a drastically different world. The old relationship we had with the U.S. based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military co-operation is over.”\n\nCarney claimed the move was necessary because America “is no longer a reliable partner.”\n\n“We won’t back down. We will respond forcefully. Nothing is off the table to defend our workers and our country,” he added.\n\nCarney’s remarks triggered significant alarm on social media, where Canadians wondered if ending cordial relations with America would result in economic and political suicide. The speech also raised questions about Carney’s perception of the United States as a political outsider.\n\nIf That’s How You Want It, Buddy! New Canadian PM Declares Special Relationship with U.S. “Over”\n\nCarney never held any other public office before becoming prime minister this month and spent most of his career in the financial shadows, leading the Bank of Canada and Bank of England. He also featured as a prominent shadow adviser to Trudeau on issues such as climate alarmism and the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCarney nonetheless accused President Trump of attempting to “break” Canada to colonize it.\n\n“I reject any attempts to weaken Canada. To wear us down, to break us so that America can own us. That will never happen. And our response to these latest tariffs is to fight, to protect, and to build,” he asserted in remarks shared by his campaign.\n\nCarney’s campaign has focused on linking the rival Conservative Party to Trump, who he is prominently campaigning against. Trump himself, however, has expressed no fondness for Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and said in a recent interview with Fox News that he would prefer Carney remain prime minister.\n\n“The Conservative that’s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don’t know him, but he said negative things. So, when he says negative things, I couldn’t care less,” Trump said. “I think it’s easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal … I’d rather deal with a Liberal.”\n\nNotably absent from Carney’s recent remarks were similar criticisms of Canada’s relationship with China. While Trump has imposed some tariffs on Canadian goods in response to the Trudeau administration’s catastrophic failure in securing the countries’ mutual border, China launched a trade war with Canada this year, imposing tariffs on over $2 billion in Canadian goods this month.\n\nUnlike America, China has also admitted to the brutal slaughter of Canadian citizens – at least four in 2025 – accused of nebulous alleged “drug-related” crimes. Carney’s government issued a mild criticism of the execution of its citizens but has not taken any concrete actions in response. Beijing, in turn, has accused Canada of attempting to violate Chinese sovereignty by requesting that China not kill its citizens.\n\nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) warned shortly after the campaign season began this month that China is a top foreign interference threat in the election, alongside India, whose relations with Canada deteriorated prominently under Trudeau. Carney’s Liberal Party has attempted to accuse the Conservative Party and its leader Pierre Poilievre of benefitting from Indian election interference, claims Poilievre has rejected, yet Carney has not encountered at press time any meaningful pressure on his potential ties to China, save for Poilievre questioning his relationship with the Communist Party.\n\nPoilievre on Tuesday highlighted Carney’s role at a private firm, Brookfield Asset Management, before abruptly becoming an unelected prime minister. Brookfield reportedly secured a massive $276-million loan from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) as recently as November, reportedly intended to help secure Brookfield’s control of real estate assets in Shanghai.\n\n“What did Mr. Carney, in his role as Trudeau’s economic advisor, offer to China?” Poilievre asked in remarks on Tuesday.\n\n“How do we know (Carney’s) not going to act against our interests in favour of his financial interest? Why didn’t he stand in front of a microphone and confess to Canadians that he owes the Chinese Government that kind of money?” Poilievre continued.\n\nCarney has not explained his role in that loan, or addressed concerns about foreign interference, since the Conservatives raised the issue.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration is investigating the State of California over a law signed by Gavin Newsom last year that bars school districts from adopting policies requiring schools to notify parents if children want to change genders.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last July, Newsom signed the law after several conservative school districts enacted policies requiring schools to notify parents. The issue arose out of concern that schools were encouraging students to change their genders, and were hiding those transitions from parents, ostensibly because of students’ privacy rights.\n\nPolls show the vast majority of Californians agree parents have the right to know if children want to change gender.\n\nBreitbart News had confronted Newsom about the issue in the spin room at the Republican presidential primary debate in 2023, and he had tried to avoid an answer by claiming that the transgender issue was a marginal one:\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Department of Education announced that it was investigating California over the issue:\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Student Privacy Policy Office (SPPO) launched an investigation into the California Department of Education (CDE) for alleged violations of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA gives parents the right to access their children’s educational data. The California Department of Education has allegedly abdicated the responsibilities FERPA imposes due to a new California state law that prohibits school personnel from disclosing a child’s “gender identity” to that child’s parent. SPPO has reason to believe that numerous local educational agencies (LEAs) in California may be violating FERPA to socially transition children at school while hiding minors’ “gender identity” from parents. Given the number of LEAs that appear to be involved, SPPO is concerned that CDE played a role, either directly or indirectly, in the widespread adoption of these practices, which appear to be required by the recently enacted California Assembly Bill 1955. … FERPA is a federal privacy law enforced by the Department’s SPPO. FERPA gives parents the right to access their children’s education records, the right to request record corrections or amendments, and the right to control, with important exceptions, disclosure of personally identifiable information in education records.\n\nNewsom has tried to walk back some of his extreme positions on the transgender issue, recently telling conservative Charlie Kirk that biological men should not be able to play in women’s sports — a position at odds with state policy.\n\nJoel B.

        "content": "Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) blasted the Chattanooga Times Free Press Thursday for reaching out to comment to her about a “sham townhall” that was organized by — and will be hosted by — radical left activists.\n\n“It is absurd that the @TimesFreePress would reach out requesting comment on a sham ‘townhall’ that is being organized by radical left wing activists without disclosing that one of the organizers is a former reporter at the same outlet,” the Tennessee senator wrote.\n\nShe added, “Political stunts like these are why trust in the media is at an all-time low.”\n\nA reporter from the Times Free Press reached out to Blackburn’s team asking if Blackburn plans to attend the town hall hosted by Democracy in Action, a leftist organizing group. The reporter noted that Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) were also invited.\n\nThe local outlet published its piece on Friday, portraying the event as a “town hall” for Blackburn, Fleischmann, and Hagerty, even though none of the lawmakers mentioned would attend the town hall, raising the question if the event is a town hall at all.\n\nThe Times Free Press claims that event is organized by Democracy in Action, a “nonpartisan” group, even though Allison Gorman, the event’s organizer, was an unsuccessful Democrat candidate for the Tennessee House of Representatives.\n\nThe local outlet did disclose in the piece that Judy Walton, a former reporter and editor at the Times Free Press, is one of the many organizers for the Democracy in Action town hall. However, the reporter did not disclose this in the comment request to Blackburn’s office.\n\nDemocracy in Action has held weekly protests about their elected officials, the Times Free Press wrote; however, the protests are thinly veiled leftist critiques of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nBlackburn frequently engages with her constituents, and highlighted her constituent casework, mail requests answered, county tours, and much more. Blackburn’s office calls every county for town halls.\n\nThe outlet proceeded to quote Jack Allen, a Democrat who ran against Fleischmann for his congressional seat, who will be moderating the allegedly “nonpartisan” event.\n\nGorman then claimed she did not hear about a tele-town hall with Blackburn or she would have attended.\n\nFleischmann’s Communications Director Justin Doil said in a statement:\n\nCongressman Fleischmann always meets and talks with constituents, small business owners and employees, community groups, faith-based groups, activists and local media when he is not in Washington D.C. and enjoys the productive conversations he has with his constituents from Chattanooga to Oak Ridge about how best to represent East Tennessee’s values and priorities in Congress.\n\nA Hagerty spokesperson said that Hagerty has traveled across the state to meet with constituents from all walks of life.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have accused many of the leftist protestors who have shown up at town halls and have erupted across many Republican districts of being “paid” by Democrats. To Blackburn’s office, this appears to be yet another such incident.\n\n“Radical left-wing activists and their accomplices in the media are using sham town halls to generate fake media coverage critical of President Trump and Republican lawmakers. These diehard liberals do not care about actually engaging with their elected officials,” a Blackburn spokesman told Breitbart News. “What they are seeking to do is create a media spectacle to push their Marxist ideology. Republicans will not be used as pawns to advance their left-wing agenda.”",

Images of buckled and cracked roads in Mandalay and damaged highways as well as the collapse of a bridge and dam raised further concerns about how rescuers would even reach some areas in a country already enduring a widespread humanitarian crisis,” the article continued.\n\nMeanwhile, video footage showed a high-rise building in Bangkok appearing to sway back and forth as people were heard screaming in the background.

        "content": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that as many as 300 foreign students have had their visas revoked due to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nRubio confirmed the number of revoked visas when speaking at a press conference in Guyana.\n\n“Maybe more, it might be more than 300 at this point,” Rubio said. “We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.”\n\nRubio said he hopes the numbers rise as time goes on.\n\n“I hope at some point we run out because we have gotten rid of all of them, but we’re looking every day for these lunatics that are tearing things up,” he said.\n\nThe policy of revoking visas stems from President Trump’s January 20 Executive Order, which says the following:\n\nIt is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\n\nAs noted by Politico, Rubio commented on the visas being revoked while responding to questions about Rumeysa Ozturk, “a Tufts University doctoral student and Fulbright scholar from Turkey who had her student visa revoked this week.”\n\n“A viral video reposted online by officials from the State Department showed Ozturk — who co-wrote an op-ed in a student newspaper criticizing Tufts’ response to the protests — being detained on the street by plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement near the Tufts campus,” noted the outlet.\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. “Better than Killers of the Flower Moon,” wrote Mark Judge. “You haven’t seen a story like this before,” wrote Christian Toto.

Voter ID. Great. One day voting and paper ballots. Do you agree with all four of these? And would Congress need to get involved to make these — all four of these happen?” he asked.\n\n“Yes and yes, I agree with the policy on all four of those,” Lee responded. “I think we need that. It’s one of the reasons why I introduced the SAVE Act to the Senate last year, along with my House counterpart sponsor, Chip Roy.”\n\nHe said this year, they are introducing a “beefed up” version of the SAVE Act.\n\n“But bottom line, we got to make sure that people voting in the United States, in federal elections are, in fact, U.S. citizens, and for a variety of reasons, existing federal law as interpreted by the Supreme Court, not only doesn’t it require that, but it almost prohibits it, perversely,” Lee said.\n\n“And I also believe this likely does require legislation in order to stick,” he added.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.",

        "content": "Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky predicts the death of Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin “soon”, stating the invasion of his country would then have to end.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine could not survive the death of the country’s head of state, Ukraine’s President Zelensky has told French television. This will happen soon, he said, asserting he would outlive the Russian leader.\n\nVictory in the Ukraine war is simply a matter of out-waiting Russia, Zelensky told Eurovision News, and if America allows Russia to return to the global fold now it would hand Putin victory at “one of the most dangerous moments”.\n\nHe said: “He will die soon, that’s a fact, and everything will be over. This may all end before then… I’m younger than Putin, so put your bets on me. My prospects are better.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BreitbartLondon/status/1758901391274262895\n\nThe remarks speak to the European perspective on the war, that if it can be sustained just a little bit longer Ukraine will inevitably win. This perspective is predicated on the view that Russia, while outwardly strong on the battlefield, is essentially hollow and prone to collapsing at any moment.\n\nRepeated claims have been made about Putin’s health over the course of the war, with assertions that he has a range of diseases from Parkinson’s to Cancer. At 72 years old, anything is possible, but these claims have been made without hard evidence so far.\n\nIt is not the first time President Zelensky has directly linked the outcome of the war to the death of President Putin. Breitbart News reported in 2022, in the very early days of the conflict, that Zelensky was speaking in interview to David Letterman, who asked the Ukrainian leader: “Let’s just say that Putin got a really bad cold and died… would this [the invasion] continue?”.\n\nThen as now, Zelensky made clear his view that Russia’s government is one that relies on, presumably, Putin’s force of personality and if he personally were removed from the equation then Russia would suddenly and fundementally change. He said in 2022: “No. There would be no war… when such a person is gone, institutions come to a halt.\n\n“That’s what happened back in the Soviet Union. Everything collapsed. And that’s why I think if he’s gone, it will be hard for them. They will have to deal with their internal policy rather than foreign issues.”",

        "title": "AfD Blasts 'Conservatives' for Abandoning Migration Plan After Election",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Alternative for Germany leader Alice Weidel has accused the supposedly conservative Christian Democrats of abandoning their promises of clamping down on migration following the election.\n\nAhead of last month’s federal elections in Germany, Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz attempted to shed the party’s association with open borders under ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel and cast himself as an immigration hardliner who would finally stem the tide of the mass influx of foreigners into the country over the past decade.\n\nHowever, having boxed himself into working with the pro-mass migration, election-losing Social Democrats (SPD) after ruling out a coalition with the right-wing AfD, Merz has been forced to cede ground to the left on a myriad of issues in negotiations to form the next government in Berlin.\n\nThis comes despite Merz and the CDU symbolically breaking the so-called “cordon sanitaire” firewall around working with the AfD in any regard by joining hands with the anti-mass migration party in January to pass a ‘five point plan’ calling for increased efforts to prevent illegal immigration, step up deportations, and other migration controls in the wake of multiple terror attacks in Germany by alleged asylum seekers.\n\nYet, the tough stance apparently only lasted until the election, with Merz already conceding ground to the leftist SPD on key areas, including on border controls, and to commit to keeping in place reforms from the previous Social Democrat-run government, such as continuing to allow dual citizenship for non-EU migrants and the reduction in time required to obtain citizenship.\n\nOn Wednesday, AfD co-leader Alice Weidel remarked: “According to the current status of coalition negotiations, there will be no changes to migration and naturalization policy. Turbo naturalization will continue, and borders will remain open. Nothing remains of Merz’s five-point plan.”\n\nIn addition to caving on migration, the likely incoming chancellor also quickly reversed on government spending after winning the election. Despite running as a fiscal conservative and vowing to uphold the “debt brake” constitutional limit on government borrowing, Merz ushered through a bill this month to pave the way for a trillion euro spending package.\n\nThis was done during an emergency session of the outgoing parliament to avoid the AfD from being able to block the legislation with its newly won seats in the Bundestag.\n\nWhile Merz justified lifting the debt brake to allow for badly needed investments in the German armed forces, he had to concede hundreds of billions in additional spending on infrastructure and climate initiatives to secure the votes of the SPD and the Greens.\n\nThe AfD, which opposed the bill, argued that it would impoverish future generations of Germans and could threaten the stability of the euro and financial markets across Europe.\n\nThe flip-flopping from Merz has done no favours for his standing with the German public. Even with his government yet to be formed, the likely chancellor has seen support for his party steadily decline since last month’s elections. According to the most recent survey from RTL and NTV, Merz’s Union fell another point over the past week to 26 per cent, down from the 28.5 per cent won at the February elections.\n\nConversely, the Alternative for Germany has seen its support steadily rise since the vote, climbing to an all-time high recorded by the pollsters at 23 per cent.",

Trump border czar Tom Homan warned that he was going to Boston and “bringing hell with me.”\n\n“I meant it. I said it,” Homan said during a March 8 appearance on Breitbart News Saturday. “So when I say I’m coming to Boston, bringing hell with me, yeah, I’m bringing hell to illegal aliens that raped children.”\n\n“Someone who sexually assaulted a child is the worst of the worst of the worst. So yeah, I’m going to Boston. I’m bringing hell with me,” he warned, adding, “I’m bringing hell to every illegal alien who commits a serious offense in this country, especially those who attack our most innocent, our children.”\n\nWATCH — “I’m Bringing Hell with Me”: Homan to Anti-ICE Boston Police Commissioner:\n\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu (D) has continued to battle the administration, asserting that Boston “stand[s] with immigrants.” But Homan, indeed, traveled to Boston and oversaw 380 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests, which included members of MS-13, Tren de Aragua, Trinitarios, and more.\n\n“ICE had to find and arrest these illegal alien rapists because Massachusetts and Boston are sanctuaries that refuse to cooperate with ICE,” Homan said on X, blasting the sanctuary city.\n\n“They would rather release these animals back into the community rather than honor ICE detainers or notify ICE when they are scheduled to be released,” he continued, noting that a “majority” of the 370 arrested were “significant” criminals, including child sexual predators.\n\n“These arrests included 6 foreign fugitives, including four who were wanted for murder or to serve a criminal sentence for murder, along with drug traffickers, child sexual predators and numerous other violent public safety threats,” Homan continued.\n\nThe update comes as Democrats continue to go all in on sanctuary policies as the Trump administration looks to expand ICE detention space for criminal illegals.",

This attack constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and poses a direct threat to the civilians of the State of Israel. The State of Lebanon bears responsibility for upholding the agreement. A short while ago, the IDF struck a terrorist infrastructure site used to store UAVs by Hezbollah’s Aerial Unit (127) in the area of Dahieh, a key Hezbollah terrorist stronghold in Beirut. The Hezbollah terrorist organization systematically embeds its terrorist infrastructure amidst the Lebanese civilian population, a clear example of Hezbollah’s cynical exploitation of Lebanese civilians as human shields. The IDF issued advance warnings to the civilian population in the area. The IDF will continue operating in order to remove any threat to the civilians of the State of Israel. Over the past few hours, the IDF struck Hezbollah command centers, terrorist infrastructure sites, launchers, and terrorists in southern Lebanon. The projectile attack from Lebanon toward the Upper Galilee area in northern Israel this morning (Friday), constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and poses a direct threat to the civilians of the State of Israel. The State of Lebanon bears responsibility for upholding the agreement. The IDF will operate in order to remove any threat to the civilians of the State of Israel.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added (translated from Hebrew by the Government Press Office):\n\nWhoever has not yet internalized the new situation in Lebanon, has received an additional reminder of our determination. The equation has changed; what prevailed before October 7th will not recur. We will not allow firing at our communities, not even a trickle. We will continue to strongly enforce the ceasefire. We will attack anywhere in Lebanon against any threat to the State of Israel. We will ensure that all of our residents of the north will return safely to their homes.\n\nThe renewed rocket fire came as Israel and Lebanon took steps toward formal peace and normalization, though many leaders in Lebanon have publicly opposed such steps.\n\nJoel B.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), a fellow Texan, saying Cruz needed “to be knocked over the head.”\n\nCruz said Crockett’s rhetoric was indicative of a Democratic Party lacking a message beyond “rage and hatred.”\n\n“Senator Cruz, how do you respond to a Democratic congresswoman suggesting you should be knocked over the head?” fill-in host Kayleigh McEnany asked.\n\n“Look, I don’t know her,” Cruz replied. “She’s a congresswoman from Dallas. I’ve never met her. As far as I can tell, she’s never done anything in the House of Representatives, other than scream obscenities. But I’ll say it’s sad. It’s really sad that this is where the Democrat Party is. You know, you were talking a minute ago in your last segment about how the Democrat Party, they’re floundering, that they don’t stand for anything other than rage and hatred. They hate Donald Trump. They hate Elon Musk, that they’re now the party of violence. She’s happily calling for violence. You know what? We see death threats across the board. By the way, Donald Trump had two assassination attempts and that kind of rhetoric is it plays into it.”\n\nHe continued, “You know, this — it is unfortunate to see the rage — we’re seeing right now domestic terrorism directed at Tesla dealerships with radical leftists coming in with Molotov cocktails, bombs. We had bombs in an Austin Tesla dealership, firing guns. Somebody’s going to get killed and at some point, the Democrat Party needs to stop being out of their minds, like when I was first elected 13 years ago to the Senate, there was such a thing as moderate Democrats.

        "content": "Fresh off the release of the mega viral song “Fingerprints,” Singer/songwriter Jon Kahn went on Steve Bannon’s WarRoom to discuss how his walk with God began, the evolution of the song, and how trials, tribulations, and a season of loss inspired its release.\n\nKahn took Bannon to the beginning of his walk with God, explaining how five years ago, in a conversation about life with Nashville songwriter Michael Farren, the son of a Baptist preacher, ended with Farren telling Kahn, “You know, you talk like a Christian.” Kahn, who wasn’t exposed to faith or religion growing up in Los Angeles, said he asked Farren what that meant. “You have a seekers heart,” Farren replied, “I can tell that you’re yearning for something more.”\n\n“So, I tucked that away,” Kahn said. “I started having more conversations with people about God and faith. I started going to church for the first time in my life. And I liked what that did for me. I like the idea of holding myself accountable to something greater than myself.”\n\nKahn told Bannon how he started noticing “interesting things” happening in his life. “People came back into my life who I hadn’t seen in years,” Kahn explained. “An ex-girlfriend of mine, who’s a screenwriter, I hadn’t spoken to her in fifteen years. She says, ‘I’m writing a script about faith and I want you to read it.'”\n\nThose conversations about faith kept happening. The interesting events kept occurring. And just as Kahn was noticing how his life was changing, a close friend said to him, “I’ve never seen God chase anybody like he’s chasing you. He’s got his fingerprints all over you.”\n\nKahn says he “tucked that away and thought, that’s the name of a song.”\n\n“Fingerprints,” Kahn says, “was originally about my exploration of faith and the journey I was on. It’s been ready for about a year and a half. And then I wrote “Fighter” and that took precedence. I didn’t release ‘Fingerprints’ because I was so new to faith. I didn’t want to go into an area where I felt like I was treading where I didn’t belong. And in the many conversations I had with people, they said you wouldn’t have those words to the song unless God wanted you to.”\n\nNow, years into his faith journey and a year and a half after writing “Fingerprints,” Kahn would weather a season of immense loss.\n\n“After I wrote the song, I had a series of really rough times,” he told Bannon. “I had a breakup with a girlfriend, my mom passed away. My dad fell, had surgery. And then my house burned down.”\n\nBannon wondered if the hardships, loss of a loved one, and the fire rattled Kahn’s newfound faith and had him wondering if “maybe there isn’t a God. Or God would have not done this to me if He was a fair God.”\n\n“I didn’t think that,” Kahn said. “I had a strange peace about it.”\n\n“I spent six weeks on my dad’s sofa,” Kahn recalled, in the immediate aftermath of the Palisades fire that completely destroyed his home. “My dad is not a believer. He and I weren’t always very close. We’ve gotten close in the last couple years. He’s 93-years-old now. About four weeks after the fire, I was still trying to process what happened. Every time I would say to him, ‘I’m going to church on Sunday or I’m going to church right now,’ he was very accepting of it. But there was always this little bit of ‘Really, you’re going to church?'”\n\n“So there was always a little bit of a push-and-pull,” Kahn said. “One day I walked in his bedroom and said ‘you know, I don’t think I could be handling this situation as well as I am had I not gone down this road of faith. And he looked at me, at 93-years-old, and he said ‘I 100 percent agree with you.’ Which I thought was a pretty big moment for him and for me.”\n\n“I never lost faith and I always had a peace that things were going to work out,” Kahn said. “And I thought what better time to release a song like this than in the middle of a storm.”\n\nBannon asked if Kahn has lost friends after finding faith, or if there are now people or situations he finds himself avoiding.\n\n“I got to know a Navy SEAL,” Kahn recalled, “And I asked him ‘when you’re on patrol in Afghanistan or wherever you are, are you always looking for the bad things?’ And he said ‘no, I’m always looking for the beautiful things.’ And I said ‘why is that?’ He says ‘when you look for the beautiful things, all the bad things stand out.'”\n\n“That story really stuck with me,” Kahn said. “So when you’re on a journey like this, you look for the good. It makes you able to identify the energy you don’t want to be around, the people that you don’t want to be around who might not be on the same journey. I don’t think I’ve lost friends as much as I’ve gained a lot of friends from this process. And met so many amazing and kind people through it.”\n\nOn the heels of the Billboard Digital Sales chart-topping success of “Fighter” and now with the immediate viral impact and positive reaction to “Fingerprints,” Bannon asked Kahn what the future holds.\n\n“I’m trying to pick up the pieces after the fire. I’m going to relocate to Nashville, hang there for six months. I write a lot of music there,” Kahn explained.\n\n“I’ve got a buddy named Jeffrey Steele, who’s in the Nashville Hall of Fame, he’s an amazing writer,” Kahn said. “He always says ‘Just write what’s in your heart.’ So there are certain things I get inspired to write about. Usually they’re kind of tough situations. I’m going to keep sitting down at the piano and picking up the guitar and see what comes to me.”\n\n“I love ‘Fighter’ and I love this,” Bannon said. “‘Fingerprints’ is going to be a big hit.”\n\n“‘Fingerprints’ has been praised and promoted by John Rich, Sean Hannity, and Ric Grenell, among many others. This week, Scott Stapp, the front man for the rock band Creed, called “Fingerprints” “a gift” and said “I feel the divine in this song. I feel God.”",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has been hammering “Big Law” — the massive law firms that have indirectly subsidized the Democrats’ “lawfare” campaign against him, and that have encouraged lawyers to provide pro bono (free) work for the left.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump issued an executive order targeting Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP after it hired former Manhattan prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, who had orchestrated the persecution of Trump in the Stormy Daniels case.\n\nTrump also noted that “a Paul Weiss partner and former leading prosecutor in the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller brought a pro bono suit” against January 6 defendants. Trump added:\n\nGlobal law firms have for years played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles. Many have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections. Additionally, they have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono, or ostensibly “for the public good” — potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all. My Administration will no longer support taxpayer funds sponsoring such harm.\n\nTrump suspended the firm’s security clearances and ordered federal contractors to end any business with it. He also flagged the firm’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies.\n\nPaul, Weiss soon capitulated, agreeing to provide $40 million in pro bono work for administration-friendly causes, committing to allow attorneys to work for politically conservative clients, and ending the firm’s DEI policies.\n\n“Lawyers abandon the profession’s highest ideals when they engage in partisan decision-making, and betray the ethical obligation to represent those who are unpopular or disfavored in a particular environment,” Trump noted.\n\nTrump had already targeted Perkins Coie, the Democrat-aligned firm responsible for hiring Fusion GPS on behalf of the Hillary Clinton (secretly, and in violation of federal campaign finance rules) to produce the so-called “Russia dossier” by former British spy Christopher Steele, a forgery that led to the years-long “Russia collusion” hoax.\n\nThis week, he expanded his executive orders to include Jenner & Block, which hired “collusion” prosecutor Andrew Weissman after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation ended in failure; and also included WilmerHale, another firm that has hired Mueller prosecutors and that has taken up a variety of causes favored by Democrats.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these firms also fold. But they are finally facing the cost of their partisan behavior.\n\n“Big Law” sits at the apex of a political pyramid that has served, until now, to institutionalize the power of the Democratic Party in American society.\n\nWhile Democrats used frivolous Bar complaints to target lawyers and firms that dared to represent Trump, Democrat-aligned firms raked in business and enjoyed proximity to government power. Pro bono programs also allowed left-wing lawyers to continue the activism of their student days on the job.\n\nCritics of the president claim that he is abusing his power to target his political opponents. The opposite is true: he is restoring balance and justice, allowing conservative attorneys and clients — as well as conservative law students — the same rights and opportunities that liberals have enjoyed.\n\nWhile elite law schools are still, for now, dens of conformity, Big Law is getting a long-overdue reality check from Trump that will, hopefully, spread change throughout the system.\n\nJoel B.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk is reportedly planning to open a 24-hour Tesla diner in Hollywood, which will include a drive-in theater charging station. Leftists are having a meltdown in response, including turning their ire on a prominent restaurant owner who said Musk’s plan is “exciting.”\n\nThe establishment is meant to be a place where Tesla drivers can engage in leisure activities while stopping to charge their electric vehicles, according to a report by ABC 7 News. Musk is moving forward with his plans even as Tesla facilities have become the target of massive protests and domestic terrorism attacks.\n\nWhile an official opening date has not been announced, Musk is reportedly trying to recruit high-profile chefs to provide food at his 24-hour Tesla diner. The leftist outrage against Musk and anyone who dares to support his latest idea has been swift.\n\nFor example, Walter Manzke — who owns the famed Los Angeles restaurant République with his wife, Margarita — is facing backlash after expressing his and Margarita’s apparent support for the SpaceX CEO’s endeavors, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nManzke was quoted in a recent New York Times article reacting to Musk’s Tesla café plans, saying, “It sounds exciting.”\n\nThe restaurant owner also suggested his wife is a fan of Musk, adding, “She told me the other day that she wants to buy a Tesla, so I can tell you what side she’s on.”\n\nManzke’s remarks sparked outrage among some République patrons, who apparently have strong negative opinions about Musk in the wake of his support for President Donald Trump and his work in leading the current administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with rooting out wasteful government spending.\n\nSomeone running the restaurant’s social media also took to République’s Instagram account to issue a statement countering the owner’s implied political support for Musk.\n\n“At République, we believe in focusing on what we do best — creating exceptional food and a welcoming experience for all our guests,” an employee of the French bistro wrote. “In response to a recent New York Times article, we want to clarify that the quote about possibly buying a Tesla was simply about exploring electric vehicle options, not a political statement.”\n\n“We value innovation and sustainability, and we respect all viewpoints,” the statement continued, adding, “République does not take political stances; we are here to create a space for everyone, no matter their background or beliefs.”\n\nThe post, however, was quickly deleted, Los Angeles Times noted.\n\nThe outlet also pointed out that République is a cornerstone of the Los Angeles dining scene, frequently topping “best of” lists, and oftentimes ranking in the top 10 in the city’s “101 Best Restaurants” list since it opened in 2014.\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "The debate over E-Verify is heating up among Idaho Republicans as they battle over a bill that would require employers use the federal E-Verify database to exclude illegal migrants from jobs.\n\nA long article by Investigate West reveals two Idaho Republicans in particular who are coming at the debate over illegals from opposite camps.\n\nOne, Idaho state Rep. Stephanie Mickelson, opposed the draft law requiring employers to use the E-Verify system. And the second, Ada County GOP vice chair Ryan Spoon, is a supporter of E-Verify to put an end to businesses hiring illegal aliens.\n\nThe article notes that Spoon targeted his fellow Republican for allegedly hiring illegals for her business, Mickelsen Farms.\n\nEarly in the Trump administration, Spoon used social media to urge his followers to report Mickelson for allegedly hiring illegals for her farm. Almost immediately ICE raided Mickelson Farms and one illegal alien was reportedly arrested.\n\n“Americans across a broad spectrum of politics are really fed up with the illegal immigration issue,” Spoon said. “The tone has definitely changed there, and people’s willingness to confront that issue has changed.”\n\nMickelsen, though, claims that she has heard from other legislators who have quietly told her that they are unhappy with Spoon’s very overt and public tactics against her. She says that they have told her behind the scenes that they are “disgusted” by Spoon’s tactics.\n\nShe also plied the commonly heard line pushed by employers who want to hire illegals because Americans “don’t like to do farming jobs.”\n\nRegardless, Mickelsen has voted for some of the immigration measures Spoon and his more hardline fellow Republicans support.\n\nMickelsen and her family also claim that they don’t support hiring illegals. But her critics argue that opposition to E-Verify is a contradiction for any Republican, and that supporting E-Verify would help ensure that illegals aren’t hired by employers who do not want to verify bogus claims of legality.\n\nIdaho is not the only place this debate between Republicans is occurring. Several states are finding GOP lawmakers at loggerheads as some work to implement President Trump’s agenda, while others seek to slow walk immigration reform in response to the pleas from the business community to safeguard their ability to hire cheap migrant labor.\n\nRepublicans in Montana, Wyoming, and Oklahoma, for instance are also slowing down immigration reform or trying to find ways to limit ICE to detaining only criminal illegals and leaving illegal workers alone.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, X at WTHuston, or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Concerns over the breakdown of social cohesion, increasing violence, and the rise of Islamism have reached an “unprecedented level” in France, according to a survey which found over four in ten believe the country is heading towards civil war.\n\nA survey from Ifop published in Le Figaro to coincide with the 120th anniversary of the passing of the Secularism Act of 1905 and the 10th anniversary of the Bataclan Islamist terror attacks in Paris in 2015, has found that the French public is increasingly sceptical of the multicultural project foisted upon the nation, with many fearing that their society may devolve into full-on chaos.\n\nAccording to the poll, a record eight in ten people in France believe the country is at risk of experiencing a “social explosion” in the coming months.\n\nWhile the “explosion” could come in the form of riots such as the ones experienced in 2023 following the police killing of an Algerian-heritage teen, or like the Yellow Vest or farmers’ protest movements, a staggering 42 per cent are concerned that it could come in the form of an outright civil war. The survey also found 39 per cent could envision an attack on the Élysée Palace (the residence of the French president) or the National Assembly.\n\nIn any event, the French public appears to be losing faith in their public institutions’ ability to withstand the growing turmoil, with six in ten expressing doubt over the government’s ability to maintain stability in the country. This comes as the National Assembly remains mired in a three-way split and in the wake of three governments collapsing since the start of last year.\n\nOne of the key drivers of the growing feeling of instability found by the survey was the spread of Islamist ideology throughout France. The poll found that 72 per cent were concerned about growing Islamism in working-class neighbourhoods, 70 per cent about it in prisons, 63 per cent in schools, 56 per cent in universities, and 52 per cent in sports clubs.\n\nIslam in general was by far seen as the religion most likely to harbour radical positions at 63 per cent, compared to Judaism at 23 per cent and Catholicism at 16 per cent.\n\nWhile the public was mostly tolerant towards some practices of the Muslim faith, such as praying five times a day and abstaining from alcohol, others, such as forcing young girls to wear veils or refusing to shake the hand of a person of the opposite sex, are seen as signs of radicalisation.\n\nOther major factors seen as contributing to the breakdown in social cohesion surrounded issues of multiculturalism, with 88 per cent citing the “evolution of delinquency” on the streets of France, 82 per cent the “concentration of populations of the same culture or origin in neighbourhoods,” and 75 per cent pointing to the public spaces becoming “occupied by religions”. Outside of multiculturalism, only income inequality, at 77 per ent, was seen as playing a meaningful role in the cultural decay.\n\nThe growing concern over Islamism and multiculturalism appears to be having an impact on the political sphere. According to the survey, over eight in ten see the far-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party of Jean-Luc Mélenchon as contributing to societal divisions.\n\nPerhaps influencing this perception, supporters of the LFI, which has been an outspoken proponent of Gaza in the conflict with Israel, were the most likely to hold a positive perspective on radical Islam, with 36 per cent saying they would support Islamism.\n\nConversely, while the legacy media and the political establishment have long attempted to deride the National Rally as divisive and outside the bounds of acceptable politics, 39 percent of the public now sees Marine Le Pen’s anti-mass migration party as beneficial to France’s cohesion.",

        "content": "The aftereffects of Hurricane Helene are still being felt in South Carolina as downed trees and vegetation fuel wildfires in the state, officials said in a news briefing on Friday.\n\nThere are currently three large fires burning in South Carolina: the Table Rock Fire, the Persimmon Ridge Fire and the Covington Drive Fire near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina Forestry Commission state forester Scott Phillips said during the briefing. A burn ban is in effect in the state.\n\nThe Table Rock Fire and the Persimmon Ridge Fire, referred to collectively as the Table Rock Complex, have burned a combined 10,672 acres and are 0% contained, Phillips said. The Covington Drive Fire is \"still very active\" but is 85% contained after burning just over 2,050 acres, Phillips said. Neither fire has burned any structures, and no fatalities have been reported, Phillips said.\n\nThe South Carolina National Guard has been deployed to fight the Table Rock fires, Brigadier General Rob Stillwell said in the news briefing, and is using aviation assets to respond to the blazes. The National Guard has dropped 612,000 gallons of water across 557 water drop missions, Stillwell said. Helicopter rescue teams are also ready to \"assist any distressed firefighters or citizens in the impacted area,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, 550 firefighters and 96 apparatus, including fire engines, brush trucks and special utility vehicles, have been deployed from local agencies, South Carolina State Fire Marshal Jonathan Jones said.\n\nA wildfire rages in the Carolinas. CBS News\n\nAn active start to wildfire season\n\nMarch has been an active month for fires in the state, Phillips said. There have been 373 wildfires reported in South Carolina this month. Neighboring North Carolina has recorded over 1,300 fires so far in March, according to the N.C. Forest Service.\n\n\"We are just at the beginning of our wildfire season here in South Carolina. We're 28 days in, we haven't even made it to April 1 yet,\" Phillips said. He added that April is when the state typically sees the most wildfires.\n\nWeather conditions do not seem to be letting up, Phillips said. The state is currently extremely dry, with low humidity and high winds, he said. Wildfire conditions will remain through April and \"potentially into May.\"\n\n\"This is going to be a long season for us as we move forward,\" Phillips said.\n\nSatellite view of the Table Rock Complex wildfire in Pickens County, South Carolina. Gallo Images\n\nHurricane Helene debris fuels flames\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said that the fires have been worsened by the aftereffects of Hurricane Helene, which devastated the region in September 2024. The hurricane and heavy rain knocked down a lot of trees and vegetation, he said. Clearing the fallen brush away has been difficult. The fallen vegetation has become fuel for the blaze, he said.\n\n\"We've never had a fire quite like this,\" McMaster said.\n\nThe effects of Hurricane Helene have also caused access issues in some areas, Phillips said. Some areas that are burning are inaccessible because of downed trees and debris, and some fire breaks that need to be readjusted can't be easily reached. Phillips said that even once this year's fire season settles down, the issues caused by Hurricane Helene will linger.\n\n\"Likely it's going to change the way we have to attack fires in the mountains of South Carolina and in the Hurricane Helene-impacted areas,\" he said.",

        "content": "The Sex Pistols, the legendary English punk band that helped the underground subculture of the genre to reach mainstream heights, is going on its first North American tour in more than 20 years.\n\nThe Pistols last went on a North American tour in 2003, when they were joined by original vocalist John Lyndon (formerly Rotten).\n\nThe 2025 iteration of the Pistols — original guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) — will hit the road on Sept. 16 at a very memorable stage: The Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.\n\nJones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"\n\nIt is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.\n\n\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.\n\nGlen Matlock, from left, Frank Carter, Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols, pose for portrait photographs, in London, Friday, March 21, 2025. Alberto Pezzali/Invision/AP\n\nThe 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.\n\nPre-sale opens April 2 and 3. Tickets go on sale April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.\n\nThey will perform the band's sole album, 1977's \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols Album\" live in its entirety as well as other material.\n\nSo, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?\n\n\"Why not?\" Jones said.\n\n\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"\n\nCarter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.\n\n\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \"Pistol.\" The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.\n\n\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.\n\n\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"\n\nAs for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.\n\n\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"\n\nDoes this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"\n\nThe band is currently on a world tour taking them to Japan later this month before stops in New Zealand, Australia and across Europe.",

Those strikes have brought the overall death toll in Gaza to well over 50,000 since the beginning of the war, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry.\n\nCBS News spoke recently with an Israeli soldier who has questioned the military's tactics. Tommy — not his real name, as he agreed to speak with CBS News on the condition of anonymity — fought in Gaza for the IDF, and his account of the tactics used raises some serious questions.\n\n\"We've burned down buildings for no reasons, which is violating the international law, of course,\" he told CBS News. \"…And we used human shields as protection.\"\n\nTommy said his commander ordered his unit to use Gazan civilians to search buildings for explosives instead of dogs.\n\n\"They were Palestinian,\" he said. \"We sent them in first to see if the building was clear and check for booby traps…They were trembling and shaking.\"\n\n\"We talked to our commander, and we asked him to stop doing it,\" Tommy said, but they were ordered to continue. He told CBS News it was policy.\n\nThe practice even has a name — the \"mosquito protocol\" — according to Breaking the Silence, an organization of Israeli veterans who say they're working to expose military abuses. The group told CBS News that several IDF whistleblowers had confirmed the protocol was widespread in Gaza.\n\nBreaking the Silence has acted as a watchdog body over the Israeli military for more than 20 years. It said it had corroborated Tommy's account with other soldiers.\n\nIn an email, the Israeli military told CBS News it prohibits the use of human shields but that it cannot investigate Tommy's claim without more detailed information.\n\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, and there is evidence of fighters embedding themselves and weapons in civilian areas, tunnelling underneath hospitals and firing rockets from such positions.\n\nThe IDF would not confirm if it was investigating any other reported instances of its forces using the \"mosquito protocol,\" but we discovered that Israeli forces are using the same Gaza playbook in the occupied West Bank, where a massive offensive has seen forces blow up homes and displace more than 40,000 people for over two months.\n\nIn the West Bank, CBS News met 14-year-old Omri Salem, a studious kid who dreams of being an engineer. His family has been in the area for generations. He told CBS News that, along with his nine-year old cousin, he was ordered by the IDF to search a four-story apartment building. He didn't want to do it.\n\n\"I was so scared,\" he said. \"Then they started beating us.\"\n\nOmri remains deeply emotionally scarred by the soldiers, whom he says forced him at gun point to be their human shield.\n\nIn Gaza, Tommy was the one holding the gun, but he said he was also traumatized.\n\n\"I'm morally wounded,\" said the soldier. \"It's f****d up, you know, to use citizens as your human shield like a dog.\"",

        "content": "Israeli troops ordered to seize more territory in Gaza by defense minister\n\nPalestinian officials said the war in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people after Israel ended the ceasefire last week in a wave of strikes that killed hundreds.\n\nIsrael, which threatened Gaza with \"complete destruction and devastation\" if Hamas didn't hand over the remaining hostages, has continued striking what it says are militant targets. It also launched ground incursions in northern Gaza.\n\nOvernight into Sunday, Israeli strikes across the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 26 Palestinians, including a Hamas political leader and several women and children.\n\nResidents said tanks had advanced into an area of the southern city of Rafah as the military ordered it evacuated.\n\nPalestinians flee to Khan Yunis as the Israeli army continues to attack in Rafah, Gaza on March 23, 2025. Ali Jadallah/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nPalestinian men, women and children could be seen walking along a dirt road and carrying their belongings in their arms, a recurring scene in a war that has forced most of Gaza's population to flee from the territory.\n\n\"It's displacement under fire,\" said Mustafa Gaber, a local journalist who left Tel al-Sultan with his family. In a video call, he said hundreds of people were fleeing as tank and drone fire echoed nearby. \"There are wounded people among us. The situation is very difficult,\" he said.\n\nA view of destruction following the Israeli attack on the house of Hamas Political Bureau Member Dr. Salah al-Berdawili and Abu al-Agha families in Khan Yunis, Gaza on March 23, 2025. Ali Jadallah/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces said the operation in Tel al-Sultan targeted \"terror infrastructure sites\" and sought to \"eliminate terrorists in the area, in order to reinforce control and expand the security zone in southern Gaza.\"\n\n\"The IDF will continue to operate against terrorist organizations in Gaza to protect Israeli civilians,\" it said in a statement.\n\nHamas said that Salah Bardawil, a member of its political bureau and the Palestinian parliament, was killed in a strike in Muwasi that also killed his wife.\n\nHospitals in southern Gaza said they received a further 24 bodies from strikes overnight, including several women and children.\n\nLater Sunday, Gaza's health ministry said an Israeli air strike hit a hospital in Khan Yunis, killing at least one person.\n\nThe ministry says the strike caused a large fire in the surgical building of the hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. The hospital says there are several wounded.\n\nIsrael's military confirmed the strike on the hospital, saying it hit a Hamas militant operating there. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.\n\nDr. Feroze Sidhwa, an American doctor inside the hospital, told CBS News on the phone that the front of the building was on fire following an explosion. He said the hospital was at a standstill and he was worried about the possibility of another attack.\n\nSources told CBS News that Ismail Barhoum, a political Hamas member and spokesperson, was the target of the strike at the hospital.\n\nThe Hamas-led Gaza's Health Ministry said a total of 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war and more than 113,000 have been wounded. The latest toll announced Sunday includes 673 people killed since Israel's surprise bombardment on Tuesday as well as 233 bodies that were recently identified, the ministry said.\n\nThe ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records but has said women and children make up more than half the dead. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 fighters, without providing evidence.\n\nLate Saturday, Israel's Cabinet approved a proposal to set up a new directorate tasked with advancing the \"voluntary departure\" of Palestinians in line with President Trump's proposal to depopulate Gaza and rebuild it for others.\n\nPalestinians say they do not want to leave their homeland, and rights groups have said the plan could amount to expulsion in violation of international law.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the new body would be \"subject to Israeli and international law\" and coordinate \"passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries.\"\n\nResidents of the Shuja'iyya neighborhood migrate to the center of Gaza City with what they could take with them due to Ithe sraeli army's intensive attacks on the area in Gaza on March 23, 2025.

Hamas-led militants took 251 people hostage.\n\nMost of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals, while Israeli forces rescued eight alive and recovered dozens of bodies.\n\nThe sides were supposed to begin negotiations in early February on the next phase of the truce, in which Hamas was to release the remaining 59 hostages — 35 of whom are believed to be dead — in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.\n\nThose talks never began, and Israel backed out of the ceasefire agreement after Hamas refused Israeli and U.S.-backed proposals to release more hostages ahead of any talks on a lasting truce.",

        "content": "Cairo — Palestinians chanted against Hamas during anti-war protests in the Gaza Strip, witnesses said Wednesday, in a rare show of public anger against the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group that has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory 17 months into the war with Israel.\n\nVideos that appeared to be authentic showed hundreds of people taking part in a protest in the heavily destroyed northern town of Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. People held signs saying, \"Stop the war,\" \"We refuse to die\" and \"The blood of our children is not cheap.\"\n\nThere were calls for more protests Wednesday. At least one was held in the hard-hit Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City, where dozens of men chanted, \"Out, out out! Hamas get out!\"\n\nA Palestinian youth carries a banner that reads in Arabic: \"Hamas does not represent us,\" during an anti-Hamas protest, calling for an end to the war with Israel, in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, March 26, 2025. AFP/Getty\n\n\"We are sick of the bombing, killing and displacement,\" said Ammar Hassan, who took part in the protest on Tuesday. He said it started as an anti-war protest with a few dozen people but swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.\n\n\"It's the only party we can affect,\" he said by phone. \"Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but it can affect Hamas.\"\n\nHamas security forces have violently cracked down on previous protests. This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed its war in Gaza.\n\nSenior Hamas official Bassem Naim, in a post on Facebook, wrote that people had the right to protest but that their focus should be on Israel, which he called the \"criminal aggressor.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, family elders from the city of Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's renewed offensive and its tightened blockade on all supplies into Gaza. Their statement said the community fully supports armed resistance against Israel.\n\n\"The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,\" said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father of three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined the demonstration. \"We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions.\"\n\nPalestinians take part in an anti-Hamas protest, calling for an end to the war with Israel, in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, March 26, 2025. AFP/Getty\n\nA similar protest occurred in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to witnesses. One protester there, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they had joined the demonstration because \"everyone failed us.\"\n\nThey said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the Western-backed Palestinian Authority and Arab mediators. They said there were no Hamas security forces at the protest, but scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the group.\n\nLater, they said they regretted participating because of Israeli media coverage, which emphasized the opposition to Hamas.\n\nA 19-year-old Palestinian, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said he planned to join demonstrations on Wednesday. His mother has cancer and his 10-year-old brother is hospitalized with cerebral palsy, he said, and the family has been displaced multiple times since their home was destroyed.\n\n\"People are angry at the whole world,\" including the United States, Israel and Hamas, he said. \"We want Hamas to resolve this situation, return the hostages and end this whole thing.\"\n\nThe protests erupted a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of whom Israeli believes to be alive. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThe war was triggered by Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 251 others abducted. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nIsrael's bombardment and ground operations have also caused vast destruction and, at their height, displaced some 90% of Gaza's population.\n\nHamas won a landslide victory in the last Palestinian elections, held in 2006. It seized power in Gaza from the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by the secular Fatah movement, the following year after months of factional unrest and a week of heavy street battles between the two groups.\n\nRights organizations say both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have violently suppressed dissent, quashed protests in the areas they control and jailed and tortured critics.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "The U.S. government is on an international egg hunt, seeking exports from countries in Europe and elsewhere to ease a severe shortage that has caused egg prices at grocery stores to hit record highs.\n\nGermany, Italy, Poland and Sweden are among the nations the U.S. Department of Agriculture approached to address the shortage brought on by a bird flu outbreak, according to European industry groups.\n\nBut supplying Americans with eggs would be complicated for foreign producers — but not because of political tensions over the myriad import tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened to impose on his nation's top trading partners.\n\nEven if they were eager to share, European countries don't have many surplus eggs because of their own avian flu outbreaks and the growing domestic demand ahead of Easter.\n\nTwo very different systems\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles, however, is the approach the United States takes to preventing salmonella contamination. U.S. food safety regulations require fresh eggs to be sanitized and refrigerated before they reach shoppers; in the European Union, safety standards call for Grade A eggs to be sold unwashed and without extended chilling.\n\n\"These are two systems that could not be more different,\" said Hans-Peter Goldnick, the president of the German Egg Association.\n\nIt is common in parts of Europe, for example, for consumers to buy eggs that still have feathers and chicken poop stuck to them.\n\nFarmer David Karlsch described the simple process that gets eggs from hens to customers of the family-owned Saballus poultry farm in Schoeneiche, a town just outside Germany's capital: The eggs are taken from nests, placed into cartons and sold on the premises or from a refrigerated vending machine just outside the property.\n\n\"The demand at Easter time is of course very, very high, as many children naturally want to paint eggs,\" Karlsch said.\n\nWashed vs unwashed eggs\n\nPoland, a major egg exporter, fielded a U.S. query about the availability of eggs, according to Katarzyna Gawrońska, director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers. The issue of washed vs. unwashed was a major factor as European officials considered such requests, she said.\n\nEggs are not cleaned in most of the 27 EU member nations because of concerns that removing the natural protective coating from eggshells makes them more vulnerable to bacteria, Gawrońska said.\n\nPolish veterinary officials are trying to determine if the country and its farmers can meet U.S. requirements, such as whether the exporting country has a comparable food safety inspection system or a significant bird flu outbreak.\n\nAlthough European Union regulations state that table eggs \"shall not be washed or cleaned,\" member countries have some leeway if they authorized egg baths at packing plants decades ago.\n\nNo extra eggs to export\n\nDanish Egg Association CEO Jørgen Nyberg Larsen said national customs are part of it; washed eggs are the norm in Sweden, for example. But Sweden and Norway have informed the U.S. they don't have extra eggs to export, Larsen said.\n\nFor now, any increased U.S. egg imports from Europe are more likely to arrive in powdered form or other products that can be shipped frozen or dried, Larsen said.\n\nThat's the response Poland's trade association gave U.S. officials. If the U.S. certifies Poland as a source, the organization's members would have a limited number of shell eggs to sell but could supply \"very large volumes of egg processing products,\" Gawrońska said.\n\nProcessed eggs usually are pasteurized to prevent foodborne illnesses and then used in food manufacturing or by restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nBaked goods, pasta and sauces like mayonnaise are some of the commercial products made with egg powder.\n\nNiente, nein\n\nU.S. officials also tried to sound out farmers in northern Italy's Veneto region for emergency egg supplies, according to Coldiretti, the main Italian agricultural lobbying organization.\n\nBut Italy only produces enough eggs to cover the national demand so most of the region's producers said they could not help. Bird flu outbreaks since the start of last year also have taken a toll on the Italian poultry industry.\n\nGermany cannot contribute much either. Its domestic poultry industry generates about 73% of the eggs consumed in the country, \"and we ourselves essentially have to import eggs from Holland every day to keep everyone satisfied,\" the German Egg Association's Goldnick said.\n\n\"We have around 45 million eggs that we can collect from the chicken coops every day, and in America, there's a shortage of around 50 million eggs a day. That shows how difficult it is,\" he said.\n\nOther countries the U.S. government contacted include Austria, Norway, Spain and Denmark. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it secured new egg commitments from Turkey and South Korea in recent months, although it did not specify the amount or type.\n\nImports of liquid, frozen and dried eggs may help free up some domestic shell eggs for consumers, but the U.S. made its appeal for foreign eggs amid a significant deficit; last month, the country produced 720 million fewer table eggs than in February 2024, a decline of nearly 10%.\n\nThe U.S. also cut its own egg exports to boost supplies at home, the Agriculture Department said.\n\nSigns of improvement\n\nWhile the informal trade talks continue, the U.S. market has shown signs of improvement. It's been nearly a month since a major bird flu outbreak impacted egg-laying hens, the department said. It reported the national wholesale price for large eggs dropped to $3.27 per dozen as of March 21, or less than half its peak of $8.15 per dozen on Feb. 21.\n\nU.S. consumers are just starting to see those falling wholesale prices translate to lower prices on grocery shelves, the department said. The big demand for eggs that usually accompanies Easter and Passover could cause prices to edge up again next month.\n\nHard-boiled feelings?\n\nPresident Trump hasn't exactly walked on eggshells with the people of Europe since starting his second term. The president's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a Danish territory, infuriated many in Denmark. His posture toward Ukraine and disparaging remarks from top members of his administration have alarmed America's European allies.\n\nThe European Union, which is the third-largest trade partner of the U.S., was not exempted from the tariffs Trump ordered on steel, aluminum and automobiles. Bracing for more, it has prepared counter-tariffs on American products.\n\nBut many officials in Europe say none of that would rule out exporting eggs.\n\nGoldnick said an egg producer friend recently told him that \"if the price is right, then I'll deliver.\" Any deals made or not would come down to business decisions, he said.\n\n\"I have two souls in my chest. On the one hand, I would say, 'No, we can't support this system,' but that's not the right answer,\" he said, referring to the new U.S. tariffs on European goods.\n\n\"The right answer is we have to help where we can. And it concerns the people. It doesn't concern the government. You wouldn't prop them up or anything, but it's just people's demand at Easter, for eggs, and that's just as important to satisfy in America as it is here.\"\n\n___\n\nGera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nLong-term CDs can boost returns over time, but are they the right fit this April? Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve met earlier in March and announced it would continue the rate pause it's had in place since the beginning of the year. The Fed's decision likely means that certificate of deposit (CD) rates will stay where they are for the time being, as CD rates tend to follow changes in the Fed's benchmark rate. For savers, that's good news, as CD rates remain high after peaking over the past couple of years. In fact, accounts with at least 4% are readily available from many banks.\n\nWhen you shop for CDs, you typically have two choices: long-term CDs with terms longer than one year and short-term CDs with terms of one year or less. Both options have fixed rates and guaranteed returns and are a low-risk way to invest your money. Long-term CDs are an interesting choice in the current economic environment because of their rates and the time commitment they require, which may lead you to wonder if they're a good option for you right now.\n\nWith that in mind, is opening a long-term CD worth it this April? Below, we'll break down what to consider.\n\nSee how much you could earn with a long-term CD here now.\n\nIs a long-term CD worth opening this April?\n\nSeveral factors make long-term CDs an interesting savings option this April:\n\nYou'll have more time to shop around\n\nThanks to the Fed's decision to keep interest rates paused and the fact that it won't meet again until May means that significant CD rate changes aren't likely to happen this April. Without the external pressure of any potential rate changes, savers have time to find a long-term CD with a competitive rate that meets their needs.\n\n\"The number one thing all savers should do to maximize CD returns is shop around,\" says Geri Hopkins, chief operations officer at Skyla Federal Credit Union. \"Consider online banks and credit unions, as they typically offer significant rate advantages over large brick-and-mortar banks.\"\n\nNot only do you have time to find the top long-term CD rates, but you also have time to build a CD strategy that includes long-term and short-term CDs, such as a CD ladder or CD barbell.\n\nBoth strategies play to a long-term CD's strength — leveraging compound interest for an extended time — while balancing out a long-term CD's lack of liquidity (many CDs charge an early withdrawal penalty if you withdraw your money before maturity) with short-term CDs that give you access to your money when they mature in one year or less.\n\nLock in your long-term CD returns now.\n\nYou can still earn a big return\n\nBecause CD rates will likely stay relatively high amid a Fed rate pause this April, you can lock in considerable returns through long-term CDs. Here's what you can earn from a $5,000 long-term CD at some of today's top rates, according to Bankrate:\n\n18-month CD at 4.16%: $315.22 at maturity, for a total of $5,315.22\n\n$315.22 at maturity, for a total of $5,315.22 2-year CD at 4.15%: $423.61 at maturity, for a total of $5,423.61\n\n$423.61 at maturity, for a total of $5,423.61 3-year CD at 4.15%: $648.69 at maturity, for a total of $5,648.69\n\nAnd here's what you could earn from a $10,000 long-term CD at some of today's top rates:\n\n18-month CD at 4.16%: $630.45 at maturity, for a total of $10,630.45\n\n$630.45 at maturity, for a total of $10,630.45 2-year CD at 4.15%: $847.22 at maturity, for a total of $10,847.22\n\n$847.22 at maturity, for a total of $10,847.22 3-year CD at 4.15%: $1,297.38 at maturity, for a total of $11,297.38\n\nYour money still needs protecting\n\nThe Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to its rates as there's a level of uncertainty over where the economy is headed this April and beyond. Additionally, inflation is still running higher than the Fed would like it to, even though February's rate dropped slightly. The combination of those two factors means it's still important for savers to protect their cash from future market instability while maintaining a rate of return that outpaces inflation.\n\nLong-term CDs can accomplish both those goals this April, locking in rates that beat inflation right now and returns that will remain unchanged no matter what happens to the economy during your CD's term.\n\nAdditionally, there's a sentiment among some economists that the Fed may lower rates later this year, although that's not a guarantee. If rates happen to fall later in 2025, after you opened your long-term CD, the rate you earn from the CD you open this April will remain the same.\n\n\"With new economic and geopolitical policies, and Fed rate cuts planned, I believe locking in a CD [rate] today in the mid to high 4s is a smart move for savers that won't need to use their savings for a year or two,\" Hopkins says.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nLong-term CDs provide excellent returns over time because they give your deposit time to grow through compound interest. However, the main thing to keep in mind when you open a long-term CD is that many accounts charge early withdrawal penalties if you pull your money out before maturity. If you're worried about liquidity, Hopkins recommends a CD ladder.\n\n\"Savers worried about locking up their money for extended periods of time should consider a CD ladder strategy as it provides cash liquidity on a regular monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or even annual schedule,\" she says. \"The longer the CD ladder, the more savers can take advantage of higher longer-term savings rate.\"",

        "content": "Washington — National security adviser Mike Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have so far survived the disclosure that they ran a high-level meeting on a military operation via a non-government app and inadvertently included a journalist.\n\nBut President Trump continues to privately vent his irritation about it and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout is quieting down, according to sources familiar with the matter. The issue is \"still a hot potato,\" one official told CBS News.\n\nSources said Mr. Trump has been more irritated that Waltz had the phone number for the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, than he was about the use of the Signal app by top national security officials to discuss coming plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. The magazine published its account on Monday.\n\nAfter Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, multiple sources said. But in the end, Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump has not asked him to step down, several sources said. Publicly, Mr. Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"\n\nThe Signal situation, which Waltz called \"a mistake,\" hasn't been the only snafu for the president's team this week. Mr. Trump on Wednesday evening was unaware that four U.S. military members had gone missing the day before in Lithuania until a reporter asked him about it during an on-camera event in the Oval Office.\n\nThe Army soldiers went missing early Tuesday during a military exercise. The Pentagon had publicly released information about the overseas incident at midday Wednesday, but staff hadn't yet told the president.\n\nAsked if he had been briefed, Mr. Trump told the reporter: \"No, I haven't,\" before moving on to the next press question. Mr. Trump typically chooses to not receive daily classified intelligence briefings, unlike past presidents. The search for the soldiers was continuing Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House still hadn't ruled out ousting someone over the Signal incident, sources said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, the president \"continues to have confidence in his national security team.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump is still unhappy with Waltz, as are some other top White House and Cabinet officials, according to multiple people familiar with their thinking.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, sent a letter Thursday asking the acting inspector general for the Defense Department to conduct an inquiry into the incident and brief senators.\n\nIt was Waltz who added Goldberg to the Signal chain, sources said. Deputy national security adviser Alex Wong, who has been taking fire from staunch Trump supporters and the conservative media over the incident, wasn't involved in setting up the chat, although he was a participant in the conversation, sources said.\n\nSenior officials don't think there was anything nefarious in adding the journalist to the chat — they believe it was inadvertent. A review of the incident by Elon Musk continued Thursday.\n\nOne reason for the public show of confidence in the national security team, several sources said, is that Trump and top officials refuse to hand The Atlantic — and Democrats — a perceived victory.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — Rep. Elise Stefanik's nomination to be U.N. ambassador has been withdrawn, President Trump confirmed Thursday, with the president saying he's asked her to remain in Congress.\n\nThe president's decision to pull her nomination ends two months of limbo for the New York Republican.\n\n\"As we advance our America First Agenda, it is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We must be unified to accomplish our Mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts from the very beginning. I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, CBS News reported her nomination was in jeopardy as GOP pressure mounted for her to back away from the position.\n\nMultiple sources told CBS News there were ongoing discussions about whether she should withdraw from consideration. Stefanik had not resigned from her seat in Congress, and with the narrow majority in the House, Republicans need all the votes they can muster. House Speaker Mike Johnson was aware of some of the conversations about Stefanik that took place Thursday.\n\nRepublicans hold just 218 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 213 seats. There are currently four vacant seats. After the president's announcement, Johnson acknowledged the Republicans' slim majority on social media as he hailed Stefanik's \"selfless decision.\"\n\n\"It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise's agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump's America First policies,\" Johnson said on social platform X, calling Stefanik \"a great leader and a devoted patriot.\"\n\nThe speaker said he would invite Stefanik to return to the House Republicans' leadership team immediately.\n\nDemocrats pounced on the withdrawal, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries noting Mr. Trump's margin of victory in Stefanik's district during November's presidential election.\n\n\"Donald Trump won the Elise Stefanik district by 21 points in November 2024. He withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"The Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared. What happened to their so-called mandate?\"\n\nIn the Senate, there was little doubt Stefanik would have the votes to be confirmed. Her nomination was advanced by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 30.\n\nRepublicans had discussed waiting to take further action on Stefanik's nomination to see how the Florida special elections go on April 1 for two vacant GOP seats. Both are expected to remain in Republican control.\n\nStefanik did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.\n\nStefanik has been among President Trump's most faithful allies and was the second nominee he announced for a Senate-confirmed position after the 2024 election. She was elected to Congress in 2014 and rose to House GOP leadership to be the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House.\n\nStefanik attended a Cabinet meeting at the White House late last month.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student and pro-Palestinian activist being held in an immigration detention center in Louisiana, are fighting to have the case heard in New Jersey.\n\nKhalil remains in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, as President Trump's administration seeks to deport him.\n\nThe Southern District of New York ruled last week the case should be heard in New Jersey, where Khalil was detained when his attorneys filed a petition on his behalf. The federal government then filed a motion to keep him in custody in Louisiana and have the case proceed from there.\n\nAt a hearing Friday at a courthouse in Newark about where the case will be held, the judge did not issue a ruling but said he would respond quickly. He also said he would not rule on the issue of bail until after the jurisdiction is determined.\n\n\"This is a case where the United States government has created a policy targeting Palestinian activists, and specifically Mahmoud Khalil, for arrest, detention and potential removal, because the United States government disagrees with his constitutionally protected right to dissent from U.S. foreign policy,\" Khalil's attorney, Baher Azmy, told reporters after the hearing.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse, saying they are less concerned about the location of the case and more that Khalil remains in custody.\n\n\"What's at stake right now in the U.S. is everybody's right to free speech. We need to be clear that this is a crackdown on everyone, not just the Palestine movement,\" one persons said.\n\n\"Mahmoud Khalil is not alone, we are here and we will not be silent. We demand his release, we demand an end to the targeting of activists,\" said another.\n\n\"Taken away from me in the middle of the night\"\n\nThe 30-year-old father-to-be was arrested earlier this month when ICE agents came to his university-owned apartment building in Manhattan.\n\n\"My husband was taken away from me in the middle of the night,\" his wife, Noor Abdalla, told CBS News Sunday Morning. \"It was one of the most terrifying times of my life. I don't think I've ever experienced anything scarier than that.\"\n\nKhalil is a Palestinian born in Syria and has a green card, or legal permanent residency. He is not charged with any crimes.\n\nAfter he was taken into custody, the government said it was invoking a rarely used section of U.S. immigration law to justify his detention and possible deportation. The law allows the secretary of state to subject noncitizens to deportation if their actions threaten foreign policy interest.\n\nICE arrests stretch from Columbia to other universities\n\nKhalil was a prominent figure during last year's pro-Palestinian encampment on Columbia's main lawn in Morningside Heights.\n\nHe was not among the hundreds of people arrested during the protests, but the White House alleges his actions were in support of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.\n\nIn a court filing earlier this week, the government also said he failed to disclose some of his work history on his immigration paperwork, including an internship with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, the Syria office of the British embassy in Beruit and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.\n\nIn the weeks since Khalil's arrest, other students and faculty at Cornell, Georgetown, Brown and Tufts universities have also been targeted by immigration officials because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday 300 student visas have been revoked.",

        "content": "Beirut, Lebanon — Israel has launched an attack on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for the first time since a fragile ceasefire ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in November. Associated Press reporters in Beirut heard a loud boom and witnessed smoke rising from the area that Israel's military had warned it would strike.\n\nThe strike came after Israel's army urgently warned people to evacuate parts of a Beirut suburb, vowing to retaliate against strikes which it said were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Israel's defense minister said Friday that if there was no peace in Israel's northern communities there would be no peace in Beirut either.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said the strike in Beirut had targeted a Hezbollah drone storage facility in the Dahiyeh neighborhood, which Israel has long described as a key Hezbollah stronghold. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields and the IDF noted its advanced warning for people to leave the area on Friday.\n\nA man reacts at the site of an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut, Lebanon, March 28, 2025. AFP/Getty\n\nHezbollah denied firing the rockets at northern Israel, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon.\n\nLebanon's government ordered all schools and universities in Beirut's southern suburb of Hadath to close for the day. Residents were seen fleeing the area in cars and on foot ahead of the strike.\n\nIt was the first strike on Beirut since a ceasefire took hold on Nov. 27, 2024, between Israel and Hezbollah, a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization that has long been powerful political force in Lebanon, although Israel has struck targets in southern Lebanon almost daily since then.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after its ally Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack, which ignited the war in Gaza. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis who live in communities near the country's shared border.\n\nA map shows Israel and the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank, and Israel's borders with neighboring nations Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (not labelled) to the southwest. Getty/iStockphoto\n\nIsraeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.\n\nLast week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people.\n\nThe United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the exchange of fire was deeply concerning. \"This is a critical period for Lebanon and the wider region,\" she said Friday.\n\nThe Israeli strikes on Beirut came as Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun made his first visit to Paris as his country's leader. He met Friday with President Emmanuel Macron who, following their meeting, called the Israeli strike \"unacceptable\" and a \"violation of the ceasefire\" that he argued would \"play into the hands of Hezbollah.\"\n\nSmoke billows over Beirut's southern suburbs following an Israeli airstrike, as seen from Baabda, Lebanon, March 28, 2025. Mohamed Azakir/REUTERS\n\nAoun called the Friday strike a continuation \"of Israel's violations\" of the November ceasefire agreement, which was sponsored by the U.S. and France.\n\nIsrael continues bombing Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens\n\nThe escalation comes 11 days after Israel abruptly ended its separate ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza, by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people in the decimated Palestinian territory.\n\nEarlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million inhabitants.\n\nIsrael has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds in Gaza — 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. Israel is demanding that Hamas give up power, disarm and send its leaders out of Gaza into exile.\n\nHamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThe war triggered by Hamas' terrorist attack has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry. The attack on Israel saw Hamas and its allies kill some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage.\n\nAlmost 40 more people were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight, Palestinian media outlets said Friday, including 14 who were reportedly killed in a strike that hit a house in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza city. The Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday that 855 people had been killed since the resumption of Israeli attacks on March 18. The Hamas-run ministry's figures do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.\n\nThe World Central Kitchen charity said in a social media post that one of its volunteers in Gaza was killed in an Israeli airstrike Thursday that hit near one of its kitchens during a meal distribution.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy today,\" the organization, founded by American-Spanish chef José Andrés, said in a social media post, adding that six other people were wounded in the same strike. About a year ago, Andrés accused Israeli forces of \"targeting us in a deconflicting zone\" in Gaza. The charity acknowledged dismissing some staff in Gaza in December after Israeli authorities provided a list of about 60 WCK volunteers whom it alleged were linked to terrorism.\n\n\"This should not be taken as a conclusion by WCK that the individuals are affiliated with any terror organization,\" the Washington D.C-based charity said at the time. \"Prior to receiving the results of the COGAT [Israeli government] security check, we had no reason for concern regarding any of these individuals and, because Israel does not share intelligence with aid organizations, we do not know the basis for Israel's decision to flag these individuals. However, we felt this step was necessary to protect our team and operations.\"\n\nThe United Nations' World Food Program also sounded alarm Friday over the deepening hunger crisis in Gaza more than two weeks after Israel cut off the flow of most humanitarian aid into the territory, with its director in the region telling the Al Jazeera network that more than 90% of the enclave's population lacked food security.\n\nAccording to a report by the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Israel obstructed 82% of aid convoys intended for Gaza between March 18 and March 24), hampering relief efforts.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Why consumers don't feel confident about the economy right now\n\nThe core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, ticked up last month, rising more than economists had forecast and signaling that price hikes remain stubbornly elevated.\n\nInflation yardsticks such as the PCE index and the Consumer Price Index measure the change in prices over time of a typical basket of goods and services.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe core PCE, which excludes volatile fuel and food prices, showed a 2.8% increase last month on an annual basis, versus a 2.6% annual increase in January, according to data released Friday by the Commerce Department.\n\nEconomists had forecast that the core PCE in February rose 2.7%, according to financial data firm FactSet. Including fuel and food prices, the PCE rose 2.5% on an annual basis, matching the prior month's increase.\n\nWhile inflation has cooled considerably from its peak above 9% in June 2022, the Federal Reserve wants to drive the annual rate of price increases to 2%, a goal that remains elusive. The Trump administration's tariff barrage — including a new 25% tariff on auto and car part imports — could reignite inflation later this year, economists say.\n\nWhat economists say\n\nThe pickup in core inflation likely means the Federal Reserve will hold off on further rate cuts, said Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management in an email. Earlier this year, the Fed paused its series of rate cuts given sticky inflation data that pointed to a stall-out in its battle against price hikes.\n\n\"Today's higher-than-expected inflation reading wasn't exceptionally hot, but it isn't going to speed up the Fed's timeline for cutting interest rates, especially given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs,\" Zentner said.\n\nThe PCE report also included data on consumer finances, showing that consumers saw their incomes jump 0.8% in February although they increased spending at just 0.4%, noted Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic in an email.\n\nU.S. consumers are putting that extra money aside in savings, pushing up the household savings rate to its highest level since June 2024, she noted. Americans' outlook for the economy has grown somewhat more pessimistic since last month, with relatively more expecting a slowdown or recession over the next year, recent CBS News polling has found.\n\n\"Heightened uncertainty around the economic outlook, fears of accelerating inflation and the declines in the equity market are depressing consumer confidence,\" Bostjancic said.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court orders blocking deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe Justice Department made the request for emergency relief just days after a federal appeals court in Washington declined to let the administration resume the deportations of people believed to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador under the wartime authority.\n\n\"This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country — the President, through Article II, or the Judiciary, through [temporary restraining orders],\" acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote. \"The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President. The republic cannot afford a different choice.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has asked lawyers for a group of five Venezuelan nationals who challenged the administration's efforts to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to respond to the Justice Department's request by April 1.\n\nThe dispute over President Trump's effort to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants believed to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua has played out amid a host of lawsuits challenging many aspects of his second-term agenda. The request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court is now the sixth made by the Justice Department. Three others are still awaiting action by the justices.\n\nAs with the others, the latest bid for intervention by the high court attacks the scope of the order issued by the district judge presiding over the case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. But the criticisms of Boasberg by the president and his allies escalated the administration's ongoing tension with the courts. Mr. Trump called for the judge to be impeached after he issued an order that blocked the administration earlier this month from using the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport migrants, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\n\"[T]he district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote in her filing with the Supreme Court. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"\n\nThe legal battle began earlier this month when the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the deportation of Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of Tren de Aragua prison gang. Mr. Trump claimed in his proclamation that the gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for using the authority, which has only been invoked three times before, and all during times of war.\n\nThe president declared that all members of the gang who are in the U.S. unlawfully were \"subject to immediate apprehension, detention and removal.\"\n\nFive Venezuelan nationals who are being held at an immigration detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on March 15 that sought to stop the administration from removing them under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nBoasberg agreed to block the removals of the five Venezuelans for 14 days. Several hours later, the judge expanded his order to prevent the Trump administration from deporting any migrants believed to be members of Tren de Aragua under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe judge had also told the Justice Department in person during a hearing that any planes carrying people subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation that were going to take off or were already in the air needed to return to the U.S. Planes carrying migrants later landed in El Salvador, raising questions about whether the government complied with Boasberg's order.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that it was not bound by the oral directive, though the district court has continued to examine whether the government complied with his order.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed the court's two-week ban on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which issued a 2-1 decision Wednesday that declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations.\n\nIn the filing with the Supreme Court, Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president sweeping national-security authority, and she warned that the district court's orders are harming the administration's ability to conduct foreign policy.\n\n\"That order is forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans,\" she argued. \"Those orders —which are likely to extend additional weeks — now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"\n\nIn addition to this case, the Supreme Court is also weighing requests for emergency relief arising from challenges to Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, the mass firings of federal probationary workers and the Department of Education's cancellation of teacher preparation grants that purportedly funded diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Utah has become the first state to ban fluoride from being added to public water systems.\n\nGov. Spencer J. Cox signed a bill on Thursday banning the mineral's addition to the public water supply, which is commonly done to reduce tooth decay. The ban will take effect on May 7, 2025.\n\nThe bill prohibits communities from adding fluoride to public water supplies, and bans the enactment and enforcement or ordinances that require fluoride be added to water systems. The bill does allow pharmacists to prescribe fluoride supplements to individuals, and instructs the state's Division of Professional Licensing to establish guidelines for such prescriptions.\n\nThe ban comes after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, even though the process is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\n\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that helps strengthen tooth enamel and reduce cavities, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Poor oral health has been linked to complications including cardiovascular disease, and experts have told CBS News that preventative care is the best way to keep dental health in check.\n\nPutting fluoride in public water supplies has been common in the United States since the 1950s, and researchers say drinking water is the main source of fluoride for Americans.\n\nAt high levels, fluoride has been linked to health concerns including possibly lower IQs, but the levels maintained in drinking water systems are much lower. There are recommended levels of fluoride in water, and researchers say that at those levels, people are not likely to experience any adverse effects.\n\n\"Seventy years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults,\" the American Dental Association says online.\n\nStudies have \"consistently shown that communities with fluoridated water have lower rates of cavities,\" Dr. Kevin Sands, a board-certified cosmetic dentist in Beverly Hills, California, previously told CBS News. \"Moreover, water fluoridation is a cost-effective public health measure that reduces the need for more extensive dental treatments, ultimately improving overall dental health for the population.\"\n\nNearly two-thirds of the nation drinks fluoridated water, but only about two in five Utah residents are served by community water systems receive it. The state ranks 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridited water.\n\nState Rep. Stephanie Gricius, a Republican who sponsored the bill alongside state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, told The Associated Press that the bill \"isn't anti-fluoride legislation.\"\n\n\"I don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\" Gricius said. She called the bill \"pro-informed consent and individual choice.\"\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — The Signal group chat that conveyed details of the timing and weapons descriptions of a planned attack against the Houthis in Yemen included the names or initials of 18 Trump officials and, of course, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who published his account of the messages.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council has confirmed that the message thread \"appears to be authentic,\" and none of the reported participants has denied their appearance in the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services committee have asked the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General to investigate the incident.\n\nSo who are the officials whose contacts appear in the Signal chat, and what do they do?\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz\n\nGoldberg said that on Tuesday, March 11, he received a connection request on Signal, from a user identified as Michael Waltz. That turned out to be national security adviser Michael Waltz, a top adviser to the president.\n\n\"Two days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group,\" Goldberg wrote. \"It was called the 'Houthi PC small group.'\"\n\nWaltz launched the group's conversation, saying, according to The Atlantic: \"Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours.\"\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz speaks with the media following meetings with a Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, March 11, 2025. Saul Loeb / AP\n\nAs national security adviser, Waltz is a presidential appointee and does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nPresident Trump told NBC he still has confidence in Waltz, saying, \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"\n\nWaltz said he took \"full responsibility\" and that he \"built\" the Signal chat group, but he also said he did not have Goldberg's contact information and he didn't know how Goldberg got into the chat. Goldberg said he received a Signal request from a user identified as \"Michael Waltz.\" And soon after, a screenshot Goldberg provided said, \"Michael Waltz added you to the group.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is the official who sent out the times and types of weapons that would be used in the attack ahead of time, according to screenshots of the conversation published by The Atlantic. Neither the White House nor Hegseth has disputed the authenticity of Hegseth's communication, but they have insisted it doesn't constitute \"war plans.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth prepares to give a television interview outside the White House on March 21, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein / AP\n\nAs the secretary of defense, Hegseth is the chief defense policy adviser to the president, as well as the second person in the chain of command to Mr. Trump.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Wednesday, March, 26, President Trump said Hegseth \"did nothing wrong\" and suggested that Hegseth himself could lead a review into whether any of the information should have been classified. \"Sure, I'll ask him to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are a lot of ways to answer that question. But I'd certainly ask him to take a look at it.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance\n\nVice President JD Vance also makes an appearance in the group chat, offering his concerns about the operation, such as risking a spike in oil prices. In the chat, Vance's account said he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" while saying \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"\n\nSince The Atlantic articles published, Vance said Goldberg \"oversold what he had.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance speaks at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico during a tour March 26, 2025, in Quantico, Va. Rod Lamkey / AP\n\nAs vice president, Vance is not only second in line to the presidency, but a key adviser on virtually all matters of domestic and foreign policy to the president.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe's name appears in the chat as well, and he confirmed it was him in testimony before the Senate this week. The Ratcliffe comments in the chat included saying that from a CIA perspective, \"we are mobilizing assets to support now but a delay would not negatively impact us and additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.\"\n\nJohn Ratcliffe appears for his Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 15, 2025. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nIn his congressional testimony, Ratcliffe said his \"communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"\n\n\"TG\" — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard\n\nA user called \"TG\" in the Signal chat appears to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, The Atlantic reported. In congressional testimony this week, Gabbard did not deny that she was in the message chain, but she said she was \"not directly involved\" in the part of the chat that discussed attack plans.\n\nAs the director of national intelligence, Gabbard is a Cabinet-level head of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks during a Senate Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 25, 2025, Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nGabbard testified Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, where she said Signal came pre-installed on government devices.\n\nSpecial envoy Steve Witkoff\n\nThe name Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East and Ukraine, also appears in the chat.\n\nWitkoff was in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin during part of the period leading up to the attack.\n\nSources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that Witkoff didn't have his personal device or government phone with him in Moscow, and that he was given access to a \"classified protected server\" by the U.S. government and was \"very careful\" about his communications while in Russia.\n\nIn his own social media post Wednesday, Witkoff said he had \"no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"\n\nWitkoff had little communication in the chat.\n\nScott B.\n\nScott B. appears to be Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to The Atlantic. The Scott B. account designated someone from the Treasury Department to be his point of contact for matters related to the strike. The Treasury Department oversees things like sanctions.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles\n\nThe name of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles is a contact in the Signal group, although the screenshots The Atlantic published don't include contributions from Wiles' name.\n\nAs the White House chief of staff, Wiles is responsible for managing the president's senior staff as well as overseeing the execution of his agenda.\n\n\"MAR\" — Secretary of State Marco Rubio\n\nThe name \"MAR\" appears twice in the contacts list. The Atlantic points out the secretary of state's full name is Marco Antonio Rubio, and \"MAR\" chimed in on behalf of the State Department.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rubio confirmed his presence in the chat, saying he only contributed twice.\n\n\"I can speak to myself for my presence on it — I think my role on it was just speaking for my role,\" Rubio said. \"I contributed to it twice. I identified my point of contact, which is my chief of staff. And then later on, I think three hours after the White House's official announcements have been made, I congratulated the members of the team.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio at a news conference in Jamaica on March 26, 2025. Nathan Howard / AP\n\nIn the chain, \"MAR\" designates Mike Needham, Rubio's counselor and chief of staff, to be the State Department's point of contact. Needham's account does not converse in the chat.\n\nDeputy national security adviser Alex Wong\n\nAlex Wong is Waltz' deputy. In his initial messages, Waltz said Wong was \"pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency chief of staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning.\"\n\nJoe Kent\n\nMr. Trump tapped former Green Beret Joe Kent to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, and Kent's name appears in the Signal chat. In the chat, Gabbard designated Kent to be the point of contact for her Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nOthers\n\nOthers included in the Signal chat are identified as Brian, who referred to himself in the chat as \"Brian McCormack for NSC,\" Walker Barrett, Jacob and \"SM,\" who Goldberg reported he believed to be Trump adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Mike Needham's account conversed in the Signal chat, but that account did not. The report has been updated.",

        "content": "Greenlanders concerned over President Trump's comments about wanting U.S. to control island\n\nNuuk, Greenland — Vice President JD Vance will join his family Friday on a trip to Greenland — a vast island northeast of Canada that President Trump wants to absorb into the United States. Roughly three times the size of Texas, Greenland is covered mostly by an ice sheet and has a population of only about 56,000.\n\nIt is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, which is one of America's European NATO allies. On Thursday, the Danish Defense Minister said his country would not allow the U.S. to decide Greenland's future, but the giant, frozen island near the top of the world has been dragged against Denmark's will, and the will of its people, into a geopolitical storm by Mr. Trump's repeated threats to take control.\n\nThe U.S. president says American must control Greenland for security reasons, and he has refused to rule out using force to make that a reality.\n\nBut a recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island — America's furthest north military base — clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.\n\n\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.\n\nGetty/iStockphoto\n\nAsked if he'd like to become an American, Rosing said, \"No, not really. I could visit America for vacation and look around, but no.\"\n\n\"I think it's stupid,\" Nivinnguaq Rasmussen, a shop assistant in the capital city of Nuuk, said bluntly of the Trump administration's plans for his homeland.\n\n\"He says he wants national security, but I don't believe him,\" she told CBS News.\n\nAsked what she thought Mr. Trump really wanted control of Greenland for, she suggested the American leader was obscuring his true motivations.\n\n\"Something else that he's hiding,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. military base that the vice president and second lady Usha Vance will visit this week is critical to America's defense. It sits roughly on what would be the shortest possible route for Russian ballistic missiles to reach the U.S., over the Arctic.\n\nAn aircraft carrying businessman Donald Trump Jr., President Trump's son, arrives in Nuuk, Greenland, Jan. 7, 2025. EMIL STACH/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty\n\nBut some Greenlanders told CBS News it is not Russia that worries them, it's the United States.\n\n\"It's very scary for me,\" said one woman in Nuuk, adding that Mr. Trump appears able to \"do whatever he wants - kind of. It's very scary.\"\n\nClimate change melting the ice in Greenland is expected to make the island's lucrative mineral reserves more accessible, and some residents told CBS News they believe that is what Mr. Trump is really after — and they don't trust him.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "President Trump repeated vows to secure U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal in his speech to a joint a session of Congress on March 4.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"\n\nGreenland's prime minister responded: \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"\n\nNow, Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance are visiting Greenland on Friday, March 28, along with national security adviser Mike Waltz, amid fallout from leaked messages about an attack on the Houthis in Yemen. Donald Trump Jr. visited in January before the president took office.\n\nOn the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said in his March 4 address, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.\n\nPanama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.\n\nBelow is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.\n\nWhere is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?\n\nGreenland is located to the northeast of Canada. The largest island in the world, it is about 836,000 square miles, around the size of Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to only around 60,000 people. It is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark and has its own elected government.\n\nIts location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes — especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at — you don't even need binoculars — you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"\n\nAn illustration by the European University at St. Petersburg shows the Northern Sea shipping route, which a Russian tanker traversed for the first time ever in the winter in February 2021, and the longer southern Suez Canal route. European University at St. Petersburg\n\nThe Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.\n\n\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.\n\nPernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.\n\n\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.\n\nGreenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.\n\nThose mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.\n\nApartment buildings and houses are pictured in Nuuk, Greenland, on March 24, 2025. JULIETTE PAVY/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGreenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.\n\nCurrently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.\n\nGreenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.\n\nCurrently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.\n\n\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.\n\nDemand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.\n\nInside the Vances' Greenland visit\n\nUsha Vance was originally supposed to visit Greenland solo as part of an expanded cultural trip, but on Tuesday, March 25, the vice president announced he would join her.\n\nThe Vances arrived along with national security adviser Mike Waltz on Friday, March 28, to spend the day at Pituffik Space Base, the United States' northernmost military installation. The base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is locked in by ice for much of the year, according to its website, but operates its airfield year-round.\n\nVice President JD Vance arrives at the U.S. military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on March 28, 2025. JIM WATSON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThey met with service members at the base and received a briefing on Arctic security issues.\n\nWhile announcing his visit, Vance didn't mention Mr. Trump's hopes to acquire Greenland but said that the \"really important\" nation has been threatened by other countries.\n\n\"A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there,\" Vance said in a video announcing his visit.\n\n\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he added. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"\n\nA recent poll showed that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.\n\n\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News.\n\nWhat is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?\n\nAbout 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"\n\n\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.\n\nPanama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.\n\n\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.\n\nThe Panama Canal is a vital global trade route for maritime commerce. Elmurod Usubaliev/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nBut in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nAhead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.\n\nMr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.\n\nIn his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"\n\n\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"\n\nChina has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"\n\nThe history of Greenland\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.\n\nDenmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.\n\nThe history of the Panama Canal\n\nThe Panama Canal was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.\n\nIt was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.\n\nIn the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

        "content": "The Trump administration has opened investigations into the admissions policies at Stanford University and three campuses within the University of California system, including UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC Irvine, the Department of Justice said Thursday.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed the department's Civil Rights Division to investigate whether the schools' policies comply with the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions, the department said in a statement.\n\nSince taking office in January, President Trump has attempted to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs that his administration says exclude White and Asian American students. The administration has warned schools and colleges they could lose federal money over \"race-based preferences\" in admissions, hiring, scholarships and all aspects of campus life.\n\nThe latest action comes after the U.S. Department of Education said it was investigating 52 universities for alleged racial discrimination earlier this month. Most of those schools were told those investigations were due to a partnership with a nonprofit organization that aimed to help students of color get doctoral degrees.\n\n\"President Trump and I are dedicated to ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity across the country,\" Bondi said in the statement. \"Every student in America deserves to be judged solely based on their hard work, intellect, and character, not the color of their skin.\"\n\nStanford said in a statement Thursday that after the Supreme Court ruling, it took immediate steps to ensure its admissions process complied with the law.\n\n\"We continue to be committed to fulfilling our obligations under the law,\" the statement said. The school said it had not been told specifically why it was being investigated. \"We do not have details about today's announcement, but we look forward to learning more about their concerns and responding to the department's questions.\"\n\nThe University of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it was investigating \"a major medical school in California\" for alleged racial discrimination in admissions. The statement did not name the school. It said the action was in response to information the Office for Civil Rights had received. It did not give specifics.\n\nThe Trump administration also launched an investigation Thursday into the California Department of Education. At issue is a law that says districts can't force teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nA HELOC could be the cost-effective way to borrow money this April. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nIf you're looking to borrow money right now, you may not know exactly where to start. And while that's a positive when there are multiple, low-interest rate options to choose from, that's not exactly the case in the current economic climate. Thanks to an extended bout with inflation that hurt the pockets of millions of Americans, the cost of everyday living remains high, even if it's cooled from 2022 highs. At the same time, interest rates remain elevated, where they will likely remain at least until May, when the Federal Reserve meets again.\n\nIn this atmosphere, homeowners may be contemplating simply using their home equity. And a home equity line of credit (HELOC) could be the smart way to do so, especially based off recent activity in the space. But is a HELOC worth opening this April, specifically? Below, we'll explain why it could be.\n\nStart by seeing how low of a HELOC rate you'd qualify for here.\n\nIs a HELOC worth opening this April?\n\nWhile each homeowner's financial circumstances differ, there's a compelling argument for opening a HELOC this April. Here's why:\n\nInterest rates have been falling\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs declined for much of 2024. They then continued to fall in 2025, hitting an 18-month low and multiple two-year lows in March alone. Just six months ago, HELOC interest rates were hovering near 10%. Now they're barely over 8%, after falling in consecutive weeks. This gives homeowners looking to borrow a five- or six-figure sum of money an affordable way to do so.\n\nAnd with a HELOC, interest paid for financing an eligible home repair or renovation could qualify for a tax deduction, making this an even more attractive way to borrow money. Plus, thanks to a variable rate that changes monthly for borrowers you won't need to worry about refinancing should rates fall again as the HELOC will adjust independently.\n\nGet started with a HELOC here now.\n\nInterest rates will likely continue to fall in April\n\nIf the current trends hold, and indications are that they will, HELOC interest rates will likely continue to fall in April. This is especially likely if the next inflation reading released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on April 10 shows further cooling there (it dropped to 2.8% in February, according to the March 12 release). A cooling inflation rate, after all, tends to give the Federal Reserve more reason to cut rates. And HELOC lenders could get ahead of any assumed formal Fed action by preemptively reducing rates again this April.\n\nIt's already one of your cheapest borrowing options\n\nWhether interest rates on HELOCs continue to fall in April or not, it's already one of your cheapest borrowing options. It's less expensive than home equity loans, which have rates as high as 8.50% for 10-year repayment periods now. But it's also currently less expensive than personal loans, which have rates averaging 12.37% now and credit cards, which remain near record highs in the low 20% range.\n\nNone of these alternative borrowing options are likely to even become competitive with the lowest HELOC rates in April, let alone drop below them. Understanding this reality, then, many homeowners would find borrowing with a HELOC in the new month to be their optimal option.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWith an interest rate that's been steadily declining, is set to continue to fall in the weeks ahead and, thus, remains one of your very cheapest borrowing options, a HELOC makes a lot of sense for homeowners looking for additional financing heading into April. Still, it's important to remember that your home is collateral in these borrowing exchanges, so you should only withdraw as much as you can easily afford to pay back or you'll risk losing your home back to the lender. If you can manage the payments, however, a HELOC could be the smart move, both this April and in the months and years ahead.\n\nLearn more about your current HELOC options here.",

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nFinding a low home equity borrowing interest rate shouldn't be difficult to do this April. Getty Images\n\nIf you find yourself in a financial position where you need to borrow money, it's understandable. Inflation has dropped substantially from the 9% range it was hovering near in 2022 — but it remains elevated and is a major point of concern for millions of Americans. And that's been compounded by higher interest rates. While there was optimism that the Federal Reserve would consistently cut interest rates after starting last fall, that's been tempered in 2025 amid a pause in that campaign and muted results in the fight against inflation.\n\nUnderstanding these dynamics, it may be helpful to borrow money to help make ends meet and even to consolidate high-interest debt. To do so effectively, however, many will want to turn to their home equity via a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). But choosing the right option is just one part of the equation. The second and equally important part comes when trying to get a low home equity borrowing interest rate. Fortunately, there are multiple ways to do so, starting this April. Below, we'll break down three of the more effective strategies.\n\nStart by seeing how low of a HELOC interest rate you'd currently be eligible for here.\n\nHow to get a low home equity borrowing rate this April\n\nIf you've already determined that you need financial help in today's economy and want to secure it via your home equity, then you're already on the right track. Here's how to better ensure success by obtaining a low home equity borrowing rate this April:\n\nChoose a HELOC instead of a home equity loan\n\nWhile both HELOC and home equity loan interest rates have declined from where they were in 2024, HELOCs have seen a much steeper drop. Home equity loan rates are around 8.37% now, a little over half a percentage point from their January 2024 level. HELOC rates, however, have declined significantly and are now just 8.01%, making them about two points lower than they were in September 2024.\n\nConsidering that they've already hit 18-month and multiple two-year lows in 2025 (and it's only March), it makes sense to look to HELOCs versus home equity loans for your borrowing needs this April. And with a variable rate subject to decline further, minus the need to refinance (and pay for refinancing closing costs) as you would with a home equity loan, this becomes a particularly timely option right now.\n\nGet started with a HELOC online today.\n\nShop for lenders\n\nIt's always wise to shop around for home equity lenders to find the lowest rates and best terms, but it's especially a wise way to get a low rate this April. With an average HELOC interest rate that's declining on an almost weekly basis, you'll want to do your research to confirm that the offers listed online match the lower rate climate reality. Just be sure to complete an accurate comparison by getting offers for the same HELOC amounts and repayment periods to determine which offer really is the lowest versus which one just appears to be.\n\nExplore introductory rate options\n\nWhile shopping around for lenders, be sure to ask if they have HELOC introductory rates. These options, which can last for brief periods like six or 12 months, offer homeowners an opportunity to borrow at a below-average rate. These introductory rates could also be fixed for that full-time frame, while regular HELOC rates are typically not.\n\nThis will allow you to save money and budget more accurately over that period. Still, it's important to clarify what happens after that introductory rate concludes to avoid being burdened with a much higher interest rate once the introductory period concludes.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nGetting a low home equity borrowing rate is critical since your home functions as collateral. Secure too high a rate now, and your ability to make payments could jeopardize your homeownership. So it's important to strongly consider a HELOC over a home equity loan now, while also doing your due diligence by shopping for lenders and exploring introductory rate options. By taking these steps this April, you can potentially reduce your home equity borrowing costs and allow yourself to focus more on the reasons why you needed the funding to begin with.",

        "content": "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order targeting funding for programs at the Smithsonian Institution that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.\n\nThe president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"\n\nFile: Smithsonian Institution building in Washington, D.C. Noclip via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"\n\nThe order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.\n\nIt marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.\n\nThe executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.\n\nThe president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"\n\nThe order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nMr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.\n\n\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.\n\nLinda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"\n\nUnder the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.\n\nThe institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

        "content": "March 2025 already had a total lunar eclipse, and coming up next is a partial solar eclipse on Saturday, March 29.\n\nDuring the partial eclipse, the moon will pass in front of the sun and cast a shadow on parts of the Northern Hemisphere, according to NASA. Only part of the sun will be blocked, giving it a crescent appearance. While this won't be a total eclipse — like the one in 2024 — viewers will still need to use eye protection to safely view the phenomenon.\n\nAstronomy fans can experience the partial solar eclipse in parts of North America, along with sections of Europe, Africa, northern Asia, small parts of South America and throughout Greenland and Iceland.\n\nPartial solar eclipse map for March 2025\n\nA map shows where the March 29, 2025, eclipse can be seen. NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio\n\nA NASA map shows where viewers will be able to experience the partial solar eclipse. It will only be viewable for those in the moon's shadow.\n\nThe curved yellow lines on the NASA map show how much of the sun will be covered by the moon when the partial eclipse is at its maximum coverage. The green lines show when the maximum eclipse will happen at locations along the lines.\n\nWhen to see the partial solar eclipse\n\nThe viewers in the U.S. who are in the eclipse's path will need to wake up early to catch a glimpse of the solar eclipse because it will already be in progress during sunrise. The partial eclipse will occur later in the day elsewhere: in mid- to late morning in Europe and northwestern Africa, and in the afternoon or early evening in eastern Europe and northern Asia.\n\nNASA provided specific times for when the partial eclipse starts, reaches its maximum and ends in several cities around the world, including multiple in the Northeastern U.S. Because the partial eclipse will start before sunrise in the U.S., NASA instead provided times for sunrise for the best viewing experiences.\n\nThe earliest viewing in the U.S. will be in Portland, Maine, where the sun will rise at 6:27 a.m. EST and the partial eclipse will reach its maximum — 64% — by 6:30 a.m. The partial eclipse will end by 7:10 a.m.\n\nNext up is Boston, where the sun will rise at 6:31 a.m. EST, and the partial eclipse will reach the maximum coverage — 43% — by 6:38 a.m. The eclipse there will end by 7:07 a.m.\n\nNASA provided viewing times for two New York cities: Buffalo and New York City. In New York City, sunrise will be at 6:44 a.m. EST, with the eclipse reaching its maximum of 22% by 6:46 a.m. The partial eclipse will end by 7:04 a.m.\n\nThe coverage in Buffalo will be very small: the maximum will be just 2%. Sunrise there is at 7:02 a.m. EST, with the partial eclipse reaching its maximum by 7:05 a.m. and finishing by 7:09 a.m.\n\nThe nation's capital and Baltimore, Maryland, will similarly have very little coverage during the eclipse. Maximum coverage in Washington, D.C., will be just 1%, and in Baltimore it will be 3%. Sunrise in Washington is at 6:56 a.m. EST, with the partial eclipse reaching its maximum by 6:59 a.m. and ending by 7:01 a.m. In Baltimore, sunrise will be at 6:55 a.m., with the partial eclipse reaching its maximum at 6:57 a.m. and ending at 7:02 a.m.\n\nViewers in Philadelphia, where the sun will rise at 6:31 a.m. EST, are a bit luckier. The partial eclipse sun will rise at 6:49 a.m. and the partial eclipse will reach maximum coverage — 12% — at 6:51 a.m. The partial eclipse will end there at 7:03 a.m.\n\nThere will be another partial solar eclipse in September this year, but it will not be viewable from the U.S.\n\nHow to safely watch the partial solar eclipse\n\nIt is never safe to look directly at the eclipse without proper eye protection. Try safe solar viewing glasses, also known as eclipse glasses. Do not use regular sunglasses.\n\nLooking at the partial eclipse through a camera lens, telescope, binoculars or any other optical device even while wearing eclipse glasses or using a handheld solar viewer can also be dangerous, NASA said. There are solar filters that can be attached to the devices.\n\nUsing a pinhole projector is also a safe way of viewing the partial solar eclipse.",

So I banged on the closet, they let me out and, thankfully, they let me be with her the entire time, in her room,\" she said.\n\nShe said the burglars were inside the home for about 45 minutes, and they used her expensive luggage to carry out the valuables. She watched out the window from her daughter's room, waiting for them to leave.\n\n\"I ran downstairs and I was able to cut my nanny's ties, and then she cut my ties, and we locked the door,\" she said. \"They actually came back, again, but we closed the door in time.\"\n\nPolice said a sixth person waited inside a 2021 white Toyota RAV4 that was seen driving away from the house. One neighbor said she saw a group of masked men waiting on benches inside a nearby park right before the burglary.\n\nInvestigators are still trying to figure out if the family was targeted.",

        "content": "Washington — Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance are visiting a U.S. base in Greenland Friday, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah joined them on the trip.\n\n\"As you've heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration,\" the vice president told a group of service members at the dining hall at Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation.\n\nWhile Vance was on the base, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"\n\nThe second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president announced Tuesday that would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense. They'll be spending their time at the base.\n\nVance thanked the group and noted that service members stationed at the base can't bring their families along.\n\n\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"\n\nWaltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.\n\nVice President JD Vance arrives at the U.S. military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on March 28, 2025. JIM WATSON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.\n\n\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"\n\nThe statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"\n\nMr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people — a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada — live along Greenland's southern coast.\n\nA recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island — America's furthest north military base — clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.\n\n\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.\n\nAnd Greenland's prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.\n\nDespite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"\n\nMr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"\n\n\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Friday, Nov. 12, 2021, started as a fun night in Los Angeles for architect Hilda Marcela Cabrales, 26, and her friend, 24-year-old model Christy Giles. The pair headed out to a nightclub in Hollywood and then to a warehouse party in East Los Angeles to see a DJ they both loved.\n\nChristy's husband, Jan Cilliers, was in San Francisco that weekend visiting his father. He says Christy and Hilda, who was new to Los Angeles, were becoming \"fast friends.\"\n\nChristy Giles, left, and Hilda Marcela Cabrales photographed in the VIP section at the warehouse party where they went to see a favorite DJ. Jan Cilliers\n\nBut what started as a happy girls' night out took a sinister turn, Cilliers says, when he woke up that Saturday morning in San Francisco to see his wife's phone location at a Los Angeles address he didn't recognize. He and Christy always shared locations, he says, for safety reasons.\n\nCilliers says he texted Christy and didn't hear back. And, as the hours mounted without a word, Cilliers says, his fear began to grow.\n\nWhat happened that weekend and the tragic aftermath is investigated by \"48 Hours\" and contributor Jonathan Vigliotti in \"Dead Girls Don't Talk,\" to be broadcast Saturday, March 29 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.\n\nCilliers says he experienced \"raw panic\" when, at around 5 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 13, he says he saw Christy's phone had moved to a hospital about three miles from that strange address. Cilliers soon learned that Christy had been dropped there by two masked men in a black Prius without license plates. They said they found her unconscious on the street nearby and were being \"good Samaritans.\" Doctors had declared Christy dead on arrival.\n\nA screenshot of Christy Giles' location at the Southern California Hospital at Culver City. Jan Cilliers\n\n\"So, in less than 24 hours, your world was turned upside down?\" asks Vigliotti.\n\n\"Shattered, yes,\" Cilliers replies.\n\nHilda also had a habit of sharing her phone location — with a close friend who was also her emergency contact. That friend also became concerned on Saturday, when she saw Hilda's phone pinging at 8641 West Olympic Boulevard — the same address where Cilliers had tracked Christy's phone.\n\nHilda's friend soon learned that Hilda, like Christy, had been dropped off at a hospital by two masked men driving a black Prius with no plates, who said they had found Hilda passed out on the street.\n\nHilda was still alive, but in critical condition. Two weeks later, with no sign of regaining consciousness, her family made the difficult decision to take Hilda off life support. Her sister, Fernanda Cabrales-Arzola, said she remembers telling Hilda it was OK to leave and that she told Hilda, \"Thank you for being my sister.\"\n\nHilda's family decided to donate her organs, and her mother, Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia, said she remembers the medical team lining the hallway and \"clapping. To honor her for giving life.\"\n\nBecause both Cilliers and Hilda's friend knew exactly where the two women had been all day, and because they knew the minute each woman was taken to each hospital, when LAPD detectives got the call about the two cases, they had a huge head start.\n\nWithin hours of Hilda being dropped off at that second hospital, LAPD homicide detective Jonathan Vander Lee and his partner were on their way to 8641 West Olympic Boulevard. By the time they arrived, they knew it was the home of David Pearce and that he owned a black Prius. Pearce lived there with a roommate named Brandt Osborn.\n\nA month later, Pearce and Osborn were arrested in connection with the two women's deaths. Pearce was eventually charged with two counts of felony murder and Osborn, who was seen helping Pearce take both women out of their home and dropping them off at both hospitals, was charged with accessory to murder after the fact.\n\nIt took a little more than three years for their cases to go to trial, but in the end, Pearce was convicted of murdering Christy and Hilda and of raping seven other women who came forward to testify at the trial. The jury deadlocked on a verdict for Osborn, and a mistrial was declared for his case.\n\nAt a press conference after Pearce's conviction, Christy's mother, Dusty Giles, pleaded with the public to learn the safety lesson from her daughter's case, saying, \"As much as it hurts to lose my baby girl ... her sharing her location technology told us where she was.\"\n\nPolice say that information was critical to helping get Pearce, whom prosecutors say was a serial rapist, finally off the street.\n\nDusty Giles begged the public to learn the lesson from their horrendous loss, \"Please, within your own families ... share locations,\" she said, adding, \"You'll never know when you're going to not be able to get in touch with somebody.\"\n\nPearce has not yet been sentenced, and the district attorney has not announced if Osborn will be retried.",

        "content": "How cherry blossoms arrived to the U.S.\n\nHow cherry blossoms arrived to the U.S.\n\nHow cherry blossoms arrived to the U.S.\n\nWashington, D.C.'s iconic cherry blossoms reached the 2025 peak bloom on Friday, March 28, the National Park Service said, about a week after the city kicked off its annual Cherry Blossom Festival.\n\nThousands of trees with white and pink flowers circle the Tidal Basin and parks near some of the capital's famous monuments and memorials.\n\nHere's what to know about where to see the cherry trees in bloom.\n\nTidal Basin cherry blossoms in peak bloom in Washington, D.C.\n\nPeak bloom occurs when 70% of the blossoms of the Yoshino cherry trees, the most common type along the Tidal Basin, are open. The National Park Service, which tracks the blooming of the trees each year, announced peak bloom on March 28.\n\nThis year's peak came slightly earlier than the average date, April 3, but more than 10 days later than 2024's peak on March 17.\n\nThe timing of peak bloom varies each year, largely due to temperatures, with warmer temperatures leading to earlier peak blooms.\n\nSince 1921, when the National Park Service began recording the dates, peak blooms have shifted earlier by about eight days, the Environmental Protection Agency says.\n\nWhere to see the D.C. cherry blossoms\n\nThe most famous place to see the cherry blossoms in the nation's capital is around the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park. Many cherry trees are also along a section of the Potomac River and Washington Channel in East Potomac Park.\n\nThis year, construction that began in August 2024 to replace seawalls along the Potomac River and part of the Tidal Basin could affect the viewing of some of the cherry trees. The work is expected to last through 2026.\n\nHowever, there are many other cherry trees throughout Washington, D.C. Casey Trees, a nonprofit that plants and cares for trees in the city, provides a map of where to see the blossoms across Washington. The map does not include trees on private property, the organization said.\n\nHow long will the cherry blossoms last in D.C.?\n\nThe Yoshino cherry trees usually bloom for several days, the National Park Service said, but weather conditions will affect the length of time.\n\n\"Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms,\" the agency said on its website. \"A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.\"\n\nWhy does D.C. have cherry blossoms?\n\nJapan gifted more than 3,000 cherry trees to the United States in 1912 as a symbol of friendship.\n\nThat year, first lady Helen Herron Taft and the wife of the Japanese ambassador, Viscountess Chinda Iwa, planted two of the Yoshino cherry trees along the Tidal Basin, the National Park Service notes in a history of the trees. In the next few years, the trees continued to be planted around the basin and other areas.\n\nBut the idea to plant Japanese cherry trees in the U.S. capital was raised as early as 1885 by a woman named Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, a writer and diplomat, according to the National Park Service.\n\nDespite her first request to the U.S. Army Superintendent of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds not going anywhere, she continued to ask and eventually wrote to Herron Taft, who helped bring the idea to life, the agency says.",

Milton's conviction came after a short seller called Hindenburg Research alleged in 2020 that the EV maker had misrepresented its technology.\n\nIn his video, Milton said, \"The greatest comeback story in America is about to happen.\"\n\nNikola filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February, a move that came months after it warned it could likely run out of cash in early 2025. Once valued at around $30 billion, exceeding the market capitalization of Ford Motor Co., the EV maker was a rising Wall Street star before it became embroiled in scandal.\n\nLast month, Nikola said it plans to to continue limited service and support operations for vehicles on the road, including fueling operations through the end of March, subject to court approval. The company said that it would need to raise more funding to support those types of activities after that time.\n\nIn the video, Milton didn't disclose whether he had plans for Nikola or his involvement in the EV industry.\n\n\"I get to be with my wife now, I get to be with my family,\" Milton said. \"It is done, it is over.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Billionaire Elon Musk said he plans to hold a rally in Wisconsin to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the state's hotly contested Supreme Court race, despite a state law that prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for voting.\n\nMusk posted late Thursday night on his social media platform, X, that he plans to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election that will determine ideological control of the court.\n\nAttendance at Musk's talk will be limited only to those who have voted in the Supreme Court election, he said, without explaining how he would verify that.\n\n\"I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,\" Musk posted. \"This is super important.\"\n\nHe didn't say how the two people were chosen.\n\nThe Supreme Court race has shattered previous spending records for a U.S. judicial election and has become a referendum on Musk and the first months of President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nTrump, a Republican, endorsed Brad Schimel and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night.\n\n\"It's a very important race,\" Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel's campaign. \"I know you feel it's local, but it's not. It's really much more than local. The whole country is watching.\"\n\nSchimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday's election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.\n\nMusk earlier this week said he had awarded a voter in Green Bay $1 million for signing a petition his political action committee created targeting activist judges. Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether that person was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.\n\nMusk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.\n\nThat raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.\n\nAny legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nSchimel's campaign spokesperson did not immediately return a message early Friday about whether Schimel would attend the event with Musk.\n\nSchimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.\n\n\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.\n\nWhen asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, didn't respond to messages Thursday or early Friday about Musk's giveaways. Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, though, called Musk's visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"\n\n\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.\n\nMusk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.\n\nDuring last year's presidential race, Philadelphia's district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.\n\nMusk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.\n\nMusk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state.\n\nCrawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices.\n\nThe race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.\n\nWisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.\n\nMore than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.",

At least 10 people died in Thailand's capital Bangkok, where a high-rise building that was under construction collapsed, leaving dozens more missing under the rubble.\n\nA state of emergency was declared in Bangkok and in six regions and states in neighboring Myanmar, including its capital Naypyitaw. The head of Myanmar's ruling junta said in the televised speech Friday evening that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others injured in the disaster, and he appealed for international help.\n\n\"The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,\" Senior Gen.

SAI AUNG MAIN/AFP/Getty\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey and Germany's GFZ center for geosciences said the first quake had a magnitude of 7.7 and was at the relatively shallow depth of about 6 miles. Its epicenter was in Myanmar, according to preliminary reports, near the city of Mandalay. An aftershock with a magnitude of 6.4 shook the region 12 minutes later.\n\nDestruction in Myanmar\n\nMyanmar is in the midst of a civil war and many areas are not easily accessible. Photos from Naypyidaw showed multiple buildings used to house civil servants destroyed by the quake, and rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble.\n\nThe government said blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. Images of buckled and cracked roads in Mandalay and damaged highways as well as the collapse of a bridge and dam raised further concerns about how rescuers would even reach some areas in a country already enduring a widespread humanitarian crisis.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what relief efforts the ruling military regime would be able to provide, but it issued appeals for any help available, including blood supplies, from the international community. The major hospital in the country's capital that sustained significant damage was described as a mass casualty area, as medics raced to treat the wounded in an outdoor triage area.\n\nThe severely damaged emergency department of a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar is seen on March 28, 2025, after a massive earthquake hit central Myanmar.

I'm so exhausted.\"\n\nAFP journalists at the scene said people were crying in pain and others lay still as relatives tried to offer comfort.\n\n\"Hundreds of injured people are arriving... but the emergency building here also collapsed,\" security officials at the hospital told AFP.\n\nMedical workers transport an earthquake casualty on the grounds of a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, March 28, 2025, after a powerful quake struck the region.

The quakes set tall buildings swaying and prompted thousands of people to pour into streets across the city. Trading was halted on the stock exchange and public transport networks shut down in the Thai capital.\n\nThe collapsed building was being constructed by the China Railway Construction Corporation for Thailand's government auditor general.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed the moment the 33-story high-rise came tumbling down, sending a massive cloud of dust into the air as workers ran away from the site.\n\nRescue worker Songwut Wangpon told reporters that seven people were found alive, as he spoke next to the tall pile of rubble that was once the unfinished building near Bangkok's popular Chatuchak Market.\n\nAn injured man is rescued from a construction site where a building collapsed in Bangkok, Thailand, March 28, 2025, after a powerful earthquake hit the region.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nNot every homeowner will qualify for a $100,000 home equity loan. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nOn the surface, borrowing from your accumulated home equity may seem like an unwise and potentially risky decision. After all, it took years, if not decades to build up that equity and borrowing from it will reduce your home's value. And, if you fail to make your repayments, you could even potentially lose your home to the lender. But while those concerns are fair and legitimate, in today's unique economic climate, borrowing with a home equity loan, specifically, can still be a cost-effective and valuable move.\n\nWith inflation still making the costs of everyday living prohibitive and higher interest rates on pause for an extended period now, homeowners may be looking for ways to make ends meet. But whether you need the money to complete a major home renovation or repair or for something else entirely, borrowing a large, $100,000 home equity loan should be carefully considered. In reality, there are likely few homeowners who could realistically qualify for a home equity loan of this size right now. Below, we'll detail three of them.\n\nSee how much home equity you could potentially borrow here.\n\n3 homeowners who could qualify for a $100,000 home equity loan\n\nIf you're a homeowner who falls into one or more of the following three categories, then a $100,000 home equity loan could be available for you now:\n\nHomeowners who made a substantial down payment on their home\n\nThere's a misconception that home equity is only painstakingly built up over time.\n\nBut even if you only recently purchased your home and made a substantial down payment when doing so (think over 20%), you may have enough equity to borrow $100,000 via a home equity loan. That's because home equity is calculated by deducting your mortgage balance from your home's current value.\n\nLet's say you bought your home for $500,000 and made a down payment of $250,000; your home's value has since increased to $600,000, but your mortgage balance is now $200,000. In this case, you'd have equity of $400,000 ($600,000 - $400,000). While most lenders would require you to keep a 20% buffer, that would still leave you with $320,000 worth of equity to borrow from now. So a $100,000 home equity loan could be relatively easy to obtain, and it would leave a significant six-figure sum of equity in the home for the future, even if you bought the home in the last few years or so.\n\nLearn more about borrowing with a home equity loan now.\n\nVeteran homeowners\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, maybe you're a homeowner who didn't make a big down payment. Maybe you even had to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) until you reached the traditional 20% equity threshold. But if you've built up your home equity since, you could qualify.\n\nAnd this doesn't necessarily mean you have had to pay down all or even most of your mortgage. Home prices and values are determined by a myriad of factors, including location. So while your progress toward paying down your mortgage may not be extensive, your home's value could have surged in recent years, as it did in many parts of the country. In these instances, veteran homeowners should have little difficulty securing a $100,000 home equity loan now.\n\nHomeowners with good credit scores\n\nFundamentally, homeowners will need to first have built up their home equity to have enough to borrow a six-figure amount. But that doesn't mean that you can automatically withdraw from it if you have. Strict eligibility requirements will still apply as they would for most other borrowing products and that means having a good credit score with a history of on-time payments. Without it, even with enough equity in the home, you may not qualify to get the loan.\n\nOn the other hand, some lenders will approve the loan but at a prohibitive interest rate. Borrowing that way, however, would be particularly risky, especially for a loan amount like $100,000. Payments here will be high even for qualified borrowers but for those with mediocre credit, they'll be even more expensive. And that's a risk worth avoiding considering that lenders can repossess your home if you fail to make your payments as agreed upon.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSecuring a $100,000 home equity loan can be difficult but not impossible. If you made a large down payment at closing, have since built up significant equity in the property and have a good credit score, most lenders will approve you for a $100,000 home equity loan. Just be sure to closely compare this borrowing option against others to ensure it's the right fit for your financial needs. And crunch the repayment costs with precision to determine long-term affordability.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThey’d never even visited Ecuador before, but Brittany and Blake Bowen, from the United States, decided to move to the South American country in 2021 to give their four children a completely different upbringing.\n\nThe Bowens, who were previously based in the state of Washington, have been living in Loja, a small city based in the southern section of the Andes Mountains, ever since, and say that they are in it for the long haul.\n\n“We love this little country,” Brittany tells CNN Travel. “We hope that maybe we’ll have grandkids here one day.”\n\nBig decision\n\nThe Bowen's adapted to life in Ecuador quickly and are thriving in the South American country. Brittany Bowen\n\nBefore the move, the couple, who’ve been married for nearly 17 years, say that they were becoming increasingly concerned about the pressures placed on children by “modern American society” and wanted to try something new.\n\n“We did not like what we’d seen develop over the course of the last couple decades…” adds Brittany, explaining that they felt that young people in the United States were becoming “more isolated.”\n\n“We weren’t confident that our kids would enjoy the same sort of potential trajectory that previous generations had shared.\n\n“And the more we considered things like that, the more we wondered, ‘Is that even what we want? Do we even want them to be on a fast track to the American Dream?”\n\nThe couple were also frustrated with living what they describe as the “standard American life.”\n\n“Long commutes and never enough money,” says Blake. “All those usual problems… I was working in a career that was very time consuming, and took me away from home a lot. So we didn’t want that anymore.”\n\nSo why did they choose Ecuador as their “new home”?\n\n“We’d always had South America on the mind,” explains Brittany, who is fluent in Spanish and previously studied in Argentina.\n\n“And talked about it off and on since we met. Always wondering when and if the door was going to open.”\n\nThe couple, who previously worked in disaster management, go on to explain that they’d been discussing the prospect of relocating for around 15 years, but it wasn’t until the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020 that they finally made the decision.\n\n“Everything fell into place very seamlessly for our move abroad at that point,” says Brittany, adding that they finally felt financially comfortable enough to relocate.\n\nThey’d initially been looking into a move to Chile, but after doing some research, the couple decided that Ecuador would be a better fit.\n\n“Ecuador had always kind of been on the back burner, not really on the forefront,” says Blake, pointing out that Chile’s borders were still closed to international travelers due to the restrictions brought about by Covid.\n\n“So, slowly but surely, as we did more and more research, I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is an amazing little country.’ And there were a lot more benefits to being here.”\n\nAmong these benefits were the fact that Ecuador was just a four-hour flight from Miami, used the US dollar as its official currency, and the cost of living was “quite low.”\n\n“It made a lot of sense on a practical level as well,” adds Blake, noting that the year-round temperate climate also played a part in their decision.\n\nThe couple then began the process of applying for “professional visas,” which are available to applicants with a university degree (or higher) and is valid for two years.\n\nHuge benefits\n\nThe Bowens say they have taken to life in Ecuador, but have faced various challenges since relocating. Brittany Bowen\n\nThe couple opted to hire an immigration lawyer to help them navigate their way through the proceedings.\n\n“Since we bought property here, we also could have qualified for an investors visa,” adds Brittany.\n\nIn late 2021, the Bowens set off from Washington with their four children, Aurora, Sebastian, Conrad, and Truett, who were aged between 11 and six at the time, for their new life in Ecuador.\n\n“We had told our families the end of March, and we got here in September,” says Brittany “So it was a very quick process.”\n\nThe Bowens say they felt at home in the country almost immediately.\n\n“After landing it was like, ‘OK, this is where we’re supposed to be,’” recounts Blake.\n\nAfter spending a lot of time researching the different areas of the country, they opted to base themselves in Loja, which has a closeknit community and is one of Ecuador’s oldest cities.\n\nThey went on to purchase a five-acre parcel of land filled with fruit trees and coffee plants, on the side of a mountain, which they found on Facebook marketplace.\n\n“Ecuadorians use Facebook for everything,” says Brittany. “So we’ve had to up our Facebook game since moving here.”\n\nThe Bowens, who have been chronicling their experiences on their YouTube account Average Family Abroad, spent their first year in the country focusing on building their three-bedroom home and getting to know the local community.\n\n“We had savings,” explains Brittany. “So we built the house and got used to life. And I’m really glad we did, because that was a really precious time.”\n\nThe couple say they spent around $100,000 on the land and roughly $55,000 on constructing their three-bedroom home, which has a balcony and a terrace.\n\n“The view is spectacular,” says Blake. “We stepped out the door and said, ‘This is a multi-million-dollar view.’”\n\nThe Bowens say they were welcomed into the community with open arms.\n\n“We could go on forever about the Ecuadorian people and how they’re just the most compelling people we’ve ever spent time with,” says Brittany.\n\n“And we’ve traveled a lot in Latin America, and just have a deep love for Latin America, South America, specifically.”\n\nBrittany, who was the only fluent Spanish speaker in the family when they first moved, was particularly thrilled to find that her “jokes were understood.”\n\n“Humor doesn’t always translate,” she points out. “Like, I can understand what someone said, but I don’t know why everyone’s laughing.\n\n“But that’s not the case here. I can make a joke and it’s received as a joke. People get it, and they’re laughing with me. That was a really delightful discovery.”\n\nOne of the things they admire most about Ecuadorians is the sense of pride many seem to have in their country, and Brittany and Blake have noticed that no one seems surprised that they chose to move there. In fact, they are often congratulated on the decision.\n\n“There’s so much we love about our life here,” says Brittany. “I’m actually a little surprised by how much the weather makes a difference in quality of life.\n\n“Our part of Ecuador is known as the ‘Valley of Eternal Spring,’ and living in constant spring is pretty fantastic.”\n\nThe Bowens spend a lot of time tending to their farm, and have been surprised to find that their fruit trees continue to produce year-round.\n\n“We never imagined that we’d be picking our own dragonfruits and pineapples, much less drinking our homegrown coffee,” says Brittany, before admitting that she and Blake have become “coffee snobs” as a result.\n\n“Now we drink a lot of US coffee, and we’re just horrified.”\n\nBrittany and Blake say they hope to one day be able to advance their homegrown coffee and perhaps look into importing to other countries.\n\n“Our region of Ecuador is famous for its coffee,” says Brittany. “It’s just outstanding quality.”\n\nCloseknit community\n\nThe family spend a lot of time tending to their five-acre farm. Brittany Bowen\n\nWhile their children were homeschooled in the US, the Bowens opted to enrol them in school in Ecuador.\n\n“No one in Ecuador homeschools,” explains Brittany. “So we could have continued to do that, and we always would have been outsiders… It would be a barrier. And we wanted to assimilate.”\n\nThis has ultimately proved to be a successful decision for the family, and the couple say that being “fellow school parents and participants in town life” has made them feel very much part of the community.\n\n“That’s been a big joy,” says Brittany. “And it’s also really good for things like security, because everyone watches out for you.”\n\nHowever, Brittany and Blake, who’ve both found remote work since moving, admit that adjusting to the Ecuadorian school system has been as tricky for them as it has been for their kids.\n\n“It’s interesting because they’re learning Ecuadorian history, not US history. And we’re not able to help them with that,” explains Brittany\n\nThey also note that “soccer is a really big thing here,” and their kids had “never kicked a ball in their life before moving.”\n\n“So our poor 13-year-old son is at a disadvantage, because his classmates have been playing since they could walk,” adds Brittany.\n\n“They play soccer on the little team in the town, but he’ll never catch up to his peers. It’s just for fun. Thankfully, kids are nice here.”\n\nAll four of the children now speak Spanish fluently, which is something the couple are hugely proud of.\n\n“We consider bilingualism to be a tremendous gift we can give our children,” says Brittany. “And biculturalism, being able to function and just appreciate another way of doing things, we think is really important.”\n\nThe couple say they’d advise anyone considering moving to a country like Ecuador to get to know the destination first and avoid being “rigid.”\n\n﻿“We’ve encountered quite a few kind of cranky expats who don’t seem to love or appreciate Ecuador or Ecuadorians,” says Brittany. “And that’s sort of heartbreaking, and kind of gives foreigners a bad name.”\n\nReflecting on her upbringing in the US, Brittany admits that she see things with a different lens having gone through the experience of moving to a foreign country.\n\n“I really wish I had reached out more to the immigrant kids at school and their families,” she says.\n\n“Because we’re benefiting from people reaching out to us. And it’s just that realization that I could have done better.”\n\nWhile the family have taken to life in Ecuador tremendously, they’ve faced various challenges since moving there, including flooding in their town.\n\nSafety factor\n\nAurora, Sebastian, Conrad, and Truett Bowen at Ingapirca in Ecuador's Cañar province. Brittany Bowen\n\nAnd in 2024, Ecuador was plunged into a nationwide state of emergency when one of its most powerful drug lords escaped from prison and an “internal armed conflict” broke out.\n\nVarious new state of emergencies have been announced since then, the most recent was renewed earlier this month.\n\nThe US State Department currently advises US citizens to “exercise increased caution in Ecuador due to civil unrest, crime, and kidnapping,” and avoid traveling to five areas of the country, including Guayaquil, “due to crime.”\n\nThe Bowens say they’ve been keeping an eye on the situation, and while it’s a “concern,” it hasn’t affected them so far.\n\n“Statistically speaking, up until these last couple of years, Ecuador actually has been one of the safest countries in South America, generally,” says Blake. “Even our province, the statistics are always incredibly low.\n\n“It’s a very safe area. And then we moved here, of course, and things start to ramp up post-pandemic.”\n\nThe couple say they’ve found that the “current struggles” are isolated to “a couple of pockets on the coast” admitting that if they didn’t watch the news, they’d likely have no idea that anything was wrong.\n\nHowever, Brittany and Blake are very aware that things can change at any moment.\n\n“In South America, there’s always a volatility,” says Brittany. “I think that goes with the region… And you accept that…\n\n“So we don’t know what’s going to happen. And we have plans. We’re prudent. But we also don’t live in fear…\n\n“One thing we do say is that in the United States, we would watch for exits in grocery stores. You look for hiding places.\n\n“Crime is random, and that scares us. Whereas here, it’s kind of a jaded statement, but there’s a logic behind the crime.”\n\nAlthough they have no plans to leave Ecuador, Brittany and Blake say they’ll continue to keep a watch “on the stability of the country,” and make any decisions if or when they have to.\n\n“We’re here to support Ecuador through the hard times too,” says Brittany. “But if we ever had to leave for a period of time with intent on coming back, we would go somewhere else in Latin America. The US wouldn’t even be on our radar.”\n\nAfter living outside of the country nearly four years, Brittany and Blake can’t ever envision themselves living in the US again, explaining that they don’t feel as though they’d be able to maintain a lifestyle even close to what they have there.\n\n“I mean, it’s expensive,” says Brittany, adding that their family can live comfortably in Ecuador for around $1,500 per month.\n\n“And people are angry there. We don’t like the divide. How people can’t be kind to each other. That’s very unappealing.”\n\nThe couple acknowledge that their children could potentially choose to return to the US for college in the future, but say that it’s not something that they necessarily want for them.\n\n“We feel like we kind of said ‘goodbye’ to that when we moved here,” says Brittany. “We don’t want the American Dream for our kids.\n\n”That doesn’t say they won’t pursue that on their own, and we support them whatever they choose to do.\n\n“But we’ve chosen a different way of life and a different future for our family… And we do think they will be super well equipped for whatever is in store for them.”",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nCongressional Republicans are grappling with how to respond to senior Trump administration officials’ use of a Signal group chat to discuss a military strike, with a key Senate committee requesting a watchdog probe of the matter as some in the GOP say there’s no need for further investigation.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Senate Armed Services Committee’s Republican chair and top Democrat formally requested an inquiry and assessment by the Pentagon’s acting inspector general into the incident.\n\n“This chat was alleged to have included classified information pertaining to sensitive military actions in Yemen. If true, this reporting raises questions as to the use of unclassified networks to discuss sensitive and classified information, as well as the sharing of such information with those who do not have proper clearance and need to know,” GOP Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed wrote in a letter.\n\nWicker and Reed had also requested a briefing for the committee.\n\nBut several GOP senators also on the Armed Services Committee insisted that it’s “time to move on,” arguing that such an incident won’t happen again and that the Trump officials involved in the Signal chat have learned from their mistakes.\n\n“It’s time to move on. The facts are not going to change. I don’t know that there are any more that could be revealed,” Sen. Kevin Cramer told reporters Thursday at the Capitol.\n\nCramer has been critical of the Signal chat incident, telling CNN on Tuesday, “this has got to be the last time something this big and dumb happens.”\n\n“Signal is an inappropriate platform to discuss highly sensitive information. They did that, and I’m quite confident it’s never going to happen again,” the North Dakota Republican added on Thursday.\n\nSome Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee insisted that no congressional investigation is “needed at this time” into the chat, which included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\n“I think that the secretary of defense has done a great job. If he wants to come and brief the committee, I think that’d be helpful. But I don’t see where an investigation is needed at this time,” GOP Rep. Cory Mills of Florida told CNN on Thursday.\n\nSenate Republican Leader John Thune did not explicitly call for a stand-alone Senate investigation on Tuesday, but told CNN’s Manu Raju that he anticipates the Senate Armed Services Committee may want those involved to testify before the panel.\n\n“I think everybody has acknowledged, including the White House, that yeah, mistakes were made. And what we want to do is make sure that something like that doesn’t happen again,” Thune said.\n\nSenate Republicans are working to strike a careful balance over the issue. Some have said that mistakes were made, but have also been cautious not to be too heavy-handed in their criticism or confrontational toward the administration.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson said on Wednesday that the Signal chat was a “mistake” but that the incident has been “overblown” by the media.\n\n“It’s been overblown, I think, by the media. I think this is a mistake. It was acknowledged as such. I’m certain it will not happen again. We move forward,” Johnson told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats have been calling for accountability and pushing for an investigation into the incident, which they argue endangered national security and US troops. A number of congressional Democrats have called for Hegseth to resign.\n\nHegseth has said that that there was no classified information discussed in the group chat.\n\nBut CNN has reported that the information that Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat was highly classified at the time he wrote it, especially because the operation had not even started yet, according to a US defense official familiar with the operation and another source who was briefed on it afterward.\n\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Thursday said she supports an investigation into the Signal group chat and that she’s still seeking “clarification” from top intelligence officials.\n\n“I definitely support an IG investigation on how all of these high-ranking members used a platform that is not appropriate for what they were discussing,” she told reporters, later adding, “Most of all we need to know how someone who should not have been on the call was able to be added to it.”\n\nCollins said while Signal messages are encrypted and “safer” than other forms of communication, the use in this case by officials is “still very problematic.”\n\n“There are a lot of issues that need follow-up, and I think that the IG is the one to do it.” Later Thursday, Wicker declined to comment to CNN on a timeline for the inspector general investigation or if he’d consider holding open hearings.\n\nCNN’s Lauren Fox, Alison Main and Haley Talbot contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to wade into the fraught legal battle over enforcing the Alien Enemies Act, the wartime authority he used to rapidly deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.\n\nThe emergency appeal, which asks the justices to overturn an order from US District Judge James Boasberg blocking further deportations under the act, further thrusts the Supreme Court into Trump’s whirlwind. It is perhaps the most significant matter now pending on the court’s docket dealing with his second term and it sits at the center of an explosive confrontation between the White House and the judiciary.\n\n“This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country – the President, through Article II, or the judiciary,” Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris told the Supreme Court. “The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President. The republic cannot afford a different choice.”\n\nLike other recent appeals, the Trump administration’s argument was heavy on complaints about lower courts standing in his way, handing down temporary orders that – while not resolving the challenges over the president’s power – have at least put some of his agenda on hold temporarily.\n\n“Only this Court can stop rule-by-TRO from further upending the separation of powers – the sooner, the better,” Harris wrote. “Here, the district court’s orders have rebuffed the President’s judgments as to how to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations.”\n\nThe Department of Justice also asked the Supreme Court for a temporary “administrative stay,” that would put Boasberg’s order on hold for a few days to give the justices time to review the case. Such a stay, if granted, would allow the administration to immediately restart deportations.\n\nThe court has asked the individuals challenging Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to respond to the emergency request by Tuesday.\n\nAt issue in the case is Trump’s invocation on March 15 of a wartime authority, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives him broad power to target and remove undocumented immigrants. The law grants that authority in times of war or when an enemy attempts an “invasion or predatory incursion.”\n\nSoon after Trump invoked the law, officials loaded up three planes with more than 200 Venezuelan nationals and flew them to El Salvador, where they are being housed in a maximum security prison. The administration has since said that some of those people were deported under authorities other than the 18th Century act. The Trump administration has said the men were affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe case lands at the high court days after Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare rebuke of Trump’s suggestion that Boasberg be impeached over his handling of the case.\n\n“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said in a statement released by the Supreme Court. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”\n\nWho sued and why\n\nFive Venezuelans still in the country who are being held by the Department of Homeland Security sued the administration, challenging its use of the law. Boasberg, nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, temporarily blocked the administration from any more deportations under the act while he considers the case – either against the five who sued, or anyone else in their situation.\n\nNotably, Boasberg’s order didn’t block the administration from deporting those same people under other laws, nor did it stop the administration from apprehending immigrants under the act.\n\nTrump nevertheless quickly appealed.\n\nThe DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 on Wednesday that Boasberg’s orders blocking Trump’s use of the sweeping wartime authority could stand while the legal challenge plays out. The majority included one judge nominated by President George H.W. Bush and another by Obama. It is that decision that Trump is appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\nUS Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, in a lengthy concurrence, offered the kind of textualist analysis that may find resonance with many of the court’s conservatives. She tore through Trump’s arguments that courts could not review the law’s enforcement and the notion that the flow of migrants over the US-Mexico border represents an invasion.\n\n“The term ‘invasion’ was well known to the Fifth Congress and the American public circa 1798,” she wrote. “The phrase echoes throughout the Constitution ratified by the people just nine years before. And in every instance, it is used in a military sense.”\n\nThe orders issued by Boasberg are set to expire on Saturday unless the judge agrees to extend them for two weeks. That extension would play out as Boasberg hears arguments over whether to issue a preliminary injunction – a more fulsome ruling on Trump’s use of the AEA that would help speed up the larger legal fight over his invocation of the law.\n\nAttorneys representing the Venezuelans who brought the lawsuit vowed later Friday to vigorously oppose the administration’s request before the Supreme Court.\n\n“This was never about immigration policy. This is about the president’s flagrant violation of the law, and his Justice Department’s search for a court that will rubber stamp it,” said Skye Perryman, an attorney with Democracy Forward. “We will continue to meet this administration in court to protect people and our democratic values.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Haberman says Trump's attacks have upset his own staff and other Republicans 05:05 - Source: CNN Haberman says Trump's attacks have upset his own staff and other Republicans 05:05\n\nTrump misreads precedent?\n\nWhen the Supreme Court last considered the Alien Enemies Act, in 1948, it gave President Harry Truman broad deference to decide when the law could be invoked. Truman had sought to remove a German national and the appeal arrived at the Supreme Court three years after the end of World War II.\n\nWar, the court reasoned at that time, isn’t necessarily over “when the shooting stops.” It was the president, the Supreme Court said, that determined when a war was over.\n\nStephen Miller, who is Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy, and others in the administration appear to have interpreted that decision as disallowing any court review of how a president implements the law. But Henderson shot down that reading in her concurrence on Wednesday.\n\n“The elected branches – not the unelected bench – decide when a war has terminated. That is a question of fact for elected leaders,” she wrote. “That does not mean that courts cannot pass on the legal meaning of statutory terms.”\n\nThe emergency appeal is the third pending on the high court’s emergency docket from the second Trump administration. The Department of Justice has also asked the court to limit the scope of an order temporarily barring Trump from enforcing his effort to end birthright citizenship. And, more recently, administration asked the court to allow it to freeze millions of dollars in grants to states for addressing teacher shortages.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

Those allegations were alleged to have occurred in January and February.\n\nBut following his latest arrest, a judge ordered him jailed without bond.

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump took his most consequential action against federal employee unions yet late Thursday, signing an executive order aimed at ending collective bargaining for government employees whose work include national security aspects.\n\nThe expansive order applies to workers across many federal agencies, including the departments of State, Defense, Justice and Health and Human Services. It also impacts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Communications Commission, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nA fact sheet released by the White House said, “The President needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national security.”\n\nThe order is aimed at stopping federal unions who have “declared war on President Trump’s agenda,” according to the fact sheet. It noted that the largest union – the American Federation of Government Employees – has filed many grievances to “block Trump policies.”\n\n“President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests,” the fact sheet said, noting that the president is using authority granted by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n\nA guidance issued Thursday by the Office of Personnel Management said that the agencies and divisions covered by the executive order no longer need to collectively bargain with federal unions. It noted that the agencies can conduct the widespread reduction in force, or RIF, that Trump had previously ordered without regard to provisions in terminated collective bargaining agreements. Likewise, any procedural restrictions on agencies’ return-to-office mandates won’t be in effect after the agreements are terminated.\n\nAFGE, which represents more than 800,000 employees, condemned the move in a statement Thursday evening, noting that it affects the collective bargaining rights of more than 1 million federal employees.\n\n“President Trump’s latest executive order is a disgraceful and retaliatory attack on the rights of hundreds of thousands of patriotic American civil servants—nearly one-third of whom are veterans—simply because they are members of a union that stands up to his harmful policies,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in the statement.\n\n“AFGE is preparing immediate legal action and will fight relentlessly to protect our rights, our members, and all working Americans from these unprecedented attacks,” Kelley said.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union also vowed to take swift action.\n\n“The executive order to eliminate collective bargaining rights for federal employees across the government is a brazen attempt by the administration to ensure its reckless assault on vital federal agency services can continue unimpeded,” NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement. “We will vigorously challenge this illegal order in court.”\n\nSince taking office, Trump has sought to reshape the federal workforce. In one of his earliest moves, he ended remote work for government employees and agencies were provided guidance on how they can override union collective bargaining agreements on telework and remote work.\n\nEarlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security announced moves to rescind the collective bargaining agreement covering tens of thousands of transportation security officers at airports.\n\nFederal unions have fought back, filing multiple lawsuits in federal court – several of which have succeeded in stymieing Trump’s agenda, at least for a short time. Lawsuits filed by AFGE and other unions have temporarily reversed the administration’s laying off tens of thousands of probationary workers at certain federal agencies and blocked Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive Social Security data, among other consequential rulings.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "title": "Officials say texts sent by Waltz and Ratcliffe in Signal chat may have damaged US’ ongoing ability to gather intel on Houthis",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nCurrent and former US officials have told CNN they believe two texts sent by national security adviser Mike Waltz and CIA Director John Ratcliffe in the now-infamous group chat involving senior US officials discussing battle plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, may have done long-term damage to the US’s ability to gather intelligence on the Iran-backed group going forward.\n\nAlthough messages from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth detailing the sequencing, timing and weapons to be used in a March attack on the Houthis have drawn the most scrutiny because they could have endangered US servicemembers if revealed, the messages from Waltz and Ratcliffe, in the chat Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg was added to, contained equally sensitive information, these sources said.\n\nIn one of the messages, Ratcliffe told other Cabinet members who were discussing whether to delay the strikes that the CIA was in the act of mobilizing assets to collect intelligence on the group, but that a delay might offer them the opportunity to “identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.”\n\nThat text, according to the current and former officials, exposed the mere fact that the US is gathering intelligence on them — bad in and of itself — but also hinted at how the agency is doing it. The language about “starting points,” these people said, suggests clearly that the CIA is using technical means like overhead surveillance to spy on their leadership. That could allow the Houthis to change their practices to better protect themselves.\n\nThen, in a later message, Waltz offered an extremely specific after-action report of the strikes, telling the thread that the military had “positive ID” of a particular senior Houthi leader “walking into his girlfriend’s building” — offering the Houthis a clear opportunity to see who the US was surveilling and potentially figure out how, thus enabling them to avoid that surveillance in the future, the sources said.\n\nThe Houthis have “always been difficult to track,” said a former intelligence official. “Now you just highlight for them that they’re in the crosshairs.”\n\nTrump administration officials, including both Waltz and Ratcliffe, have repeatedly insisted that no classified information was shared in the text. Ratcliffe, in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, specifically referenced his text about “starting points.”\n\nBut current and former officials have disagreed vehemently with that assessment: The kinds of information in not just Hegseth’s texts, but Ratcliffe’s and Waltz’s, included very clear references to sources and methods. Even if it wasn’t an explicit or technical description, these people say, it is information that the US government would typically withhold because it might allow an adversary to make an educated interference about US sources and methods.\n\nRatcliffe’s use of the Signal app in this way is raising eyebrows inside Langley, current and former officials said.\n\n“I think he is going to be viewed skeptically for using the app for that purpose,” one US official told CNN.\n\n“(Ratcliffe) was basically talking as if he was in a SCIF,” said another former intelligence official, referring to a secure room hardened against electronic surveillance that is designed for discussions of classified material.\n\n“He’s the director,” said the first former official, calling Ratcliffe’s text “irresponsible.” “He should know better.”\n\nA CIA spokesperson told CNN, “Director Ratcliffe takes his responsibility to safeguard America’s ability to gather intelligence extremely seriously.”\n\n“Nothing he conveyed in the chat posed any risk to any sources or methods,” the spokesperson said. “The only lasting damage is to the Houthi terrorists who have been eliminated.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council for comment.\n\nCareer officials provided a ‘reminder’ on Signal use\n\nThe use of Signal — an unclassified, nongovernment platform that officials say is potentially vulnerable to foreign hackers — for this kind of sensitive conversation was so alarming to career CIA officials that they provided a gentle “reminder” to people on Ratcliffe’s staff on Wednesday, two officials familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nCIA regulations permit the use of Signal on both work phones, and, under a rule change during the Biden administration last year, on desktop computers as well, according to US officials. It’s not only approved, but encouraged, to communicate basic logistical movements, like who is available to come into the office or what time to hold a meeting.\n\nBoth Ratcliffe and Gabbard testified on Capitol Hill this week that Signal was pre-loaded on their computer when they arrived for their first day on the job.\n\nAnd the app is widely-used across government, seen as a more secure way of communicating because it is end-to-end encrypted.\n\n“Everyone is on Signal, all day and night,” one official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations in the West Wing.\n\nBiden administration officials also routinely used it to discuss logistical planning for meetings and at times to communicate with foreign counterparts.\n\nTrust in the security of Signal is bolstered by the fact that the app is open source, meaning its code is available for independent experts to scrutinize for vulnerabilities. But like any messaging app with high-value targets, state-backed hackers have tried to find a way into Signal chats – leaving open the possibility that it may be vulnerable to prying eyes.\n\nA report last month from Google-owned security firm Mandiant found that Russian-linked spies had tried to break into the Signal accounts of Ukrainian military personnel by posing as trusted Signal contacts.\n\nAt least at the CIA, it’s prohibited to discuss operational matters on Signal. And other national security agencies have reportedly also issued warnings that it is not foolproof, and it is certainly not a replacement for classified networks.\n\n“It’s the most secure (commercial messaging app) but not sanctioned for classified information,” said one US official. “And be careful of sensitive information that is not classified.”\n\n“There are ways to effectively use Signal for alignment, but you just can’t cross that line of classified data for obvious reasons,” said another US official.\n\nYet, even in the wake of what both current and former officials — and some members of Congress — say was a catastrophic mistake, as of now, there seem to be little official reaction to the breach, as would be expected under past administrations. The CIA has not been tasked with conducting a damage assessment to determine whether any sources and methods were exposed by the breach — and what the risk would be if they were — and as of right now, the Defense Department is not expected to make any changes to its security protocols because, according to one senior military official, “that would be construed as admitting wrongdoing.”\n\nThe National Security Council, led by Waltz, has undertaken a review of how The Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally added to the chain.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News earlier this week, Waltz said he takes “take full responsibility” for the incident because he “built the group” but in the next breath disparaged The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg while offering conflicting and garbled explanations for how his number came to be in his phone.\n\nAnd President Donald Trump has suggested publicly that Signal might be “defective,” but it’s not clear whether there will be any review of the regulations or policies surrounding official use of the app.\n\nAt the same time, Trump and his top officials who participated in the chat continue to publicly downplay the sensitivity of the information itself and the inherent risks associated with disseminating it through unclassified channels in attempt to weather the ongoing political firestorm.\n\nBut it was Ratcliffe who testified earlier this week that “pre-decisional strike deliberation should be conducted through classified channels,” a rare, but tacit acknowledgment of what current and former officials insist is obvious: some of the information should have never been shared in a Signal group chat.\n\nCNN’s Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.",

Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats have seized on the planned layoffs at the VA and any impact on services for veterans, who often enjoy widespread, bipartisan support. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Richard Blumenthal is planning a series of so-called “shadow hearings,” or unofficial hearings held by the minority party, on VA cuts starting next week.\n\nBlumenthal, the ranking member on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, took to the Senate floor Thursday to decry “real-life impacts … to our nation’s heroes.” The Connecticut Democrat said: “It is a disgrace. It is shameful.”\n\nAccording to Secretary Collins, the VA has four employees who act as liaisons to DOGE, which has been at the center of Elon Musk-led efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.\n\n“They are working to streamline operations, improve management, and are also examining contracts,” Collins wrote in a letter this week to Blumenthal.\n\nBlumenthal had raised concerns about DOGE gaining access to federal databases and systems and the vulnerability of veterans’ health records and other private information. Collins responded that the VA is committed to safeguarding veterans’ data. “To be very clear: DOGE does not have access to Veterans’ personal records,” Collins wrote.\n\nIn recent weeks, the VA along with DOGE have moved to cancel hundreds of contracts, though some have since been put under review for possible reinstatement, according to congressional sources familiar with those efforts.\n\nVeterans advocates also have questions about the impact of changes at the VA.\n\n“We’ve expressed our concerns with the potential RIF both publicly and directly with VA… We’re now anticipating official word from VA on what it determines through its assessment and look forward to a plan that ensures VA can continue to deliver timely care and benefits,” Randi K. Law, senior director of marketing communications for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in a statement, adding that “VFW members and veterans all agree there are places where VA needs to be more efficient.”\n\nAmong the medical and health care support staff targeted for layoffs at the VA are non-patient facing administrative roles, contract positions in VA medical centers and certain research positions, congressional sources said.\n\nStaffers on Capitol Hill who have been in contact with VA employees told CNN that the agency has already terminated some supply clerks at VA medical facilities. These are people who, among their other duties, handle re-stocking of surgical supplies for operating rooms. Their departure increases the burden on nurses and other staff to handle those duties, they said.\n\nThe layoff plan also includes a large scaling-back of Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN’s). These are smaller, regional VA offices that provide oversight of the VA’s medical facilities across the country and handle telehealth support and call centers.\n\nThe VA employees being targeted for layoffs in “administrative and support roles” could include medical appointment schedulers, billing specialists, policy and program analysts and human resources personnel, sources said.\n\nThey point out that the VA’s Human Resources offices had already been severely under-staffed for many years and were just starting to build back up. “This is exceptionally short-sighted,” one congressional staffer told CNN. “Not only does HR assist with hiring staff, but also processing firing, demotion, promotion, and disciplinary actions; assisting employees with benefits and retirement, and more.”\n\nThe layoffs will come in waves over the next few months, the sources said. Specific employees at risk of being fired will start being identified in April and May. Impacted employees will be notified in June.\n\nThe first round of layoffs will begin in July, and a second round will begin in September. Assessments will be taken after each round to evaluate disruptions. Some affected employees will transition into new roles, and the department plans to help some affected workers seek other federal employment.",

        "title": "Her research revealed a safety concern with a vaccine. Then the NIH pulled her funding",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nOn March 10, Dr. Nisha Acharya got a letter from the National Institutes of Health terminating her grant to study the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine recommended for all adults 50 and older in the US.\n\nThe grant was canceled after a change in NIH policy to not “prioritize research activities that focus on gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” according to the termination letter.\n\nThe policy shift was no surprise: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, now leads the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWhat was surprising about her grant cancellation is that she’s not studying vaccine hesitancy.\n\nRather, in a written description of her research, Acharya said, “I had the words ‘hesitancy’ and ‘vaccine’ in the same sentence.”\n\nShe thinks her funding was caught in a dragnet of NIH grant cancellations driven by haphazard, error-prone word searches rather than careful review of the research in question. HHS has not clarified how it is selecting grants for termination.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the NIH has canceled at least two dozen grants to researchers who were looking at ways to increase vaccination rates or fight vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThe changes come as scientists and universities are already reeling from cuts to funding for research about climate science, HIV and many other topics.\n\nFor Acharya, the cancellation wipes out just over three years of funding on her current grant that she says is worth almost $2 million in direct and indirect costs.\n\nAs a result, she plans to lay off three full-time employees who were working with her to analyze large amounts of data related to the vaccine. Acharya, a clinician scientist at the University of California at San Francisco, will keep her job seeing patients, although the grant paid about 35% of her salary, which she used for time to conduct research.\n\n“I don’t have a way of continuing this work,” said Acharya, who is planning to appeal the decision.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy, a lawyer, testified that he was “pro-safety” and “pro-good science.” He denied being anti-vaccine and has said he wants people to know the risks and benefits of the vaccinations before they get them, a principle called informed consent.\n\nThat’s what Acharya wants, too. She believes that studies on vaccine hesitancy are valid and worthwhile and should continue to be funded — but it’s not what she’s studying.\n\n“I’m not anti-vax. I am pro-science, whether it’s positives or negatives,” she said. “I understand that with any medicine, any vaccine, there may be things that are very good and things that people may need to be cautious about. That is the goal, right?”\n\nResearch halted\n\nAcharya is an ophthalmologist, or eye doctor, who studies inflammatory diseases of the eye. Until March 10, she was studying the benefits and risks of the shingles vaccine, particularly as it relates to an infection called herpes zoster ophthalmicus: shingles in the nerves around the eye. This complication is painful and can lead to blindness.\n\nAbout 1 in 3 adults will have shingles at some point in their lives, and Acharya said that 10% to 20% of those cases will involve shingles of the eye.\n\nThe clinical trials that test vaccines can tell researchers whether a shot will generally be effective at preventing the more severe complications of an infection. Clinical trials can also catch common safety issues.\n\nBut rare side effects and adverse events from vaccines often aren’t picked up until they’re launched across the population and used by hundreds of thousands of people of different ages and sexes and with different underlying conditions.\n\nAcharya was studying all those questions related to the Shingrix vaccine, which landed on the US market in 2018. It is recommended for all adults 50 and older to prevent painful bouts of shingles, a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox.\n\nAcharya said she saw an opportunity to gather more data. “Those trials that led to FDA approval did not include people who had had shingles already. They don’t really include people who are sick or had a lot of medical problems.\n\n“We need to really understand how well the vaccine is working for different age groups, for different people, maybe people who have different comorbidities or different conditions, like who are immunocompromised, people who already have had shingles, already have had shingles on the eye. There’s all these questions that we have no data for, no information,” she added.\n\nMembers of Acharya's research team at UCSF Courtesy Nisha Acharya\n\nShe applied for and won a grant through the NIH to study these questions. It’s a highly competitive process that requires months of work to prepare and submit, and goes through rounds of review from peers before it’s awarded.\n\nAfter her first five-year grant, Acharya was able to show that her work had produced important findings: for example, that the vaccine was safe and effective at preventing shingles – including around the eye – in people who had not had it before. So the NIH awarded her another round of five-year funding to continue.\n\nShe said she wanted her second round of research to dig into a question that made her fellow ophthalmologists hesitant to recommend the vaccine to their patients: Many of them had seen people who got the vaccine experience a dangerous reawakening of the virus in their eyes. Was it a coincidence or a real risk?\n\n“I’m in a very specialized field, and we actually have a little bit of concern in this very specialized subgroup of people who already have shingles in the eye,” Acharya said.\n\nAcharya wanted to see whether it was true that the vaccine could trigger another bout of shingles inflammation. In a recent study published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, she showed that it could — an important safety consideration. GSK did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the study.\n\nIn the study, Acharya urged more monitoring of patients. She imagined that this data might eventually be used to refine recommendations about who should get the vaccine. But it was just the first study; more research is needed for such a change.\n\nStill, her grant was cancelled.\n\nHHS didn’t answer specific questions about how it was deciding to terminate grants.\n\n“HHS is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities. At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science. As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” an HHS official said in a statement to CNN.\n\nAcharya calls it “ironic” that her grant was flagged. “I never got to explain.”\n\nShe says the program officers overseeing her grant at the NIH knew her work well, and “they didn’t have any part in this decision.”\n\nA chance to appeal\n\nThe letter gives her 30 days to appeal the termination if she believes that it was made in error, and the appeal goes directly to Dr. Matthew Memoli, who has been acting director of the agency while new NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya was awaiting confirmation.\n\nWhat really makes Acharya sad is the effect of the funding cuts on her colleagues.\n\n“I can’t save them,” she said. “I’m trying to call people and try to get jobs for them. I’m trying to set up interviews and stuff, but it’s really hard.”\n\nUniversities have lost so much federal research funding that many are coping with their own grant cancellations and doing their own belt-tightening. There’s a hiring freeze at UCSF.\n\n“It’s not these people’s fault that they ended up being in a research group that was good, it was so promising, and their careers would have been made, and now it’s gone, and they’re gonna be out of a job,” she said.",

        "title": "Utah becomes the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "AP —\n\nUtah has become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, over opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warn the move will lead to medical problems and disproportionately affect low-income communities.\n\nRepublican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation late Thursday that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.\n\nFluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUtah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Cox, who grew up and raised his own children in a community without fluoridated water, compared it recently to being “medicated” by the government.\n\nThe ban, which is effective May 7, comes weeks after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.\n\nThe American Dental Association sharply criticized Cox and Utah lawmakers, saying the ban showed “wanton disregard for the oral health and well-being of their constituents.”\n\nThe group said that cavities are the most common chronic childhood disease.\n\n“As a father and a dentist, it is disheartening to see that a proven, public health policy, which exists for the greater good of an entire community’s oral health, has been dismantled based on distorted pseudoscience,” said the association’s president, Denver dentist Brett Kessler.\n\nLawmakers in states including Ohio, South Carolina and Florida also have made proposals to restrict local governments or water system operators from adding fluoride to water.\n\nProposed restrictions on fluoridation in New Hampshire, Tennessee and North Dakota were rejected. A measure in Kentucky to make fluoridation optional stalled in the state Senate.\n\nFluoridation is considered the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale. More than 200 million people in the U.S., or almost two-thirds of the population, receive fluoridated water through community water. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\n\nBut some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to the intellectual development of children.\n\nThe president of the American Dental Association, Brett Kessler, has said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water are below levels considered problematic.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health says very high doses of fluoride that can cause sickness are typically the result of rare accidents, such as the unintentional swallowing of fluoride use by dentists’ offices or supplements inappropriately given to children. The agency says it’s “virtually impossible” to get a toxic dose that could cause systemic health problems from fluoride that’s added to water or toothpaste at standard levels.\n\nOpponents warn the ban will disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.\n\nThe sponsor of the Utah legislation, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of “individual choice” to not have it in the water.\n\nOut of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state’s biggest city, Salt Lake City.\n\nUtah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nTariffs are looming, inflation is still sticky and US consumers are bracing themselves for the impact.\n\nThat’s according to data released Friday from the Commerce Department: Americans socked away money into savings, pulled back on discretionary purchases, and, when accounting for inflation, increased their spending ever so slightly after taking a breather in a frigid and post-holiday January.\n\nAt the same time, inflation data showed minimal progress on the easing of price hikes.\n\nBut the most comprehensive economic data to date on how prices are changing and how consumers are earning, spending and saving doesn’t fully account for the elephant in the room: President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policy.\n\nRecently imposed tariffs on auto imports and a slew of other levies waiting in the wings stand to weigh on consumer spending — America’s economic engine — and drive prices higher, economists warn.\n\n“There is no other conclusion possible other than the Trump 2.0 economic policies are frightening consumers as much as they do corporations,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds wrote in a note on Friday. “The economy is going to stall out if not something worse if Washington policymakers are not careful.”\n\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose 2.5% in February from the year before, holding steady with what was seen in January, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3%, unchanged from January.\n\nEconomists expected that falling energy prices and stabilizing food prices would help keep the disinflationary trend at hand, and that was indeed the case: Energy prices fell 1.1% for the month while food prices eased just slightly to 1.5% from 1.6%.\n\nForecasts called for the PCE price index to be unchanged from January’s preliminary 2.5% rate.\n\nHowever, one critical barometer — the core PCE index, which serves as a gauge of underlying inflation — came in slightly hotter than economists expected.\n\nExcluding food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile, the closely watched core PCE price index rose 0.4% for the month and 2.8% from a year before, accelerating from 2.7% in January.\n\n“[The core PCE price index] has been trading in a band of 2.6% to 2.8% for 10 months — it’s just plain moving sideways,” Dan North, senior economist for Allianz Trade North America, said in an interview. “We’re going nowhere. Inflation is really very sticky, not having moved for 10 months, and that puts the [Federal Reserve] in an increasingly awkward spot.”\n\nThe Fed last week kept interest rates unchanged, and Chair Jerome Powell indicated that central bankers are waiting for more evidence that inflation is headed toward their 2% target — or that the economy is weakening — before they return to cutting rates.\n\nPowell acknowledged that “it remains seen” how uncertainty swelling around Trump’s aggressive economic agenda affects future spending and investment.\n\nAmericans cutting back on discretionary purchases\n\nExcluding the effects of inflation, consumer spending rebounded in February, rising 0.4% for the month. In January, spending was weaker than initially reported and fell by 0.3%.\n\nWhere consumers put those dollars was especially telling: They shelled out more for goods — likely reflecting the “pull forward” of buying products before tariffs hit, economists say — while pulling back sharply on services spending, such as eating out and traveling.\n\n“Heightened uncertainty around the economic outlook, fears of accelerating inflation, and the declines in the equity market are depressing consumer confidence and now we see signs that the ‘soft’ survey data are starting to weigh on the ‘hard’ economic data,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist of Nationwide, wrote Friday. “It was particularly telling that consumers pulled back on discretionary service expenditures, recording the first decline since January 2022.”\n\nHowever, when adjusting for inflation, spending in February was up a mere 0.1%.\n\nFriday’s report, however, did provide a silver lining for household finances: Incomes climbed by 0.8% for the month and and disposable income (after taxes) was up 0.9% and 0.5% after adjusting for inflation. Consumers opted to put a good chunk in their piggy banks: The personal saving rate increased to 4.6% from a revised 4.3% rate in January.\n\n“Obviously, consumers remain jittery given spending remains subdued and savings high, but as long as incomes keep growing there’s money to spend, which will support the economy and help Americans deal with persistent inflation,” Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote Friday.\n\n“While inflation ticked up, we have yet to know and feel the full effect of tariffs, especially on autos, and how much they will raise prices,” he added.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Bangkok, Thailand CNN —\n\nA 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit the heart of war-ravaged Myanmar of Friday, killing scores of people and prompting the country’s military junta to make a rare plea for international assistance.\n\nThe earthquake cut through a vast and varied corner of Southeast Asia, sending terrifying tremors through rural villages caught in the middle of Myanmar’s civil war all the way to the glitzy high-rises of the traffic-filled Thai capital Bangkok. Shaking was even felt across the border in China’s southwestern remote and mountainous Yunnan province.\n\nAt least 144 people have been killed and more than 730 others were injured, the head of Myanmar’s military government said late Friday evening. Deaths have also been reported in Thailand.\n\nHaving largely shut the country off from the world during its four years of civil war, Min Aung Hlaing – the leader of Myanmar’s military government – declared a state of emergency and issued an “open invitation to any organizations and nations willing to come and help the people in need within our country,” adding the toll was likely to rise.\n\nWith electricity and internet down in parts of Myanmar, Hlaing’s unexpected call for help is a measure of the devastation the quake has wrought in the country his junta has helped turn into a pariah state.\n\nRescue efforts are likely to vary hugely between the two countries. Myanmar, one of Asia’s poorest nations, has a long and troubled track record of struggling to respond to major natural disasters. In contrast, neighboring Thailand is far more prosperous and a major tourist destination, with well-resourced and experienced rescue teams.\n\nThe quake was felt hundreds of miles away from the epicenter near the city of Mandalay in northern Myanmar. Erik Honan, a US citizen visiting a friend in the southern Thai city of Pattaya, said when he saw items begin to slide on a coffee table early Friday, he “knew immediately what it was.”\n\n“Mother Nature was having its way – like swatting a fly,” Honan told CNN.\n\nVideo posted online showed panicked residents across Myanmar and Thailand running from swaying residential towers as dust fills the air, and traffic comes to a sudden stop on busy city streets.\n\nThailand’s prime minister also declared an “emergency zone” in Bangkok after the quake triggered the collapse of an under-construction high-rise building near the city’s Chatuchak Park. The collapse killed at least eight people, according to Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, and rescuers are working to free at least 110 people still trapped under the rubble.\n\nSunan Kenkiat, a 31-year-old construction worker at the site, described his narrow escape from the building before it pancaked.\n\n“It was shaking and I felt dizzy,” Kenkiat told CNN. “After that, debris like cement pieces started falling down, and the shaking got stronger, so I shouted for everyone to run.”\n\nThis screengrab taken from a video shows a building collapse in Bangkok, Thailand, on March 28, 2025, following an earthquake centered in neighboring Myanmar. A portion of the image has been blurred by CNN. Obtained from Social Media\n\n‘Disaster on top of disaster’ for Myanmar\n\nMyanmar is already reeling from four years of civil war sparked by a bloody and economically destructive military coup, which has seen junta forces battle rebel groups across the country. The coup and ensuing conflict has battered its health infrastructure, leaving it ill-equipped to deal with major natural disasters.\n\nSwathes of the country lie outside the control of the junta and are a run by a patchwork of ethnic rebels and militias, making compiling reliable information extremely difficult.\n\nThe full extent of the damage is still emerging. Amnesty International has urged the ruling junta to allow aid groups to enter freely, saying the quake “could not come at a worse time” for the war-ravaged country.\n\nTom Andrew, the United Nations special rapporteur for Myanmar, said the quake would pile “a disaster on top of a disaster.” With more than 20 million people already in need of humanitarian aid and some 3.5 million internally displaced, “I shudder to think what will be happening in the next few days as rescue operations kick in,” Andrews told CNN.\n\nA resident of Mandalay told CNN they weren’t sure they would survive the quake.\n\n“The quake was very powerful, we could not run out of the building immediately,” said Tun Kyaw, 26, asking to use a pseudonym.\n\n“It was like the whole building was going to collapse. I was not sure I would get out alive.”\n\nThe quake hit around 12:50 p.m. local time close to Mandalay, the former royal capital that is home to about 1.5 million people and boasts a host of historic temple complexes and palaces. Several aftershocks have since struck nearby, including one of 6.4-magnitude, according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\nThe epicenter was recorded in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region, which has been ravaged by the civil war, with the junta, pro-military militia and rebel groups battling for control and all running checkpoints, making travel by road or river extremely difficult.\n\nSagaing is largely rural with dwellings mostly built with wood and thatch. Communications in the area are typically patchy due to intermittent fighting between the junta and rebel groups.\n\nMedical workers treat an earthquake survivor in the compound of a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar. Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the town of Taungoo, 70 miles south of the capital Naypyidaw, three people were killed after a mosque partially collapsed, Reuters reported.\n\nOne resident in Yangon, Myanmar’s commercial hub and around 380 miles away from the epicenter, told CNN: “We felt the quake for about one minute and then we ran out of the building.”\n\n“We saw other people running out of the buildings too. It was very sudden and very strong.”\n\nAnother resident said phone networks in the city home to around 8 million people were briefly down following the quake, but were now working again.\n\nA Yangon resident named Wang, who was on the 20th floor of a building when the quake hit, said “people next to me were all scared to death.”\n\n“The quake felt so strong, and lasted really long,” said Wang, who did not want to give her first name.\n\nVideo obtained by CNN from Myanmar appeared to show a road bridge spanning the Irrawaddy River, which runs through Mandalay, collapsing into the river in a cloud of dust and water.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nEven before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s car crash meeting at the White House last month, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer had talked confidently of putting British boots on the ground in Ukraine - widely understood to mean land forces - in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.\n\nAfter the Washington mauling, Starmer – along with French President Emmanuel Macron and other European leaders - quickly doubled down on their pledges of support for Ukraine’s leader.\n\n“This is not a moment for more talk,” Starmer said following a major gathering of heads of state and government leaders in London the next day. “It is time to act.”\n\nNow, though, four weeks on and after two further major meetings of European leaders, the overwhelming sense is that of a process inexorably slowing down. We should probably not be surprised.\n\nThe preferred terminology now is of a “reassurance force” for Ukraine – talk of European “peacekeepers” is no longer in the lexicon. Such a force would not act on the front line, Macron told reporters after Thursday’s meeting in Paris, and it would not act on behalf of Ukrainian forces.\n\nRecent reports have suggested that London, in particular, might be going cool on the idea of putting troops on the ground in Ukraine, but Macron insisted nothing has so far been ruled out.\n\n“We are looking into the air, at sea, and on the ground as well. Nothing is excluded,” he said, adding, “that (reassurance) force will be deployed in Ukraine.”\n\nUkrainian soldiers man an MSTA-B howitzer near Niu York, in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, on March 5, 2025. Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nFurther details will come in due course, but French and British military chiefs now have the task of working with their Ukrainian counterparts to establish the number of troops that would make up such a force and where they might be located, as well as their capabilities, he said.\n\nIn military parlance, it is time to get to work on the “operating concept” that would underpin any such force. What are the possible threats that it would likely face? What would be the rules of engagement?\n\nThese are not simple matters and will likely take weeks to nail down. Inevitably, answers to those questions need to assume limited, or non-existent, US participation, which will likely further slow down planning.\n\nFor Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former defense minister of Ukraine, ambitions need to be realistic.\n\nHe points to the obvious logistical challenges presented by his country’s massive 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line with Russia, and the low probability that Starmer and Macron would approve rules of engagement that could see European troops entering into direct combat with Russian soldiers. A forward deployment of British or French land forces would be an ineffective endeavor, he warns, but so too could a less far-reaching commitment.\n\n“There have been so many discussions that Europe would step in and help with security arrangements, but if they end up sending 10,000 people to stay in Kyiv, unable to leave the city, that’s certainly not going to change anything in Russia’s calculations,” he told CNN.\n\nIn fact, with a negligible deterrence effect, such a move could actually make Europe emerge weaker. The temptation for Russia to humiliate London and Paris - by breaking any ceasefire with an attack carried out hundreds of miles away from British and French troops stuck in the capital - could prove hard to resist.\n\nThe wreckage of cars remains in a residential district at the site of a Russian drone attack on March 27, 2025 in Dnipro, Ukraine. Yurii Tynnyi/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images\n\nIn a paper written for the London-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank, Zagorodnyuk, along with two colleagues, argues that a better option for Europe could be “airmen boots” on the ground – a commitment to police Ukraine’s skies from Russian strikes.\n\nSuch a protection would almost certainly mean British, French and other warplanes stationed in Ukraine, along with aircrews and accompanying logistical support. It might be that Europe only provided cover over western and central Ukraine, he says, but even that would at least allow Ukraine to devote all of its forces to defending the eastern part of the country.\n\nEven a reassurance force that extended no further than putting air assets inside Ukraine would still be a major step for Europe. But the potential credibility risks, while still extant, would surely be lower than with any deployment of land forces.\n\nAt the same time, Europe needs to be extremely careful. Managing expectations in the run-up to any possible announcement is also key. The credibility of any eventual deployment will be judged to a considerable extent on how it measures up to what had been previously discussed in public.\n\nIf it appears to fall too short, it won’t just be Ukraine that feels short-changed. Putin and Trump will also have their suspicions confirmed that Europe is a dead duck.",

        "title": "Concerns about Hegseth’s judgment come roaring back after group chat scandal",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nEver since news broke on Monday that top Trump officials discussed US military attack plans in a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has projected unflinching confidence.\n\n“I know exactly what I’m doing,” Hegseth told reporters Tuesday.\n\nBy Wednesday, however, other defense officials were increasingly skeptical of that, especially after The Atlantic magazine revealed the details that Hegseth shared in the Signal chat about the pending strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen, including the timing and types of aircraft.\n\n“It is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court-martialed for this,” a defense official told CNN. “My most junior analysts know not to do this.”\n\nNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz has been criticized for inviting Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg into the chat. And CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom were on the Signal chat, were grilled over two days of Congressional testimony.\n\nBut former national security and intelligence officials say it’s Hegseth who looks particularly bad given the level of detail he shared.\n\n“The egregious actor here is Hegseth,” said one former senior intelligence official. “He’s in the bullseye now because he puts all this out on a Signal chat.”\n\nInterviews with multiple current and former national security officials this week, including career military and civilian officials, reflect growing concerns about Hegseth’s leadership at the Pentagon.\n\nThe group chat scandal is the latest in a series of what some officials say are examples of questionable judgment by the former Fox News host, as he has struggled to implement consistent and durable policies across the Defense Department in his first two months as secretary.\n\nSo far, several high-profile initiatives spearheaded by Hegseth inside DoD since he was confirmed in January— including several related to the southern border mission and a purge of “DEI” content—have either been scaled back or rescinded as he has rushed to implement changes demanded by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nThe current and former officials said the rocky start underscores both Hegseth’s inexperience and his freewheeling approach to leadership. Many of his orders are verbal and based on gut instinct rather than a deliberative, multi-layered process, people familiar with his methods said.\n\n“He’s a TV personality,” one of the sources said. “[A general officer] makes a recommendation, and he’s like, ‘Yeah, yeah, go do it.’ [Former Defense Secretary] Lloyd Austin would never be like, ‘Yeah, yeah, go do it.’ He’d be like, ‘We’ll take it under consideration.’”\n\nSeveral DoD officials told CNN that Hegseth seems more preoccupied with appearances than with substance—wanting to appear more “lethal” than his predecessor and pulling resources from elsewhere in DoD to achieve that image.\n\n“Your job is to make sure that it’s lethality, lethality, lethality,” Hegseth told reporters late last year. “Everything else is gone, everything else that distracts from that shouldn’t be happening.”\n\nOn Monday, troops armed with M4 assault rifles were seen guarding Hegseth’s plane at Joint Base Andrews. The security posture stood in stark contrast to the agents and service members who typically greeted Austin at the Maryland base, who were usually armed only with concealed handguns.\n\nWhile unusual, a spokesperson for Air Combat Command said the posture “aligns with standing orders for personnel, especially when operating in official capacities such as deployments or movements during missions.”\n\nIn this still from video, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks to the press on March 26. Pool\n\nAt the southern border, thousands of troops surged there by Hegseth in recent months have primarily been building barricades, putting up concertina wire, and generally “just standing around,” another defense official told CNN.\n\nHegseth also earlier this month ordered the deployment of two heavily armed warships to patrol the waters near the border, where they will primarily be supporting Coast Guard operations to interdict drugs. One of the warships’ most recent deployments was to the Red Sea, where it was tasked with intercepting Houthi missiles and drones.\n\nThe deployments to the border are “clearly more about optics,” the defense official said. The official added that diverting troops and assets to patrol a mostly peaceful border was actually drawing them away from training exercises that could improve overall combat readiness.\n\nAs for the Signal chat, Hegseth has insisted that nothing classified was shared over text, but four people familiar with the matter told CNN that the information Hegseth disclosed on the Houthi group chat was classified, despite the administration’s claims to the contrary. One of the people said they saw documents sent within DoD about the operation, which were marked classified and included the same information Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat about specific weapons platforms and timing.\n\n“It was classified when it was shared below the principal level,” this person said.\n\nHegseth could have declassified the information himself, but he has not said that he did. It’s also unclear why information about an imminent or ongoing operation would be declassified before it was successfully completed.\n\nThe White House, for now, is standing by Hegseth in the wake of the Signal chat scandal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office of the White House on March 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump said his national security adviser Mike Waltz had taken responsibility for creating the Signal group, but the president seemed unaware of the role Hegseth played in including detailed information about airstrikes in the chat.\n\n“It was Mike, I guess, I don’t know,” Trump said when questioned about which of his team was behind the chat. Earlier, the White House said a team of officials from the National Security Council and White House counsel’s office were looking into the matter, assisted by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nYet while Trump said Waltz had assumed responsibility for the error, he shrugged off any culpability on the part of his defense secretary, who sent a timeline of the planned attack before it was underway.\n\n“How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,” Trump said, sounding surprised a reporter would raise the issue. Earlier, the White House said Trump had looked at Hegseth’s messages that were included in the text chain published by The Atlantic.\n\n“It’s all a witch-hunt,” Trump said.\n\nThe White House on Thursday morning declined to offer an update on its internal investigation into the Signal group chat of top Trump national security officials, calling the episode a “mistake.”\n\n‘This does absolutely nothing to make us stronger’\n\nHegseth, who served as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, was confirmed by a razor-thin margin in January as Democrats and some Republicans pressed him on allegations of sexual misconduct, infidelity and excessive drinking in his past.\n\nIn his first appearance on the world stage as Defense Secretary, Hegseth told NATO in February that Ukrainian membership in the alliance was off the table — a statement that Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly called “a rookie mistake” that took away some of the US’ negotiating leverage in pending ceasefire talks.\n\nHegseth later said he would not be involved in the negotiations over ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nWicker is now formally asking the administration for an inspector general report on the Signal chat, plus a classified briefing from a senior official.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Wednesday called on Hegseth and other top Trump officials to own their mistakes related to Signal group chat revelations so that they are not repeated. “The important thing here is these guys, they made a mistake, they know it. They should own it and fix it so that never happens again,” Thune said.\n\nAsked by CNN if he has confidence in Hegseth, Thune again did not directly answer and pointed to the success of the underlying mission. “The execution of the strike looks like pretty flawless,” he said before again urging the officials to come clean.\n\nBut the strikes have not appeared to deter the Houthis. On Thursday, the Israeli military has said that sirens sounded in several parts of the country Thursday after two missiles were fired from Yemen. The Houthis took responsibility for the attack.\n\nA purge of “diversity” content on Defense Department websites, mandated by Hegseth in a February memo, is being reviewed following outcry over DoD’s hasty removal of historically significant articles and images. A top DoD spokesperson was reassigned over the debacle, and Hegseth’s spokesperson, Sean Parnell, acknowledged last week that mistakes were made. He said DoD is now republishing some of the tens of thousands of pieces of content that were removed.\n\n“Of all the things they could be doing, the places they’re putting their focuses on first are really things that just don’t matter … This was literally a waste of our time,” a defense official told CNN of the content purge. “This does absolutely nothing to make us stronger, more lethal, better prepared.”\n\nDirectives hit legal setbacks\n\nMeanwhile, military deportation flights have slowed to a trickle, because the Department of Homeland Security has not actually needed the large and expensive C-17s to help transport migrants, multiple officials said. Only one military flight per week is taking off on average, holding a handful of migrants.\n\nAnd the US Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba—which Hegseth in January touted as a “perfect place” to hold as many as 30,000 migrants—is nearly empty. A significant portion of the 900 troops surged there last month to handle an influx of deportees could soon be sent home, officials said.\n\nSeveral of Hegseth’s directives—issued at Trump’s behest—have also hit legal setbacks. A federal judge last week indefinitely blocked DoD’s ban on transgender service members, dealing a major defeat to a controversial policy the president resurrected from his first term.\n\nAnother federal judge ordered earlier this month that DoD and other federal agencies reinstate probationary employees who were fired at the direction of the Office of Personnel Management. Defense officials warned superiors at the time that such mass firings could be illegal, CNN reported last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (L), Vice President JD Vance (C) and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth participate in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in the Oval Office of the White House on February 07, 2025 Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nOne of the few directives Hegseth has put in writing, a recent strategic guidance memo overhauling the Pentagon’s priorities, appeared to some defense officials like it was more about messaging than substance, amounting to a written pledge by Hegseth to fulfill several of Trump’s favorite military-related promises.\n\nThe memo, reviewed by CNN, did not have a separate section detailing the threat posted by Russia, for example, but it did include vague directives to ramp up border operations and even develop credible military options related to the Panama Canal.\n\nHegseth ultimately rose to the rank of Major before leaving the National Guard in 2021, and has the least experience of any Senate-confirmed defense secretary in recent history.\n\nHis immediate predecessor Austin, a four-star general, served for 41 years and commanded US Central Command; former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper served as the Secretary of the Army before being confirmed as SecDef; and former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, also a 40-year veteran and four-star general, commanded US Central Command as well before being confirmed as Trump’s first secretary of defense.\n\nThe Signal chat fiasco has further highlighted Hegseth’s greenness when it comes to the established protocols for dealing with a highly classified military operation involving airstrikes on a foreign country, a defense official said.\n\n“This is all indicative of his utter inexperience,” the official said.\n\nCNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Americans haven’t been this worried about rising unemployment since 2009, survey shows",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nAmericans are not only increasingly fearful of higher inflation — with President Donald Trump set to announce a sweeping spate of tariffs in just a few days — but many more are now dreading rising unemployment.\n\nConsumer sentiment tanked 12% this month, the University of Michigan said in its latest survey released Friday. That was a slightly steeper decline than the one reported in a preliminary reading earlier this month. Respondents blamed Trump’s erratic trade war for their jitters, the survey said.\n\n“Consumers continue to worry about the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a release. “Notably, two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest reading since 2009.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump is set to announce duties that match the ones foreign countries impose on the United States, so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he has referred to as “the big one.” Trump this week already escalated his trade war by announcing 25% tariffs on all car imports, taking effect on April 3. So far, Trump has slapped tariffs on metals and doubled duties on China to 20%.\n\nThe Michigan survey’s “expectations” index, which captures respondents’ outlook for the economy, plummeted 18% “and has now lost more than 30% since November 2024,” according to a release. And this time, it wasn’t just Democrats and Independents feeling dour; Republicans also grew gloomier, “expressing worsening expectations since February for their personal finances, business conditions, unemployment, and inflation.”\n\nAmericans’ expectations for inflation in the year ahead climbed to 5% this month, up from 4.3% last month, reaching its highest level since November 2022. Meanwhile inflation expectations in the next 5 to 10 years also surged, rising to 4.1%, which was the highest level since February 1993, when it was also 4.1%.\n\n“It’s natural for people to expect higher prices because we haven’t seen a trade war like this since McKinley,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, told CNN’s Matt Egan.\n\n“Sentiment is soft data. We’re used to soft data being abysmal. It doesn’t usually line up with what they do,” Hogan added. “The ongoing battle between soft and hard data has yet to be resolved.”\n\nA conundrum for the Fed?\n\nSo far, Federal Reserve officials have maintained that long-run inflation expectations mostly remain in check. That could quickly change if expectations continue to trend in the wrong direction. And if consumers’ prediction of rising unemployment bears out, that stands to make the Fed’s job even more complicated.\n\nThe Fed pays close attention to people’s perception prices because they can be self-fulfilling; if people expect inflation to climb and remain elevated in the coming years, then they’ll likely adjust their spending accordingly. Officials have said they’ll recalibrate their plans if it’s clear that expectations have indeed taken a turn for the worse.\n\n“If inflation expectations are threatening to become unanchored or becoming unanchored in the long term, then the balanced approach may not work,” St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said Wednesday at an event in Paducah, Kentucky. That would mean the Fed will “probably lean in to the inflation side” of its so-called dual mandate, which is to promote full employment and stabilize prices.\n\nIn that case, any further rate cuts would be off the table for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut now, there’s also the possibility of the US economy weakening as shoppers curb their spending. When the economy weakens more than expected, pushing up unemployment, the Fed usually responds by lowering borrowing costs. Fresh data out Friday showed that consumer spending rebounded in February, advancing 0.4% for the month, after declining 0.3% in January, though people cut back notably on dining out and hotel stays.\n\nConsumer spending accounts for about 70% of economic output, so if that key economic engine begins to sputter, it wouldn’t bode well for the broader US economy.\n\n“The latest consumer health check revealed consumers are increasingly apprehensive about spending amid sticky inflation trends and pre-emptive inflation anxiety from tariffs, flagging consumer sentiment and rising job insecurity,” Lydia Boussour, senior economist at Ernst & Young, said in commentary issued Friday.",

        "content": "New York CNN —\n\nUS stocks were sharply lower Friday as investors digested souring consumer sentiment and inflation data that showed an uptick in one of the Federal Reserve’s key gauges, underscoring the delicate state of the economy as businesses brace for President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\n\nThe Dow tumbled 750 points, or 1.77%, on Friday. The broader S&P 500 fell 2.1% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.8%.\n\nAll three major indexes were on track to close the week in the red. The S&P 500 is down 5% since this year and on track for its first losing quarter since September 2023.\n\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures index rose 2.5% year-over-year in February, unchanged from January and matching expectations. Yet the core PCE index, which strips out volatile categories like food and energy, ticked up to 2.8% year-over-year from 2.7% in January. That hotter-than-expected rise signals that inflation, while broadly cooling, remains above the Fed’s target of 2%.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer sentiment tanked 12% this month, according to the University of Michigan’s latest survey released Friday.\n\nLululemon (LULU) stock tumbled 15% on Friday after the company flagged concerns about the outlook for consumer spending on a call with investors.\n\n“We also believe the dynamic macro environment has contributed to a more cautious consumer,” said Calvin McDonald, chief executive at Lululemon.\n\nTariff anxiety continues to roil markets\n\nWall Street was also grappling with Trump’s announcement on Wednesday of 25% tariffs on all cars shipped into the US, set to go into effect April 3. Trump also announced tariffs on car parts like engines and transmissions, set to take effect “no later than May 3,” according to the proclamation he signed.\n\n“It’s natural for people to expect higher prices because we haven’t seen a trade war like this since McKinley,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN’s Matt Egan.\n\nInvestors sold off stocks amid renewed anxiety about the impact of auto tariffs on the economy. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and economists expect Trump’s sweeping tariff proposals will cause an increase in consumer prices and drag on economic growth.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.27% as investors snapped up government bonds, highlighting a risk-averse sentiment amid tariff uncertainty.\n\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged 10%. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index ticked into “extreme fear” territory, highlighting renewed anxiety among investors.\n\nThe tariffs on autos are an escalation in a trade war with the US’ biggest trading partners, threatening to roil global markets and disrupt a deeply intertwined supply chain across North America.\n\n“While the economy appears solid, business executives are adopting a cautious stance on new investments, largely due to the Trump administration’s aggressive and unpredictable tariff policy,” said Matt Stephani, president of Cavanal Hill Investment Management, in an email.\n\nTrump’s decision to announce the tariffs on autos ahead of the April 2 deadline when reciprocal tariffs are set to be revealed — a date dubbed “Liberation Day” by the Trump administration — has stoked uncertainty on Wall Street. The early announcement highlights Trump’s commitment to tariffs, testing some investors’ initial hope that they might only be a negotiating tactic.\n\n“We think the proposed tariffs as announced would deliver a big hit to the auto industry, stoking higher costs, higher prices and a sharp decline in US sales,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Thursday.\n\n“[The] question is what these very aggressive automotive tariffs signal for next week’s announcement on both reciprocal and ex-auto sector tariffs,” Marcelli added.\n\nEven if Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are not as “severe as initially feared,” market volatility could pick back up due to the auto tariff announcement, according to Marcelli.\n\n“There is no doubt that just as yesterday’s market session was dominated by worries about tariffs, today’s session and the sessions until April 2 (“Liberation Day”) will also see traders preoccupied with tariffs,” said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie, in a Thursday note.\n\nWall Street’s outlook sours\n\nWall Street’s expectations for US stocks this year is being revised down amid continued announcements about tariffs.\n\nAnalysts at UBS on Friday trimmed their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 6,400 from 6,600.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays this week lowered their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,900 from 6,600. Goldman Sachs earlier this month lowered its year-end target to 6,200 from 6,500.\n\nEd Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, recently lowered his year-end target to 6,400 from 7,000.\n\nMeanwhile, the most actively traded gold futures contract in New York on Friday surged above a record high $3,100. Gold is considered a safe haven amid economic turmoil and a hedge against potential inflation.\n\nGoldman Sachs this week revised its year-end target for gold prices to $3,300, up from $3,100, underscoring how the yellow metal’s rise this year is expected to last amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

There are obviously many, many people coming in with injuries,” he said.\n\nKumar added that he understands the Mandalay hospital is out of power and water. “Their capacity to be able to treat patients would be limited now, which is really sad,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile a seismologist told CNN that the powerful 7.7-magnitude quake that rocked Myanmar is like a “great knife cut into the Earth.”\n\nJames Jackson, from the University of Cambridge in England, said the earthquake was caused by a rupture that lasted for “a full minute,” causing sideways movements on the ground.\n\n“Think of a piece of paper tearing, and it tears at about two kilometers per second,” he said. “It’s moving a fault, which is like a great knife cut in the Earth.”\n\nHe said while Bangkok doesn’t have earthquakes, its tall buildings make the city particularly vulnerable to distant tremors.\n\nFabrice Cotton, a seismologist at the GFZ Center, told CNN that the earthquake was comparable in size to one that struck Turkey in 2023.

Perkins Coie previously went to court and obtained a temporary block on parts of the policy.\n\nJenner & Block — founded in Chicago but with a sizable group of attorneys in Washington working in regulatory law, litigation and congressional investigations — is among several major firms that have brought cases against the Trump administration related to social policy changes and funding from the federal government that may be lost.\n\nIn its lawsuit filed in Washington’s federal court on Friday, the firm said it believes Trump’s executive order against it is unconstitutional and meant to chill the legal work it handles.\n\n“These efforts to single out those who sue the government, to undermine the attorney-client relationship, to deter protected speech adverse to the Administration’s policy agenda, and to punish citizens for their associations are irreconcilable with the Constitution,” lawyers representing the law firm wrote in court papers filed in Washington’s federal district court on Friday.\n\nThe firm said in the lawsuit it would likely lose corporate clients, especially those who are government contractors, if the court doesn’t step in to block the Trump policies.\n\n“Continued refusals by federal officials to meet with Jenner lawyers, or denying Jenner lawyers access to federal agencies and buildings, would be devastating to both Jenner’s legal practice and its clients’ interests,” the firm said in its complaint.\n\nThe firm said one client heard the lawyers from Jenner won’t be allowed at a meeting with the Justice Department in which the firm is meant to represent the client. The client then wouldn’t have legal representation at the meeting or would need to find new lawyers within days.\n\n“Partners at the Firm have spent hundreds of hours, collectively, speaking with clients about the Order and its implications,” the complaint says. Many of the firm’s largest clients, making up 40% of its revenue, the lawsuit noted, are contractors with the federal government.\n\n“Several clients have expressed concerns about government-mandated disclosure of their relationship with the Firm to federal agencies and the impact that may have on the contractor’s own relationships with the federal government,” the lawsuit states.\n\nWilmerHale lawsuit\n\nWilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr, with hundreds of lawyers in DC and a long history in Washington, sued Friday as well.\n\nThe White House order limiting hiring of Wilmer attorneys to the federal government, the firm’s access to federal buildings and possible retaliation against some clients “will inevitably cause extensive, lasting damage to WilmerHale’s current and future business prospects” and its ability to represent clients that choose it, the firm wrote.\n\nThe firm was the professional home of former FBI Director and special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Trump and is now retired.\n\nIts lawsuit was filed by Paul Clement, a former George W. Bush-era solicitor general, making the latest case the first truly bipartisan push from the legal industry to challenge Trump’s political retaliation.\n\n“While most litigation requires discovery to unearth retaliatory motive, the Order makes no secret of its intent to punish WilmerHale for its past and current representations of clients before the Nation’s courts and for its perceived connection to the views that Mr. Mueller expressed as Special Counsel,” Clement’s team wrote in Wilmer’s lawsuit Friday.\n\nWilmer has employed top officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations in addition to Mueller and some of his Russia probe deputies. The firm is known for its behind-the-scenes influence in Washington, though also has a large corporate portfolio.\n\nA judge previously found the policies for Perkins Coie that would limit the law firm’s lawyers from accessing federal building and potentially punish their corporate clients who are also government contractors likely to be unconstitutional. Jenner faces very similar restrictions now, and that judge, Beryl Howell of the DC District Court, is likely to hear Jenner & Block’s emergency complaints as well.\n\nFive Trump executive orders borne out of political retaliation against major law firms in Washington in recent weeks have shaken the legal establishment and could reconfigure the way Washington does business, with many of the law firms targeted having deep ties to federal agencies, clientele from across corporate America, and powerful leaders from both political parties among their ranks.\n\nThe White House issued its executive order against Jenner & Block on Tuesday, and Trump and his aide remarked it was partly because of the firm having previously employed Andrew Weissmann, the Mueller investigation prosecutor-turned-TV commentator.\n\nWhile bar associations have condemned Trump’s actions as a draconian rejection of the rule of law, many firms have hesitated to take a stand publicly, fearing they would become a target.\n\nOne firm, Paul, Weiss, Wharton, Rifkind & Garrison, cut a deal with Trump, and the New York Times reported on Thursday another large New York-based law firm was quietly negotiating preemptively.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nA Connecticut woman accused of imprisoning her stepson for nearly two decades and subjecting him to starvation and relentless abuse pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges including assault, kidnapping and cruelty.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Joseph Schwartz denied the state prosecutor’s request to place Kimberly Sullivan, 56, under house arrest, but has ordered Sullivan to wear an electronic GPS monitoring device while she is released on bail.\n\nSullivan was arrested on March 12 after a 32-year-old man – who told police he had been held captive for over 20 years – last month set fire to the Waterbury, Connecticut, home he shared with Sullivan in what authorities described as a desperate bid for freedom.\n\nThe alleged victim is afraid and living “in fear,” Supervisory Assistant State Attorney Don Therkildsen argued in court on Friday as Sullivan, wearing a black floral outfit, stood next to her attorney.\n\nSullivan’s stepson’s “first question in this fear is, ‘Why is she out walking around when I was locked up in a room for 20 years?’” Therkildsen told the court.\n\nThe judge defended his decision, citing the fact that Sullivan has no permanent residence, has been admitted to a hospital since her arrest for mental health reasons, has no prior criminal record and has not failed to appear in court as reasons why house arrest is not necessary.\n\n“On the other hand, I can see the argument someone could show again, just according to the allegations, someone that can show such an extreme indifference to human life have such a lack of empathy,” Judge Schwartz said. “If that person could commit that type of crime, they’re certainly likely to commit another thing.”\n\n“The allegations are arguably the most troubling that I’ve seen during my tenure as a judge and show really an unthinkable amount of lack of empathy, and I do stress that they are just allegations.”\n\nThe alleged victim told police he intentionally started a fire with a lighter, hand sanitizer, and printer paper in his upstairs room, explaining, “I wanted my freedom.” An arrest warrant, obtained by CNN affiliate WFSB, detailed years of what the man described as “captivity, abuse and starvation.”\n\nWhen police arrived, they found the man severely emaciated, weighing just 70 pounds at 5-foot-9. His hair was matted, his teeth were decaying, and he appeared dirty and disheveled.\n\nTherkildsen had requested Sullivan’s bail conditions to be modified, including adding house arrest, GPS monitoring, and for her passport to be surrendered.\n\nSullivan’s attorney, Ioannis Kaloidis, argued against the proposed conditions and said the only change between Sullivan’s previous court appearances and Friday’s hearing “is a two-week track record of compliance.”\n\nSullivan received a number of threats online and restricting her movement will only cause more safety concerns, according to Kaloidis.\n\n“I understand that the whole world wants to convict Miss Sullivan, and the whole world already has, but this is the only place, the only room in this country, where we have an opportunity to protect her rights,” Kaloidis said. “And as unpopular as that may seem, that’s what’s at issue here, her rights, no one else’s.”\n\nAdditional witnesses have come forward, including a friend of Sullivan’s who said in the 21 years she’s known Sullivan, Sullivan has never spoken of a stepson or allowed in the friend in her home, Therkildsen said on Friday.\n\nSince her arrest, Sullivan has denied the allegations through Kaloidis. Sullivan was released on a $300,000 bond.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nSummary Experts warn extreme wellness challenges can create a cycle of dissatisfaction and perfectionism.\n\nDr. Thomas Curran says some people pursue drastic regimens hoping for transformation after life changes.\n\nDietitian Renee McGregor advises cscrutinizing influencers who may profit from wellness products they promote.\n\nSmall sustainable habits like eating more vegetables offer more health benefits than extreme challenges.\n\nFocus on healthful behaviors rather than chasing perfection or seeking validation through wellness accomplishments.\n\nSign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nYou’re scrolling through your phone when you stumble upon the next viral trend: an influencer claiming that following their incredibly strict diet will help you achieve their jaw-dropping physique. Or you see a fresh-faced runner swearing you can run a marathon without any training — just like they did.\n\nWhether or not you’re actively searching for wellness advice, it’s nearly impossible to avoid hearing about the latest health craze making bold guarantees of transformation.\n\nAs you wonder if these claims hold any truth, you might also question why people often feel motivated to dive into intense challenges — when seemingly simple habits, such as getting enough sleep or eating more vegetables, often feel much harder to tackle.\n\nMany of us are drawn to these extreme challenges because we’re craving radical change, hoping it will help prove something to ourselves or to others, experts say.\n\n“We always see these kinds of challenges as opportunities for growth, particularly if we’re in a phase of our life where we’ve let ourselves go,” said Dr. Thomas Curran, associate professor of psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science and an expert on perfectionism. “Maybe we feel that we need to be healthier, or we just had a breakup or (major) life event.”\n\nWith social media amplifying these movements, it’s easy to see why people are increasingly drawn to the idea of achieving the “perfect” version of themselves. But before jumping into a new wellness challenge, it’s important to take a moment, reflect on your goals, and consider where you’re starting from.\n\nChallenging our perceptions of ‘perfection’\n\nWith health influencers raising the bar for success, the wellness space now often feels like a performative space where people strive to showcase peak physical and mental strength.\n\nWhile seeing others’ achievements can be motivating, it can also be discouraging if your progress doesn’t match theirs.\n\nEach person is chasing the perfect version of themselves — whether it’s a body or a lifestyle — which is dangerous because this is typically an impossible or dangerous version to achieve, Curran said. He added that this type of comparison creates a dangerous cycle in which people constantly feel dissatisfied with their own progress.\n\n“It’s a fantasy in many ways, and once you start chasing after it, you constantly find yourself embroiled in a sense of doubt and deficit,” he said.\n\nCurran also noted that wellness challenges can be particularly damaging for women who struggle with perfectionism, as they tend to be bombarded with impossible beauty standards and societal expectations.\n\nRenee McGregor, a UK-based dietitian who specializes in eating disorders and athlete performance, encourages people to approach wellness trends with curiosity and skepticism. That’s because some influencers and celebrities could be promoting products because there’s a financial benefit for them.\n\n“The thing to ask yourself about the person you’re taking advice from is what do they gain from it?” McGregor said. “If they are going to gain financially, then you know that they (could be willing) to sell you a lie.”\n\nWhether you want to try a new challenge or product that promises amazing results, McGregor suggests doing your research and seeking diverse perspectives, including consulting with doctors when possible.\n\nMindful wellness challenges\n\nIf you’re the type of person who thrives on challenges and pushing your limits, this doesn’t mean you need to shy away from wellness challenges altogether. But before diving in, take a step back and ask yourself if you’re pursuing the challenge for the right reasons, McGregor said.\n\nSome people want to try these challenges because they believe something is missing from their life, and they’re looking to attain “worth” or receive validation, McGregor noted.\n\nA good way to assess your motivation is by considering whether the challenge will benefit your health or if it’s about showcasing your accomplishments on social media or some other reason.\n\nBefore trying any new trend, make sure you have the foundation to handle it and be aware of any potential risks, McGregor said.\n\nFor casual runners, this might mean signing up for a 5K but building your endurance gradually while incorporating other strength training exercises into your routine. For more intense challenges, such as a marathon, McGregor encourages people to consult with professionals or a coach who can monitor your progress and condition along the way.\n\nFocusing on sustainable habits\n\nBoth McGregor and Curran emphasize the importance of fostering sustainable health habits before embarking on more extreme challenges.\n\nRather than chasing the idea of being “healthy,” McGregor suggests focusing on actual healthful behaviors and starting small.\n\nIf you’re a highly sedentary person and want to add more movement to your day, try doing lunges while brushing your teeth or taking short walks throughout your typical routine.\n\nMcGregor suggests other small changes, too, including eating vegetables several times a day, basing meals around whole grains and having a handful of nuts each day.\n\n“These are little changes that allow people to reap the rewards of brain health and physical health instead of drinking five juices a day, which is never going to be the answer to your overall health,” she said.\n\nMost importantly, wellness should be giving people pleasure, not about reaching a certain number on the scale or looking a certain way to achieve ultimate happiness, McGregor said.\n\n“There’s a lot we can do with our psychological health, and I think (we) need to realize that comparison never really benefits (us),” McGregor said. “I think sometimes it’s really important for us to be in the (moment) and rest with what’s going on.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "House Republican leaders really didn’t need another controversy surrounding one of their members, but they apparently have one anyway.\n\nIt was last month when Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida first generated national headlines when NBC News reported that the local police department in Washington, D.C., had begun an investigation into the congressman, following a report of an alleged assault. NBC News went on to report soon after that the Metropolitan Police Department in the nation’s capital “sent an arrest warrant” on Mills to interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin’s office, but the warrant went unsigned by the hyper-partisan Trump-appointed prosecutor.\n\nThe GOP congressman issued a statement “vehemently” denying any wrongdoing, claiming that law enforcement “was asked to resolve a private matter” at Mills’ residence. The story soon faded.\n\nUnfortunately for the Florida Republican, however, he’s now confronting an entirely different controversy. Roll Call reported:\n\nIn one of its first actions of the new Congress, the House Ethics Committee announced Thursday it would conduct a further review of allegations against Rep. Cory Mills. It comes after an August 2024 referral from the Office of Congressional Conduct, which found the Florida Republican may have omitted or misrepresented information in financial disclosure reports and kept contracts with the federal government.\n\nWhile congressional ethics are often nuanced and complex, the basic elements of this story are rather straightforward: To avoid conflicts of interest, lawmakers cannot personally benefit from government contracts. Mills, according to investigators, is directly tied to two businesses that did, in fact, receive contracts for munition and weapons for prisons, sparking the controversy.\n\n“There is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Mills may have entered into, held, or enjoyed contracts with federal agencies while he was a Member of Congress,” the Office of Congressional Conduct report concluded.\n\nA Politico report added that the OCC “also found some evidence that Mills may have ‘omitted or misrepresented’ information on his financial disclosure forms.”\n\nThe Republican lawmaker chose not to cooperate with the investigation, though his office issued a statement insisting that Mills is “committed to complying with all laws and ethics rules.” The statement noted that the Federal Election Commission recently dismissed a related complaint, and Mills and his team “trust the House Ethics Committee will come to a similar conclusion.”\n\nMills has reportedly expressed an interest in running for statewide office in the 2026 election cycle. Whether his recent controversies would help or hurt his ambitions is unclear.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The details are still coming into focus, but the publicly available information is clearly alarming. Four U.S. soldiers, who were conducting tactical training, recently went missing while training in Lithuania. The Associated Press reported, “The U.S. Army said the Hercules armored vehicle the four U.S. soldiers were in during a training exercise had been found submerged in a body of water. It said recovery efforts were underway by U.S. Army and Lithuanian Armed Forces and civilian agencies.”\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte initially said the American troops had perished in the incident, though he soon after clarified that the search is ongoing. As if this weren’t serious enough, there’s also the relevance of the location: The exercise was conducted at a training ground roughly 6 miles from the border with Belarus — and Belarus is closely aligned with Vladimir Putin’s Russia.\n\nGiven all of this, it stands to reason that Donald Trump would be up to speed on the details and the status of the search for the American service members. He is, after all, the president and the commander in chief of the armed forces. And yet, HuffPost noted:\n\nDonald Trump appeared unaware on Wednesday that four U.S. soldiers had gone missing during a NATO training exercise in Lithuania. When asked by a reporter if he had been briefed on the situation that began to unfurl hours before, the president replied, “No, I haven’t.”\n\nHe didn’t elaborate. In fact, the president simply moved on to another question.\n\nTo be sure, it’s difficult to know whether Trump was telling the truth. Perhaps he’d been briefed but chose to lie about his knowledge of the incident. But taken at face value, four U.S. troops went missing roughly 6 miles from a Russia-aligned country, and the American president was left totally in the dark about the state of the efforts to find them.\n\nAround the same time, the Republican was also asked about the Signal group chat scandal and whether he believed classified information was shared. “I don’t know,” he replied. “I’m not sure, you have to ask the various people involved.”\n\nThe comments came after the public saw the details of the online chat, which included a message from Trump’s vice president, JD Vance, telling the White House’s national security team that he wasn’t sure “the president is aware how inconsistent” the proposed strike in Yemen was “with his message on Europe.”\n\nThe same text chain featured the White House’s Stephen Miller adding, in apparent reference to the attack plan, “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light.”\n\nThe problems should be obvious: Vance was uncertain about Trump’s knowledge of the relevant details, and one of the president’s right-hand loyalists added an “as I heard it” qualifier to the commander in chief’s directive about a deadly military operation abroad.\n\nTaken together, it’s difficult not to wonder just how out of the loop the president is in his own White House.\n\nFive years ago this month, as the severity of the pandemic came into focus, The New York Times published a memorable analysis that included a word to describe Trump that stood out for me as significant: “bystander.”\n\n“While he presents himself as the nation’s commanding figure, Mr. Trump has essentially become a bystander as school superintendents, sports commissioners, college presidents, governors and business owners across the country take it upon themselves to shut down much of American life without clear guidance from the president,” the Times explained.\n\nA half-decade later, it appears President Bystander has returned. Trump has taken a keen interest in playing golf, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, banning paper straws, watching an enormous amount of television and helping steer the Kennedy Center — but on life-or-death issues, he’s offering the public a lot of shrugged shoulders and blank stares.\n\nFor a president who’s heavily invested in the idea that his immediate predecessor had no idea what was going on around him, Trump’s apparent cluelessness should be a serious problem.",

        "title": "White House targets a law firm that Trump believes ‘rewarded’ Robert Mueller",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "About a month ago, the White House took an unprecedented step, punishing a prominent private law firm because Donald Trump disapproved of its clients. The New York Times described the move as “a breathtaking escalation,” and that description was more than fair.\n\nThe move, however, was simply an opening salvo. A week later, the Republican nevertheless did it again, targeting a different firm. A third firm was punished soon after, followed by a fourth. (Trump also signed an executive order last week that effectively threatened to punish any law firms that, from his perspective, challenge his administration in ways he considers “unreasonable.”)\n\nThe list is still growing. NBC News reported:\n\nTrump signed an executive order today suspending the security clearances for employees at the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP which previously employed Robert Mueller, a special counsel who led the Russia investigation after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe president’s directive accused the firm of, among other things, engaging in “obvious partisan representations.” Just as notably, the White House said in a statement that WilmerHale “rewarded” the former special counsel, whose investigation, in Trump’s estimation, “epitomizes the weaponization of government.”\n\nRight off the bat, it’s important to emphasize just how utterly bonkers these circumstances are. There is no precedent in the American tradition of a White House punishing a private law firm because it hired a lawyer the sitting president does not like. This is not the sort of thing that is supposed to happen in a healthy and free democratic country.\n\nComplicating matters, the idea that Mueller is some kind of super villain is so preposterous that it’s unsettling to see the White House put such a claim in writing. Mueller is, after all, a decorated Marine combat veteran, a lifelong Republican and the former director of the FBI.\n\nYes, he also oversaw an investigation into the Russia scandal, but (a) the scandal was real and serious, even if Trump pretends otherwise; (b) Mueller did nothing wrong before, during or after the probe; (c) serving as a special counsel does not mean a lawyer should be blacklisted for life; (d) Mueller was appointed by the Trump administration, which makes it hilarious to see Trump characterize his work as an example of “weaponization”; and (e) the president has spent the last several years claiming that Mueller cleared him of any wrongdoing in the scandal.\n\nTo be sure, Trump has obviously lied repeatedly about Mueller’s findings, but taken at face value, the president has told the public that the former special counsel “exonerated” him in the Russia scandal.\n\nIf that’s the case, why punish the firm that employed him?\n\nAs for the larger context, not every major law firm is responding to the White House’s offensive the same way. One has already caved, and another appears prepared to caved preemptively to avoid a presidential attack.\n\nThat said, one of the targeted firms is challenging a Trump order in court, and just hours ago, two more firms filed separate lawsuits seeking to block enforcement of the president’s directive.\n\nTrump boasted publicly earlier this week about law firms caving to his demands and giving the White House what it wants, but as things stand, not every firm is bending the knee.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As this week got underway, the public learned about an executive order from Donald Trump that targeted a series of government agencies to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.” Included on the list was the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an independent agency described by The New York Times as “the federal government’s main source of support for the nation’s libraries, museums and archives.”\n\nAs the week neared its end, one specific museum — by some measures, the nation’s most famous — was apparently on the president’s mind. NBC News reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday taking aim at the Smithsonian and its museums, education and research centers. Trump directed Vice President JD Vance to eliminate ‘improper, divisive, or anti-American’ ideology from programs at the Smithsonian Institution, which receives federal funding.\n\nThe same order accused the Biden administration of, among other things, using the Smithsonian to advance what the Republican president described as a “corrosive” ideology.\n\nHow does the White House define words such as “improper,” “divisive,” “anti-American” and “corrosive” in an ideological context? The order didn’t say. Presumably, Trump knows it when he sees it.\n\nHe went on to characterize the Smithsonian as an institution that was “once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement” — before it fell victim to a nefarious ideology that Trump considers “divisive.”\n\nAs part of the same directive, Vance — a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents — will be responsible for identifying and appointing Smithsonian board members who will commit to “advancing the celebration of America’s extraordinary heritage and progress.”\n\nIt was around this time two years ago when The Washington Post reported that the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery accepted a $650,000 contribution from the Republican’s Save America PAC to fund the official portraits of Donald and Melania Trump.\n\nIf the institution hoped that the arrangement might generate some goodwill, those hopes have apparently been dashed.\n\nAs part of the new executive order, the president also directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to overhaul federal parks and monuments that perpetuate a version of history that the White House considers “false.”\n\nWho’ll decide which historical claims are deemed accurate? The order didn’t say that, either, though it’s difficult to be optimistic.\n\nIt comes on the heels of Trump’s recent takeover of the Kennedy Center, part of which included his desire to see the arts institution put on productions in line with his cultural vision.\n\nPerhaps the president can expedite matters by creating some kind committee to examine content he considers un-American?\n\nThe title on the White House’s order said the directive is intended to restore “sanity to American history.” Given the circumstances, “sanity” is not the word that comes to mind.",

Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services put out a proposed rule that would change a wide range of policies under the ACA — including shortening the open enrollment period by a full month, ending eligibility for ACA plans for DACA recipients and no longer requiring gender-affirming care coverage as an essential health benefit on all ACA individual and small group plans.\n\n“This means that insurance plans would no longer be required to cover treatments related to gender transition, such as hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgeries,” Matthew Rose, senior public policy advocate at the Human Rights Campaign, told me in a statement. “As a result, many insurers may drop coverage for these services or shift the costs to individuals and states. If a state mandates coverage for gender-affirming care outside of the federal EHB requirements, it would have to pay for the coverage itself. This could make gender-affirming care more expensive or inaccessible for transgender individuals, particularly those with lower incomes.”\n\nIf this rule, which is open for public comment, gets implemented, I could lose coverage for vital hormone prescriptions and doctor’s appointments.\n\nI’m not alone in worrying about this. According to available data, trans people are more likely to be uninsured than the average cisgender person, and though numbers are hard to come by, trans people appear much more likely to get insurance from a government-subsidized program like the ACA or Medicaid.\n\nHHS estimates that more than 45 million people have ACA plan insurance. If you use the conservative estimate that 0.6% of the population is trans, rough math says that as many as 270,000 people could lose access to the gender-affirming care coverage that they’re currently paying for. The rule, if put into place, would go into effect starting next year, depending on the outcome of likely inevitable lawsuits.\n\nThe proposed rule change has gotten surprisingly little media attention so far, with few outlets reporting on it. The administration’s quiet rollout has seemingly worked, as the rule had received only about 5,400 public comments as of Tuesday morning.\n\nNevertheless, a ban of this nature on gender-affirming care would be unprecedented. This type of care has been consistently covered since 2016, including through the entirety of President Donald Trump’s first term.\n\nAnd this proposed rule, more so than the passport nonsense outlined in the administration’s early executive orders, represents the most alarming government attack on my personal life since Trump took back the White House.\n\nConservatives have a track record of trying to cut funding for things they don’t like by claiming “my tax dollars shouldn’t fund that” — think, “my tax dollars shouldn’t fund abortions.” Now they’re doing the same thing here, claiming they should have personal veto power over tax dollars spent on trans people they have increasingly villainized in recent years.\n\nBut the conservative argument doesn’t work here, for several reasons. In my case, I don’t receive government subsidies for my ACA plan, meaning I pay the entire $500 premium every month myself, with my own money, out of my own pocket. Your tax dollars aren’t going toward my health insurance; it’s just that the government set up the marketplace I buy my plan on.\n\nThis is like buying a car and then eight years later having the owner of the car dealership show up on your doorstep to tell you that you can’t drive it in Vermont anymore.\n\nit’s weird that we have afforded conservatives special rights to divest taxpayer dollars from whichever policy they find offensive.\n\nThe second reason this argument doesn’t work is that no one else is given such deference in politics. When George W. Bush was in office, I couldn’t, as a liberal, stop the government from using my tax dollars to fund wars I opposed. I couldn’t stop the government from using my tax dollars to pay for the expansion of the surveillance state. Right now, I can’t demand that my tax dollars not enable whatever the heck DOGE is doing. (And all of these examples dwarf the amount of money the U.S. spends on abortions or transition care.)\n\nThat’s not how politics works. And it’s weird that we have afforded conservatives special rights to divest taxpayer dollars from whichever policy they find offensive.\n\nWhen I made the jump to working for myself, someone else was able to take my position at the bank, helping to lower the unemployment rate. If my essential health care gets ripped away from the public marketplace, I’ll be forced to again compete for a job that someone else probably needs more than I do, simply so I can get the appropriate health care.\n\nRegardless of the politics of the moment, we shouldn’t be discouraging folks like the 2017 version of myself. I took a leap of faith, backed by a belief in my own abilities and confidence in a government-run insurance marketplace. If you agree, feel free to leave a public comment letting Trump know that this rule shouldn’t go through.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered Trump administration officials to preserve communications from the messaging application Signal that featured in the recent scandal stemming from officials’ discussing military operations in a group chat that included a journalist who wasn’t supposed to be there.\n\nAfter a hearing Thursday, the judge issued an order stating that government defendants “shall promptly make best efforts to preserve all Signal communications from March 11-15, 2025.” It further said the defendants need to file a status report by Monday detailing the steps they’ve taken to preserve those messages.\n\nWatchdog group American Oversight sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials following the publication on Monday of a shocking report about the chat. The communications occurred over Signal, which can be set up to delete messages automatically.\n\nAmerican Oversight’s lawsuit seeks to “prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records and to compel Defendants to fulfill their legal obligations to preserve and recover federal records created through unauthorized use of Signal for sensitive national security decision-making,” according to the group’s legal complaint filed Tuesday.\n\nThe group moved for a temporary restraining order, asking Boasberg to order Hegseth, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately desist from unlawfully destroying federal records in violation of the Federal Records Act.”\n\nMore specifically, the group asked Boasberg to order that officials:\n\n(a) take steps to ensure the preservation of any federal records that were created between March 11 and March 15, 2025, regarding and including any messages that are or were contained in “the Signal chat,” as referenced in the Complaint ... ; (b) ... initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of any destroyed federal records that were created between March 11 and March 15, 2025, regarding and including any messages that are or were contained in “the Signal chat,” as referenced in the Complaint ... and (c) take steps to confirm that the use of any electronic messaging applications with an auto-delete function by any Defendant individually or within their respective agencies, including Signal, complies with all requirements of the Federal Records Act ... and the related rules and regulations of their respective agencies.\n\nAhead of Thursday’s hearing, the government defendants argued in a memo that the group’s claim that officials failed to take measures to prevent the destruction of Signal messages “is not reviewable.” They also argued that a restraining order is unnecessary “because the Defendant agencies are already taking steps to locate and preserve the Signal chat at issue, and at least one agency has already located, preserved, and copied into a federal record keeping system a partial version of the chat.”\n\nBefore being assigned to preside over this case, Boasberg was already handling another high-profile national security-related matter, over the administration’s deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. Boasberg, the chief federal trial judge in Washington, D.C., issued temporary restraining orders in that case and raised questions about whether officials had violated his orders. Litigation in that case is continuing after a divided federal appeals court panel declined to upend Boasberg’s restraining orders.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for Boasberg’s impeachment after he ruled against the administration in the deportation litigation, which led Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare public statement stressing that the proper response to an adverse ruling is an appeal, not an impeachment.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "On MLB Opening Day, here’s how to stop price gouging at the ballpark",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Today, alongside nearly a million fellow sports fans, I’ll make my way to the ballpark to watch the first game of the 2025 Major League Baseball season. As a former college baseball player and diehard Washington Nationals fan, I’ll take in a game at Nationals Park, which cost almost $700 million when it was built nearly 20 years ago. That tab was paid almost entirely by D.C. taxpayers, even though the Nats’ majority owners, the Lerner family, are real estate magnates worth an estimated $6.4 billion. Before sitting down to watch first pitch, I’ll pick up a hot dog, a bag of Cracker Jack and a cold beer. This year, that will set me back a staggering $29.\n\nBaseball, like other major professional sports, is big business. MLB brought in $12.1 billion in revenue last year, thanks in no small part to the attendance of more than 70 million fans. The top five professional sports leagues in North America brought in more than $50 billion combined in 2024. While team valuations, player salaries and owners’ net worths climb higher, it has become increasingly unaffordable for an average American family to catch a game. A family of four can expect to spend an average of $240 for tickets, concessions and parking at a Major League Baseball game. An NFL game will set them back a whopping $631. Though most teams collect only a small percentage of overall revenue from concessions, prices continue to rise, reaching levels double or triple what you would find just across the street at a grocery store or a restaurant.\n\nNearly 80% of airports, which are also heavily funded by taxpayers, are covered by some form of “street pricing plus.”\n\nThe good news is: There’s a way to rein in this price gouging at the concession stand. While there may not yet be a policy solution for getting my Nationals back to the playoffs, we can stop publicly funded venues from ripping off families, who are often barred from bringing their own food and drink in for an affordable snack.\n\nThese days, sports stadiums are nearly always backed by taxpayer funding at the local, state and federal levels, meaning fans are footing the bills on both ends. These funding deals are sold with promises of economic development and community benefits that too often fail to materialize. Even the vendors are big businesses of their own. The Nationals exclusively contract with the concessionaire Levy Restaurants, whose parent company made nearly $3 billion in profits last year.\n\nState, local and federal policymakers should institute what’s called “street pricing” for venues that are funded by taxpayer dollars, as my team at Groundwork Collaborative outlines in a new policy brief. This means that vendors can only charge prices of comparable items outside the stadium at restaurants or convenience stores. Nearly 80% of airports, which are also heavily funded by taxpayers, are covered by some form of “street pricing plus.”\n\nStadiums and arenas are often financed by Private Activity Bonds, which are federally tax-deductible. As a condition of tax exemption, venues financed by Private Activity Bonds should institute strict street pricing policies. State and local policymakers should require street pricing policies as part of negotiated economic development deals for new stadiums and other venues.\n\nAs LaGuardia Airport’s infamous $9.99 Chex Mix proves, though, these policies are often stretched to the point of incredulity and rarely enforced. With that in mind, then, lawmakers should be sure street pricing requirements include rigorous enforcement. And while we’re at it, the Federal Aviation Administration likewise should condition airport funding on stronger street pricing policies and enforcement.\n\nIn return for massive public subsidies, the least billionaire sports owners can do is offer their loyal fans affordable concessions.\n\nStreet pricing requirements would not just be pro-consumer; they would be pro-business. In acknowledgment of fan outrage at high prices, some teams have voluntarily instituted caps on concession prices or special offers. At every Tuesday home game, my Nationals offer $5 concessions, as well as discounted tickets and parking. When Mercedes-Benz Stadium opened in 2017, the Atlanta Falcons instituted a fan-friendly pricing model, slashing concession prices by 50% compared with those in their previous stadium, offering $2 hot dogs and $5 beers. The discount paid off — transactions, revenues and merchandise sales are up, and its fan experience tops the NFL. Portland International Airport has had strict street pricing since the 1980s and enjoys retail sales well above the national average.\n\nAs families are squeezed by rising costs for everything from groceries to housing to utilities and giant corporations institute even more elaborate strategies and fees to squeeze every last penny from consumers, an affordable game at the ballpark is the least they can ask for. In return for massive public subsidies, the least billionaire sports owners can do is offer their loyal fans affordable concessions.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump defended his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, the creator of the infamous Signal group chat in which administration officials reportedly planned major military strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. Trump said Waltz had “learned a lesson” after the national security adviser added Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the group — about as close as it seems the president will come to acknowledging the egregious act of discussing a U.S. military operation on a commercial chat app.\n\nWhile Waltz has rightfully come under fire for starting the chat and adding Goldberg, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deserves the most scrutiny.\n\nToday, the full extent of Hegseth’s texts in the Signal thread at 11:44 a.m. March 15 were revealed. It was Hegseth who posted a “TEAM UPDATE” that contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen.\n\nIt was Hegseth who put the precise timing and sequencing of the entire operation into an unclassified text app.\n\nIt was Hegseth who revealed the aircraft that would be used to conduct the strikes before the operation took place.\n\nIt was Hegseth who moved classified information to a commercial text app that could have been intercepted by our adversaries.\n\nAnd it was Hegseth who put our brave service members, including the fighter pilots preparing to conduct the operation, in mortal danger.\n\nThe Atlantic’s reporting is full of shocking revelations about how the entire national security apparatus and some of the most powerful people in the world apparently make military decisions as casually as a group of friends planning a dinner.\n\nBy typing this information into a Signal chat, Hegseth created the possibility that an adversary could see what the U.S. military was planning to do, who was being targeted and when it was going to happen. Even an encrypted app like Signal is not immune from hackers. Just days before this security breach, a Pentagonwide advisory warned that “a vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application” and that “Russian professional hacking groups” were looking to exploit it.\n\nThere is not a military operation in modern American history whose planning isn’t classified.\n\nThough the White House and top intelligence officials have denied that any classified information was shared on the chat, there is not a military operation in modern American history whose planning isn’t classified. What’s more, classified systems are physically separate from unclassified ones — different email addresses, different servers, no ability to copy and paste information from one to the other. That means Hegseth had to open his classified email or binder, and manually type the military strike details into Signal.\n\nDetails of operations falling into the wrong hands give adversaries the ability to wreak havoc on the operation — or worse, retaliate against our troops. Imagine if a hacking group linked to Iran was able to penetrate the Signal chat. It’s not hard to picture an adversarial group selling the content of Hegseth’s 11:44 a.m. text to the Houthis or their backers in Iran, who have previously helped the Houthis shoot down unmanned U.S. aircraft. Armed with head start knowledge of where U.S. planes were flying and when, the Houthis could have targeted U.S. military fighter jets and ships participating in the strike — possibly leading to catastrophic consequences.\n\nDue to the incredible ineptitude of Hegseth and the individuals on the Signal thread by somehow unknowingly inviting a reporter into their group chat, how can our allies and partners trust the United States with sensitive and classified information? Who is to say there aren’t more of these chats?\n\nPreventing those sorts of outcomes is why discussions of operations are held in classified rooms, where the commander overseeing the strike — in this case, the commander of U.S. Central Command — presents the plan to those authorized to be there. When I worked as a Pentagon spokesperson, we would not even confirm an operation took place unless we knew the operation had concluded and our pilots were safe. It’s this level of security and caution that protect our troops who put their lives on the line for their country.\n\nHegseth bragged about restoring meritocracy and competence to the Pentagon. In less than 100 days, he has done the opposite. It is time for Congress to investigate why the defense secretary of the world’s most powerful military risked the lives of our U.S. service members, all for the convenience of a group chat.",

        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 26 episode of “The Rachel Maddow Show.”\n\nTypically, in March of an odd-numbered year, we don’t get a lot of big election news. However, that isn’t the case this year. On Tuesday, we got two major results out of two elections in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania state House, Democrats won a special election that will hand them control of that legislative chamber. The win wasn’t much of a surprise since it was considered a Democratic-leaning district. In November, Kamala Harris won it by 16 points. That said, there was still a bit of good news for Democrats, because even though Harris won that district by 16 points, on Tuesday the Democratic candidate, Dan Goughnour, did even better — he won by nearly 30 points. That’s a huge margin, and reason alone for Pennsylvania Democrats to celebrate.\n\nRepublicans are reportedly growing concerned after the Democratic candidate out-fundraised the GOP candidate by more than 10-to-1.\n\nBut there was also another election in the state, this one for a seat in the Pennsylvania state Senate. The seat had previously been held by a Republican and it was seen as a really red district. In November, Donald Trump won it by 15 points. But Tuesday, James Malone, a Democrat, managed to flip the seat.\n\nThis is turning into a theme for Democrats. This year already, the party scored a huge upset win in Iowa. There, Democrat Mike Zimmer won a state Senate election in a district Trump carried by 21 points in November. And earlier this month, Democrats in Minnesota won a contest for a state House seat, electing Doron Clark. In that case, that district was heavily Democratic and the party expected to win there — but I don’t think they expected to win by a whopping 70 points.\n\nAll of this good news for Democrats comes as we are awaiting three very big special elections next week. In Wisconsin, there is a race that will determine control of the state’s Supreme Court — and, by extension, the future of abortion rights and voting rights in that state.\n\nIt’s technically a nonpartisan race but Elon Musk’s super PAC has poured more than $10 million into supporting the candidate favored by Republicans. Musk’s PAC is also offering voters $100 if they sign a petition against activist judges, thereby helping identify people for the party’s “get out the vote” efforts.\n\nThanks to Musk, Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race is now the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history.\n\nThere are also two special elections in Florida next week, one race to fill the congressional seat vacated by Trump’s national security adviser and group chat enthusiast, Mike Waltz, and another race to fill the seat vacated by the president’s first pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz. (The one who had to withdraw his name following lack of GOP support in light of previous allegations of illicit drug use and sex with a minor — all of which Gaetz denies.)\n\nThose are both considered heavily Republican districts. But in Waltz’s old district, Republicans are reportedly growing concerned after the Democratic candidate out-fundraised the GOP candidate by more than 10-to-1, which means that even though this is a very Republican district, Democrats are clearly putting up a fight.\n\nWatch this space.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As he sized up a U.S. plan to strike Houthi militants in Yemen in March, Vice President JD Vance didn’t think such an aggressive move was a good idea — at least not now. The vice president’s initial comment in the Signal chat that has gotten so much attention this week was that such a strike would be “a mistake.”\n\nAmong other things, he didn’t think the American public would understand why we were doing it and worried that it might cause oil prices to spike. In that message, he wrote:\n\n3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth responded by arguing that the strike wouldn’t even be about the militants the U.S. sought to kill. Instead, it was about signaling American power to the world.\n\nThough most of the commentary about the Signal group chat this past week has focused on the accidental inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg — an outrageous breach of national security protocols — the scandal has also provided us an extraordinary window into Trump’s inner circle’s thinking about foreign policy strategy.\n\nIt underscores how farcical Trump's pledge to be president of \"peace\" and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be.\n\nWhat it reveals is a cavalier attitude toward new open-ended bombardment campaigns. And it underscores how farcical Trump’s pledge to be president of “peace” and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be. Trump didn’t need to drop bombs on scores of sites across the poorest country in the Middle East now or with such intensity — and his whole team admitted it.\n\nVance was not wholly opposed to the strikes, but saw them as a deviation from a narrow focus on American interests. In some ways, he seemed to be holding the strictest interpretation of “America First\" principles in the chat. His thinking was why attack Houthi militants if doing so wasn’t that important for the U.S. economically, but could hurt U.S. consumers and politically hurt Trump?\n\nMultiple principals in the chat pushed Vance to adopt an expansive vision of U.S. national interests.\n\nHegseth argued, “This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause.” And national security adviser Michael Waltz contended: “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.”\n\nIn a later exchange Vance says he defers to the group but that he hates the idea of “bailing Europe out again.” Hegseth replies, “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.”\n\nIn the discussion, Hegseth and Waltz represent a more traditional view of America as the world’s police officer. They’re saying this isn’t about defending the U.S. against the militants who are being targeted, and it isn’t about the U.S.’s own economic interests. Rather, it’s an intervention on behalf of U.S. allies and a pre-emptive signal to the U.S.’s nemesis in the region, Iran. It functions as a way “to send a message” about American geopolitical supremacy. It is the kind of argument that could easily be advanced by a Democratic liberal internationalist or a Republican neoconservative — both factions that some MAGA types have correctly lambasted as war hungry.\n\nWeeks after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel began its retaliation, Houthi rebels began launching missiles and drone attacks at Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, citing Israel's bombing of Gaza and stating it wouldn't stop until “Israeli aggression stops.\" The Biden administration launched airstrikes against the Houthis in 2024, but that did not stop them. Rather, the Houthis announced a pause when Israel and Hamas struck a ceasefire deal. (In the meantime, many shipping companies have taken up routes avoiding the Red Sea, and after an initial rise in the price of shipping, those companies adapted and prices came down again this year.) Now, in light of Israel’s decision to torpedo the ceasefire deal and impose a starvation blockade on the entire population of Gaza — with Trump's blessing — the Houthis had warned that they would resume missile attacks. But they hadn’t yet. Multiple Pentagon officials told Military.com that the Houthis last launched an attack in December. In other words, Trump approved a pre-emptive strike, not a protective one; as Hegseth put it, the U.S. got to \"start this on our own terms.\" The U.S. has been carrying out such attacks on a daily basis since March 15 and released few details about them, and it’s unclear when they’ll stop.\n\nThese attacks have serious consequences for the civilian population of Yemen. Yemeni officials say the strikes have hit residential areas. Indeed, in the chat discussion in the aftermath of the strikes, Waltz appears to admit that the U.S. targeted civilian infrastructure. “The first target — their top missile guy — we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed,” Waltz wrote on Signal.\n\n“Excellent,” Vance replied.\n\nThe Yemen Data Project, an independent nonprofit that monitors attacks in the country, reports that it “recorded 53 civilian casualties in 38 U.S.-led strikes from 15 to 21 March.” And according to Military.com, citing two defense officials, the Trump administration is striking a broader range of targets than President Joe Biden did and harbors “less reluctance to hold off striking targets based on the casualties that may result.” All this is all happening in a war-torn, destitute country where most of the population is food insecure.\n\nThere's reason to be doubtful that these attacks will deter the Houthis. “The group withstood seven years of Saudi-led airstrikes and a year of U.S. strikes under the Biden administration, which yielded little effect,” Luca Nevola, a senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a crisis monitoring group, told The New York Times. Given that resilience, there’s not a lot of reason to believe that Trump’s apparently open-ended campaign will in fact make a huge dent using air power alone.\n\nAmerica First, as we’re coming to see in Trump’s second term, is not fundamentally about reducing conflict in the world; nor does it reflect a serious commitment to restraint. Since news of the Signal chat broke, Democrats and liberal commentators have slammed Trump’s national security team for discussing military plans on a chat that included a journalist. They’ve laughed at the misspelling of “principals” in the group chat, and derided those officials’ hokey use of prayer emojis in anticipation of the strikes. Granted, it was an idiotic and concerning lapse in security protocol. However an important part of the story isn’t just the lapse itself, but what it teaches us about how Trump’s inner circle sees the United States’ role in the world, and how that vision is contiguous with that of previous stewards of American empire. That this seems to have largely gone unnoticed speaks to how numb Americans have become to dropping bombs in the Middle East.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s first personnel failure was the collapse of former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s attorney general nomination. That was soon followed by Chad Chronister’s failed nomination to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration and former Rep. Dave Weldon’s failed nomination to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe list is still growing — and the latest addition to the list is arguably the most dramatic. The president announced by way of his social media platform that Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York is no longer his choice to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations:\n\nAs we advance our America First Agenda, it is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress. ... With a very tight Majority, I don’t want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise’s seat. The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations. Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People.\n\nUnlike some of Trump’s other failed nominees, there was never any real doubt that Stefanik would be confirmed, probably on a bipartisan basis. Her nomination nevertheless languished as Senate Republicans scrambled to quickly approve other White House picks, for one simple reason: House GOP leaders, struggling with a tiny majority, didn’t want to lose her vote.\n\nBut with House Republicans likely to pick up two new members in Florida’s congressional special elections next week, the conventional wisdom was that Stefanik’s nomination would soon be back on track.\n\nEvidently, those assumptions were wrong.\n\nTrump’s candor was of interest. He didn’t want to “take a chance” on her congressional seat. In case this isn’t obvious, Stefanik’s congressional district, in the northeastern corner of the Empire State, is generally seen as a Republican stronghold. Indeed, Trump won the district last fall by 21 points.\n\nBut as Democrats prove that they can compete in reliably red districts, GOP officials were apparently afraid of what could happen in a special election in New York.\n\nTrump’s statement added that Stefanik will now “rejoin the House Leadership Team,” which might come as a surprise to Republican Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan, who succeeded Stefanik as the House GOP Conference chair.\n\nAs the dust settles on the news, a couple of other dimensions to the story are worth keeping in mind. The first is that Stefanik worked tirelessly throughout the 2024 election season to help Trump’s ticket, engaged in shameless sycophancy, and she was reportedly even under consideration to be his vice presidential nominee. After Trump prevailed, no one was surprised to see him offer the congresswoman an important reward that would have advanced her career considerably.\n\nAs things stand, however, Stefanik is right back where she was, effectively walking away from the process empty-handed.\n\nFinally, there’s a pattern of note: After Trump won a second term, he tapped three sitting members of the U.S. House for his team: Florida’s Gaetz, Florida’s Mike Waltz and Stefanik.\n\nGaetz’s nomination proved to be a fiasco; Waltz’s tenure as White House national security advisor really isn’t going well; and Stefanik’s U.N. nomination is no more.\n\nWhen drawing up a list of Trump’s second-term failures, don’t forget to include his personnel disasters.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A New York county clerk declined to enforce Texas’ civil judgment against a doctor who prescribed abortion pills to a patient via telehealth, escalating an interstate legal battle that is expected to end up before the Supreme Court.\n\nCiting New York’s shield laws, acting Ulster County Clerk Taylor Bruck informed Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Thursday that he will not file a more than $100,000 judgment against Dr. Margaret Daly Carpenter, a physician who practices in upstate New York. Any similar filings that come his way will also be rejected, Bruck added.\n\n“Since this decision is likely to result in further litigation, I must refrain from discussing specific details about the situation,” Bruck said in a statement.\n\nCarpenter was sued by Paxton’s office in December for prescribing abortion pills via telemedicine to a patient who lives near Dallas. Paxton accused Carpenter of violating Texas law by practicing medicine in the state without a local license. Last month, a Texas judge ordered Carpenter to stop prescribing abortion pills to patients in the state and issued her a more than $100,000 fine.\n\nPaxton, in a statement on X, said that he was “outraged” over the county clerk’s refusal to allow his state to enforce the judgment against Carpenter, whom he called “a radical abortionist illegally peddling dangerous drugs across state lines.” (Ample research has shown that mifepristone and misoprostol, the two pills that induce an abortion, are safe and effective.)\n\nCarpenter is also facing criminal charges in Louisiana for allegedly prescribing abortion pills to a patient in the state. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul last month rejected Louisiana’s request to extradite Carpenter, setting up another potential showdown over New York’s shield laws.\n\nCarpenter did not immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment. She has not made any public statements about either case.\n\nNew York is one of more than a dozen states with legislation to protect patients, health care providers or others who help people access reproductive care in states where it is outlawed. Texas’ case against Carpenter — as well as Louisiana’s — are likely to be scrutinized by federal courts and eventually reach the Supreme Court.",

        "title": "Elise Stefanik just learned the truth about Trump and loyalty",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Rep. Elise Stefanik gave up so much to be Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. She departed her position in the House Republican leadership. She said goodbye to much of her staff and a congressional seat that she surely would hold far longer than an ambassadorial post. She lost friendship after friendship over her unwavering loyalty to the president.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump repaid Stefanik’s loyalty as only he could: by kicking her nomination to the curb — notably, not because of anything she did, but because of his own mistakes.\n\nJoining the MAGA White House was supposed to be the culmination of a political makeover years in the making.\n\nStefanik has completely recast her public persona since 2014, when she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. In 2016, she voted for John Kasich in the Republican primary, skipped that year’s GOP convention and criticized Trump’s language on the “Access Hollywood” tape. Early in Trump’s first term, she opposed his tax cut plan and even backed Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian influence and the 2016 election.\n\nBut after the 2018 midterms, as The New York Times’ Nicholas Confessore wrote, Stefanik “embarked on one of the most brazen political transformations of the Trump era.” Perhaps the Democrats’ first impeachment of Trump “radicalized” her, as multiple aides told The Washington Post’s Ruby Cramer. Perhaps the proceedings were a convenient excuse for an ambitious politician who recognized Trump’s tightening grip on her party.\n\nWhatever the motivation, Stefanik became one of the president’s most loyal soldiers. Nothing Trump said or did was indefensible; every Democrat and media outlet was “vicious” or “radical.” The president noticed: “This young woman from upstate New York — she has become a star,” he gushed to Fox News.\n\nThe old moderate still pokes through occasionally: In late 2022, Stefanik broke with most House Republicans to back the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified protections for same-sex marriage in federal law. But, by and large, Stefanik is “ultra MAGA” and “proud of it.” Joining the MAGA White House was supposed to be the culmination of a political makeover years in the making.\n\nBut in the midst of Stefanik posting a retrospective of her congressional career on Instagram, Trump announced he was withdrawing her nomination. “It is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican seat in Congress,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “With a very tight Majority, I don’t want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise’s seat.”\n\nWhile for Trump there is no quality in a subordinate more important than loyalty, that loyalty runs only one way.\n\nThe president may have bankrupted multiple casinos, but for once he is right about the odds. In the 14 special elections held this year, former FiveThirtyEight editor G. Elliot Morris calculates that Democrats “beat Harris’s margin vs Trump with the same voters last November by 10 percentage points on average.” That swing is almost exactly the same as it was at this point in the 2018 election cycle, which ended with House Republicans being routed in the midterms. Just this week, Pennsylvania Democrats flipped a state Senate district that just five months ago went for Trump by 15 points.\n\nHouse Republicans hold only a 218-213 majority in the chamber, with four empty seats. On paper, those vacancies are evenly split: two heavily Democratic districts and two heavily Republican districts. But the GOP pair, Florida’s 1st and 6th Congressional districts, suddenly look a lot less red ahead of their special elections next week. In the latter district, which Republicans won by 30 percentage points in November, a recent internal GOP poll shows Democrat Josh Weil up 3%. As Trump himself implied in his Truth Social post, plowing ahead with Stefanik’s nomination risked losing her seat as well.\n\nThis fiasco, as is so often the case with Trump, is entirely self-inflicted. Just as in his first term, a disastrous start to his term has boosted Democratic voters’ enthusiasm for even low-turnout special elections. And whereas the Democratic-leaning vacancies came about because the representatives died while in office, Trump himself created the Florida vacancies by choosing those two representatives for his Cabinet. The first was Mike Waltz, now best known for his struggles with Signal. The second was Matt Gaetz, whose nomination as attorney general lasted just eight days.\n\nThe president tried to soften the blow by noting that Stefanik would “rejoin the House Leadership Team.” But Stefanik’s old position as Republican Conference chair was filled weeks ago, and it’s not clear how Speaker Mike Johnson could give her a position that isn’t entirely ceremonial. “I will invite her to return to the leadership table immediately,” Johnson said, without specifying what her seat would be.\n\n“She must be so disappointed,” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said of Stefanik after news broke of the withdrawn nomination. If that’s true, Stefanik isn’t showing it. “I have been proud to be a team player,” she told Fox News. “This is about stepping up as a team.”\n\nBut it is fitting that this most devoted “team player” has so little to show for her fealty. Because, while for Trump, there is no quality in a subordinate more important than loyalty, that loyalty runs only one way. Just ask Mike Pence or John Kelly or the countless other former Trump allies and staffers whom the president has callously thrown under the proverbial bus. For Trump, only his own interests matter. Everyone and everything else, whether it’s Elise Stefanik or the entire country, is expendable.",

        "title": "How Trump’s election executive order would break mail-in voting",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s disdain for mail-in voting has been a thorn in the GOP’s side for years. Since its use surged ahead of the 2020 election, he’s occasionally hedged before returning to the notion that the extremely secure balloting method is a gateway to fraud. In an executive order signed Tuesday, he aims to kneecap mail-in balloting around the country and make the practice as ripe for abuse as he’s claimed.\n\nThe mail-in balloting provisions in Trump’s order hinge on a fringe interpretation of a decades-old federal law establishing a uniform Election Day around the country. There are more than a dozen states that currently count ballots postmarked on or before Election Day, as long as they were received within a certain number of days. Under the reading the White House is promoting, states that count ballots received after Election Day violate the federal law, no matter when those ballots are postmarked. And under Article VI of the Constitution, federal law trumps state laws.\n\nHe aims to kneecap mail-in balloting around the country and make the practice as ripe for abuse as he’s claimed.\n\nThose states and voting rights advocates will argue that those ballots have been cast by the deadline, just haven’t been received to be counted. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled otherwise last year in a case brought by the Mississippi Republican Party and the National Republican Committee. That decision didn’t go into effect before last year’s election and is limited to federal elections, not state and local races. It has also yet to be affirmed by any other court, but the Trump administration is clearly hoping to take it nationwide.\n\nTrump’s order tasks Attorney General Pam Bondi with taking “all necessary action” to enforce the Election Day law against states that count late ballots in the tally for presidential electors and members of Congress. It also orders the Election Assistance Commission to condition the funding it provides states to help run their elections on those states no longer counting ballots received after Election Day. (There is a specific carveout in the latter provision for ballots received from “absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters.”)\n\nThe order completely subverts the principle behind setting a unitary Election Day — ensuring as many people can vote as possible — in the name of defending it.\n\nThe problems are obvious when you consider what’s really being asked of states. States that conduct their elections almost entirely via mail, such as Washington and Oregon, would have to move their current deadlines, which now allow ballots to be mailed up to Election Day. Otherwise, they would be forced to reject ballots that they consider legal. Last year, Oregon counted just more than 13,000 of those ballots appropriately postmarked and received within the seven-day window allowed under state law.\n\nThe order would also require states to rely solely on the U.S. Postal Service in returning mailed ballots. USPS’ timeliness was already a concern in 2020 when recently retired Postmaster General Louis DeJoy was at the helm. The fear then was that DeJoy would in some way stymie the delivery of blank ballots to voters or their return to election officials. Those fears never materialized, but with Trump eyeing privatizing the Post Office or merging it under the Commerce Department, it’s worth considering how an outright politicization of the mail force could affect election results.\n\nThere will most certainly be lawsuits against the order, especially some of its even more intrusive provisions that place burdens on states that Trump has no power to order. On one level, I agree with election expert Rick Hasen, who argued Wednesday that the executive order is a “dangerous power grab” that state officials from both parties should reject. There is a fundamental tension between the attempt to usurp power over elections from the states and the GOP’s professed support for “states’ rights.”\n\nThere is no tension, though, between Trump’s order and previous conservative efforts to limit the number of people who can easily vote. The order acts as a back door to enact harmful proof of citizenship requirements that will likely face a Democratic filibuster if pushed through Congress. It also actively seeks to punish states who refuse to comply with a demand for “information-sharing agreements” with the Justice Department to root out alleged voter fraud (a perennial unfounded GOP concern), which are more likely to be those states with Democratic leaders.\n\nWhen you couple in the Justice Department’s hesitancy to back Voting Rights Act cases, this order will potentially disenfranchise millions of voters from casting their ballots safely. Even outside the worst-case scenario, one in which a Trump-controlled Postal Service withholds ballots in blue states until after the deadline has passed, the pieces are all in place for Trump to totally break mail-in voting. In doing so, the order completely subverts the principle behind setting a unitary Election Day — ensuring as many people can vote as possible — in the name of defending it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The White House, the Republican Party and their MAGA media mouthpieces think the American people are idiots.\n\nThat’s the only explanation for the Trump administration’s ludicrous, insulting, borderline Orwellian response to the revelation that top national security officials were discussing a military strike in Yemen — and revealing what was very likely classified information about it — on the Signal messaging app with the unbeknownst presence of Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic. And it’s the only explanation for Trump’s enablers in Congress and right-wing media going straight into deny-at-all-costs mode.\n\nOver the past four days, the White House’s response to the emerging scandal has followed a familiar playbook — denial, obfuscation, attacks on critics, gaslighting and whataboutism. The sad part is, considering that many of the president’s supporters will believe every word he says, combined with the cowardice of Trump’s GOP congressional allies, it’ll likely work.\n\nThe White House’s response to the emerging scandal has followed a familiar playbook — denial, obfuscation, attacks on critics, gaslighting and whataboutism.\n\nWhen Goldberg first broke the story in The Atlantic on Monday, it sent jaws to the floor across Washington and beyond. The Trump team adopted a familiar strategy — denial. In congressional hearings the next day, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe said no classified material had been discussed on the Signal chat.\n\n“Nobody was texting war plans,” said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, even though Goldberg’s article about the incident showed that Hegseth had done precisely that — and White House officials had already confirmed that his reporting was correct.\n\nHowever, as is often the case with Trump and his acolytes, they quickly shifted gears into attack mode.\n\n“You’re talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes,” Hegseth said of Goldberg. “This is a guy who peddles in garbage.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Katherine Leavitt claimed that the crux of the Signal story was not the White House’s disregard of security safeguards but rather proof that “Democrats and their propagandists in the mainstream media know how to fabricate, orchestrate and disseminate a misinformation campaign quite well. And there’s arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg.”\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz labeled Goldberg a “loser” and speculated, without evidence, that the magazine editor had snuck his way onto the group chat.\n\nOthers in the MAGA-sphere picked up Waltz’s line of attack, with Fox News’ Jesse Watters claiming that journalists like Goldberg, who he called the “lowest of the low”... “sometimes send out fake names with a contact with their cells to deceive politicians.” (In fact, there is no evidence Goldberg did anything like this, which would be an egregious breach of journalistic norms.)\n\nKeep in mind that Waltz directly added Goldberg to the group chat. If Goldberg is as awful as the White House claims, what was he doing in the chat? And if a reporter of allegedly such low character somehow snuck onto the chat, what does that say about Waltz’s decision to initiate a discussion about U.S. war plans on a third-party messaging app?\n\nFaced with the truth, the Trump team switched to its perhaps most favored tactic — gaslighting.\n\nThe drumbeat of attacks on The Atlantic and Goldberg were, in effect, daring the magazine to release the chat logs and prove they were lying … which it did on Wednesday. Those logs showed that Gabbard and Ratcliffe arguably perjured themselves and that Hegseth’s denial that he had texted out war plans was a lie.\n\nNow, faced with the truth, the Trump team switched to its perhaps most favored tactic — gaslighting.\n\nThese weren’t “war plans,” the White House huffily argued … they were “attack plans.” According to Hegseth, since there were “No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information” in his texts, they weren’t “war plans” or even “attack plans.” It was just 18 good friends getting on a group chat and shooting the breeze about a military attack. Nothing to see here.\n\nOnly in the Trump administration’s alternate universe is information about a pending military attack not classified. Moreover, Hegseth didn’t just say an attack was coming — he listed the specific times they’d be occurring and the types of weapons systems that would be used.\n\nThere is no world in which such operational plans — if they became available before an attack — wouldn’t be helpful to the enemy and potentially put U.S. fighter pilots in harm’s way.\n\nImagine, for example, if on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, U.S. intelligence officials intercepted a Japanese cable that said their planes were bombing targets in Hawaii in two hours. Would U.S. officials ignore it because, as Hegseth claims, no locations, routes, or units were identified?\n\nAnd yet, Republicans are still trying to defend this mess. According to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, “The messages The Atlantic released only prove that America is STRONG again. President Trump’s national security leaders are patriots who collaborate and then act decisively to take out terrorists. A welcomed, needed change after four years of weakness from President Biden.”\n\nNever mind that Biden, as president, ordered multiple attacks on the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nNo matter what Donald Trump does, no matter how badly his minions screw up, his supporters will always come around.\n\nThen, when all else fails, there is always the GOP’s favorite strategy — whataboutism. Asked on Thursday about whether there would be an FBI investigation of the release of classified material in the Signal scandal, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, “If you want to talk about classified information, talk about what was at Hillary Clinton’s home that she was trying to BleachBit.”\n\nOklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin took a similar tack, arguing that Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server was far worse than anything on the Signal chat. Unless Mullin has previously unknown evidence that Clinton leaked military attack plans hours before the attack commenced, this is not remotely true.\n\nOthers tried to divert calls for accountability for those involved in the unclassified group chat by pointing to the supposed lack of accountability for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during the Biden administration.\n\nChildren are frequently reminded that two wrongs don’t make a right. Apparently, that lesson has failed to penetrate the upper echelons of the Trump administration, the Republican Party, or its slavish media cheerleaders.\n\nThe sad part of all this lying, distraction and gaslighting is that it will almost certainly work.\n\nA poll today from YouGov showed that 60% of Republicans viewed the scandal as a very or somewhat serious problem, with 28% saying it’s a “very serious” problem and 16% said they weren’t sure. It’s rare these days to see that kind of disapproval of the Trump administration from Republicans, but, give it a week, and those numbers will likely come crashing back to Earth.\n\nIf there is one consistent political reality in the last 10 years, it is that no matter what Donald Trump does, no matter how badly his minions screw up, his supporters will always come around. Try to steal an election, incite an insurrection, get convicted of 34 felonies, screw up the handling of a global pandemic, share classified information on an insecure unclassified messaging app … all is eventually forgiven.\n\nAfter all, how can anyone get angry with Donald Trump? In their thinking, whatever he might have done, Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or Joe Biden almost certainly did something worse.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 26 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”\n\nWhile there is a lot of focus on the major scandals involving Donald Trump’s administration, it’s important we don’t lose sight of what’s happening inside this country, where we are witnessing the federal government snatch people right off the streets for their political speech. The latest, most chilling example of that happened Tuesday outside of Boston, when Rumeysa Ozturk, a Ph.D. student and Fulbright scholar at Tufts University, was taken off a residential street in Somerville, Massachusetts.\n\nThe masked ICE agents then lead the terrified woman to their unmarked vehicles and drive off.\n\nAt 5:15 p.m., Ozturk, who came to the United States from Turkey on a student visa, had just left her apartment when, as video obtained by NBC News shows, she was approached by a man in a dark hoodie and hat who grabbed her hands. In that video, you can see and hear how upset and scared she is. Eventually, an ICE agent finally pulls out a badge and appears to identify himself as law enforcement.\n\nOzturk is quickly surrounded by half a dozen cops, all in street clothes with their faces covered by masks. They take her cellphone and physically remove her backpack. She is then handcuffed as a bystander films and asks how anyone is supposed to know these people are law enforcement officials. The ICE agents then lead the terrified woman to their unmarked vehicles and drive off.\n\nNow, if all that were not chilling enough, an attorney for Ozturk released a statement earlier Wednesday saying in part: “We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. … No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of.”\n\nTuesday night, a district court judge ordered Ozturk not be moved out of Massachusetts “without first providing advance notice.” But late the next afternoon, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee locator, Ozturk is currently being held in a south Louisiana ICE processing center, nearly 2,000 miles from where she was snatched off the street.\n\nIn response to Ozturk’s detention, more than 1,000 people showed up in Somerville on Wednesday night to protest and call for her return.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that “investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas.” But she is still not charged with any crime. The “activities” she is accused of appear to be that she co-wrote an editorial in the Tufts University newspaper that was published a year ago.\n\nThe piece reads, in part, “We … affirm the equal dignity and humanity of all people,” specifically referencing Palestinians. It then goes on to quote the author James Baldwin and challenges the university’s president to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “embrace efforts by students to evaluate ‘diverse and sometimes contradictory ideas and opinions.’”\n\nIn response to Ozturk’s detention, more than 1,000 people showed up in Somerville on Wednesday night to protest and call for her return.\n\nOzturk is not charged with a crime because, as far as we know, she did not commit one. She is here legally on a visa. And while the government does have the discretion to terminate a visa, is this how America does that now — by snatching terrified students off the street and taking them thousands of miles across the country without anyone knowing?\n\nThat is as flatly authoritarian as anything we have ever seen in the United States.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill Thursday banning fluoride in public water systems, making his state the first in the nation to do so. The legislation appears to be the product of health misinformation and a decline in trust in scientists since the Covid pandemic, fueled in part by conspiracy theorists like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nUtah’s law goes into effect May 7.\n\nKennedy has linked fluoride to various health maladies, despite U.S. scientists and public health groups supporting the mineral’s use, and has said the Trump administration would advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy bemoaned that he’s been labeled a conspiracy theorist for linking fluoride to low IQ levels, but the data he references has been criticized by experts. As NBC News reported:\n\nA report published recently in JAMA Pediatrics found a statistically significant association between higher fluoride exposure and lower children’s IQ scores — but the researchers did not suggest that fluoride should be removed from drinking water. According to the report’s authors, most of the 74 studies they reviewed were low-quality and done in countries other than the United States, such as China, where fluoride levels tend to be much higher, the researchers noted. An Australian study published last year found no link between early childhood exposure to fluoride and negative cognitive neurodevelopment. Researchers actually found a slightly higher IQ in kids who consistently drank fluoridated water. The levels in Australia are consistent with U.S. recommendations.\n\nScientists and major medical associations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have touted the benefits of fluoride in water for decades, particularly for children, to help prevent tooth decay and reducing cavities.\n\nUtah’s anti-fluoridation law is what happens when the MAGA movement’s anti-science efforts spur official policy.",

        "content": "As Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem toured a notorious megaprison in El Salvador on Wednesday, she took the opportunity to use the men incarcerated there as a backdrop for her latest video to warn migrants not to enter the United States illegally.\n\n“I also want everybody to know, if you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you could face,” Noem says in the video, standing in front of a cell housing dozens of shirtless, tattooed men. “First of all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted.”\n\nThe facility, known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, is a maximum-security prison built by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele that can hold up to 40,000 people. Those incarcerated at CECOT do not have visitation rights, and they are not afforded outdoor recreation time or given access to educational programs. Salvadoran officials have said those serving time in CECOT will never leave the facility.\n\nWith virtually no due process, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of Venezuelan migrants it claims are part of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador, where they are incarcerated at CECOT.\n\nIn the video, Noem warned that the administration would continue to send migrants to CECOT, calling the facility “one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.”\n\nMultiple families have said their Venezuelan relatives deported to El Salvador have no criminal records or gang affiliations, and that the administration has not provided evidence of their alleged gang membership.\n\nNoem’s video, which has been widely criticized, follows a pattern of her using immigration enforcement activities as photo ops, often with a full face of makeup and her hair blown out. True to form, in a subsequent post on X Thursday morning, Noem shared a series of glossy photos of herself touring the Salvadoran prison.",

        "title": "Mike Johnson’s pernicious threat against federal courts",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "We have three branches of government because we don’t trust one, or even two, to do the people’s work when it comes to a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Our government’s system of checks and balances is based on the idea that the dispersal of power protects the public, and that absolute power may, as the saying goes, corrupt absolutely.\n\nThe judicial branch in particular stands as a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority. When the legislative and executive branches, meant to represent the majority, overreach and threaten to trample on our individual rights, it is incumbent upon judges to step in and rebuff those attempts. Think, for instance, about a federal law that says it is illegal to burn an American flag in public. Even if Congress passes this law and the president signs it — as happened in 1968 — it violates our individual right to freedom of speech. This is the moment we need judges to step in and vindicate those rights by declaring that law invalid. Otherwise, our rights can be squashed with little recourse.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long cautioned Congress against using funding decisions to attempt to influence judicial decision-making.\n\nThis week, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson floated the idea of hobbling our lower federal courts and hence undermining our delicate system of checks and balances. He made these comments, not coincidentally, amid numerous decisions by federal judges to, at least temporarily, halt certain actions by the Trump administration. The administration’s efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport foreign nationals, to end birthright citizenship, to fire federal workers and to put a halt to certain federal spending have all run into judicial roadblocks, at least partially or temporarily halting the administration’s plans.\n\nJohnson told reporters: “We do have the authority over the federal courts, as you know. We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts and all these other things.” Johnson is largely correct: The Constitution established only the Supreme Court and left it to the legislative branch to create lower federal courts. Congress does control the purse strings and could attempt to defund federal courts, though it cannot cut the pay of federal judges while they are in office. And Article III judges, meaning judges nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can only be removed via the impeachment process.\n\nBut if Johnson and other Republicans attempted to follow through on this idea, it would erode the ability of the judicial branch to serve as a true check on the legislative and executive branches. The Supreme Court has long cautioned Congress against using funding decisions to attempt to influence judicial decision-making. Johnson’s proposal could be but one step on the way to a more authoritarian style of governance.\n\nEven short of abolishing certain lower federal courts, which Congress has done in the past, lawmakers can do plenty to hobble the work of the judiciary. Many federal judges have significant caseloads, and any cut to the funding of the federal court system could hamper their ability to function and send a chill through the judicial system. Congress could also strip lower federal courts of jurisdiction to hear certain types of cases. This process, called jurisdiction stripping, removes a swath of cases from a federal judge’s purview. Congress could, for instance, prevent lower federal courts from weighing in on disputes involving the Voting Rights Act.\n\nNone of this means that federal judges should operate in an unchecked vacuum. First, if a judge abuses their power, impeachment is the mechanism to use to remove that judge. But as Chief Justice John Roberts reminded us recently, impeachment is not a remedy for disagreement with a judicial decision. Second, if Congress disagrees with a court’s interpretation of a piece of legislation, it can pass new legislation. Third, if lawmakers believe that courts are misinterpreting the Constitution, they can amend the Constitution. That is an arduous and rare process, but it is an available remedy to check the judicial branch.\n\nWhile authoritarian regimes thrive on weak judicial systems, strong democracies thrive on robust ones.\n\nJohnson later tried to downplay his comments as merely an observation about congressional authority. But even if Johnson ultimately drops all such proposals, his initial threat alone was pernicious. The mere suggestion that Congress could retaliate against a co-equal branch could make judges think twice before issuing decisions against the interest of the legislative branch. It is not unreasonable to hear Johnson’s comments and think that one party is attempting to control one of the last backstops against many of President Donald Trump’s attempts to enlarge the power of the executive branch.\n\nWhen members of the political branches disagree with federal judicial decisions, the solution is to attempt to pass or repeal legislation through a deliberative process, not to attempt to erase the power of the federal judiciary. While authoritarian regimes thrive on weak judicial systems, strong democracies thrive on robust ones. To protect democracy, we must protect the main safeguard of democracy: a strong judicial branch. Gutting the judicial branch will gut its ability to protect the public from majoritarian overreach.",

The Justice Department’s independence has been an important modern value in the post-Watergate era. But it’s an understatement to say that the current administration is testing that value.\n\nOf course, the department isn’t entirely unrelated to the president. It’s not a coincidence that DOJ priorities can shift every four or eight years. In every administration, the president appoints DOJ officials — some of whom are subject to Senate confirmation — whose views are at least somewhat aligned with the president’s or else they wouldn’t be picked.\n\nBut the alignment between the DOJ and this White House is extreme. The lawyers leading the department are Trump’s personal attorneys from his criminal and impeachment cases; they now wield the awesome power of the federal government on his behalf. As Attorney General Pam Bondi put it: DOJ lawyers are “his lawyers.”\n\nOne of the greatest independence tests is when presidents themselves face potential legal jeopardy. We have several data points on this subject over the years, including from Trump’s first term. But look even more recently to when Joe Biden was investigated related to classified documents. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed a special counsel (a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney) for the matter. Announcing that appointment, Garland said it “underscores for the public the Department’s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters, and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law.”\n\nWould Bondi do the same? The answer to that question is the same answer to the question of who this DOJ serves.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me? I’d love to hear from you!

        "content": "Interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin has been having a rough go at things since President Donald Trump picked the former lawyer for Jan. 6 defendants — who on the day of the attack tweeted that he was at the Capitol and relayed the “love, faith and joy” at the scene — to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.\n\nI wrote last month about Martin’s rage over media leaks apparently coming from staffers in his office. And this week, he received fierce backlash during an appearance in one of the Blackest communities in D.C.\n\nThe Washingtonian magazine published a dispatch from Martin’s trip to Anacostia, a neighborhood that is nearly 90% Black, for a discussion with local leaders about crime. On its face, this appearance seemed ripe for controversy, given that Martin is a staunch supporter of the insurrectionists who waged a Ku Klux Klan-style attack on the Capitol, with gallows and all.\n\nAnd apparently, Martin’s disconnect from attendees was glaringly obvious. According to the Washingtonian, he made an attempt to drive a wedge between Anacostia residents and Africans who have benefited from foreign aid. And it didn’t go over well.\n\nPer the Washingtonian:\n\nClearly a back-slapping, friendly person by nature, he began his appearance with a somewhat conciliatory tone, telling the crowd “you’re the experts on what’s happening in the community,” and name-dropping the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site as commemorating “one of the great historic folks.” But he struggled to keep it relatable. By a few minutes in, he brought up the embattled USAID in what he clearly thought was a slam dunk: “When USAID sent hundreds of millions of dollars to central Africa, didn’t you ask, ‘why didn’t you send it to 7D? (the Seventh District),” he asked. There was an immediate and resounding “no” from the crowd. “You didn’t?,” Martin scoffed. “Well you should. I did.”\n\nThis was a pretty disgusting attempt by Martin to sow division by invoking U.S. Agency for International Development cuts, which are inhibiting everything from HIV treatment to maternal health care in Africa.\n\nMartin appeared to be taking tips from his boss here: President Donald Trump peddled this same kind of “foreigners are taking your money” schlock, particularly to Black audiences, during last year’s campaign. And the Washingtonian noted that Martin was called out on this by Cora Masters Barry, the widow of former Washington Mayor Marion Barry:\n\nA few minutes later, Cora Masters Barry, Marion Barry’s widow, took issue, giving Martin the most severe dressing down of the day. “You need to learn your politics,” she said. “You need to learn geography, and world affairs. There’s a whole different pot of money that goes to Africa that stops diseases…. You don’t know what you talking about, so be careful about what you say when you go places, because you show that you’re not well read.”\n\nOuch. She basically called Martin an ignoramus to his face. And Barry didn’t stop there:\n\nBarry also pointed out that Martin, in his focus on crime, ignored the fact that DC had already made progress. “You haven’t once mentioned Metropolitan [Police Department],” she said. “You haven’t talked about the chief of police, who’s doing a great job of bringing crime down. So you can’t sit there and talk about what you gonna do as if something’s not being done already. What you do is you walk in and you say: ‘what’s being done and how can I help?’”\n\nShe reportedly received applause when she advised Martin to “be careful how you talk to us.”\n\nThis seems to have been a pretty disastrous showing by Martin, whose MAGA messaging clearly goes over well with hardcore Trump supporters — and far less so with residents of Anacostia. At least those residents appear to see him more as an occupying force in D.C., which Trump has said he wants to “take over,” than a helpful partner to its communities.",

        "title": "Trump hopes the Signal scandal will go away. We can't let that happen.",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "When you’re using the Signal app, you can set your chats to automatically disappear after a few days.\n\nThe Donald Trump administration is hoping that a scandal over top officials’ use of Signal to discuss impending military plans will similarly disappear, as so many other controversies already have.\n\nIt brought to mind the old World War II posters admonishing GIs against sharing information on troop movements: “Loose lips sink ships.”\n\nIt’s up to Democrats and responsible Republicans in Congress to make sure that doesn’t happen.\n\nThis is no ordinary offense. The conduct here raises questions about the handling of America’s secrets, the safety of our troops and the accuracy of our public records.\n\nAnd the Trump administration has already shown that it can’t be trusted to police this matter itself, while a Republican call for the Defense Department’s inspector general to investigate is insufficient. Only Congress can do this job.\n\nThe scandal came to light when The Atlantic’s editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging service Signal, where he was privy to messages from Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, national security adviser Michael Waltz and a host of others — all discussing with alarming detail planned strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nIt brought to mind the old World War II posters admonishing GIs against sharing information on troop movements: “Loose lips sink ships.” But these weren’t privates getting overly chatty in a bar; these were some of the highest officials in the government deciding on the plans and sharing details of the timing and location on a commercially available app.\n\nMake no mistake: It is only due to Goldberg’s integrity and sheer dumb luck that this recklessness didn’t result in dead Americans, yet the Trump administration is repeatedly making the conscious choice to lie to the American people, downplaying the shocking ineptitude these messages reveal.\n\nFrom the White House briefing room, press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the text messages — which included specific strike times and weapons systems — did not contain classified information but was rather a “sensationalized story.” Hegseth promised that no one was texting “war plans,” a claim that’s hard to reconcile with what Hegseth wrote in the chat: “THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP.” Waltz even shockingly suggested — without a shred of evidence — that Goldberg somehow surreptitiously infiltrated the chat.\n\nFor his part, Trump claimed not to know anything about the story before resorting to his cliched attacks on the press, calling it a “witch hunt.”\n\nIt’s clear this administration is hoping the colossal failure blows over and Americans move on. We — as a nation — cannot allow that to happen. Now is not the time for lawmakers to sit idly by. Every member of Congress who’s ever claimed to care about the lives of American service members needs to step in and exercise the body’s power as a co-equal branch of government.\n\nThis goes far beyond a group chat, an encrypted app, or even a single military strike. This is about the very machinery of national security — how this administration makes decisions that can ripple across the globe in an instant.\n\nAt stake is whether our allies continue to trust us with their most sensitive intelligence. Whether an enemy spots a covert operation before it’s complete. Whether a soldier makes it home to see their child grow up.\n\nThis isn’t just about policy. It’s about life and death, trust and betrayal, and the fragile line between order and chaos.\n\nThe the administration cannot be trusted to investigate itself.\n\nIt must be Congress that leads an investigation because the uncomfortable truth is this: The administration cannot be trusted to investigate itself.\n\nOn Wednesday, Leavitt claimed that billionaire Elon Musk’s team would look into how Goldberg ended up in that explosive chat. Let’s be clear: That’s not oversight, that’s gaslighting. We know how Goldberg was added — Waltz brought him in. The receipts are right there in black and white in the texts published by The Atlantic.\n\nSo ask yourself: Why would a tech billionaire with no jurisdiction and plenty of conflicts of interest be tasked with uncovering the truth? Why not the FBI? Why not the Department of Justice? Why not anyone with actual authority and accountability?\n\nEspecially when Musk’s own office, the Department of Government Efficiency, is already under scrutiny for attempting to access sensitive government information. This isn’t just a distraction; it’s a smoke screen.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker has called on the Department of Defense’s inspector general to probe the scandal, but that won’t work either. Acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins has “acting” in front of his title because Trump fired his predecessor. He’s in no position to hold the administration’s feet to the fire.\n\nOnly Congress can actively pursue a full-scale investigation to answer the questions raised by this scandal. It is up to the public to demand real accountability from their representatives.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Symone Sanders-Townsend, Michael Steele and Alicia Menendez, watch “The Weekend” every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Blurring the distinction between substance and process is a tactic of disinformation. The Trump administration is using the technique in its efforts to deport immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, but the courts are seeing through it.\n\nOn Wednesday, an appeals court upheld an order to block President Donald Trump’s administration from using the 1798 statute to deport people it says are members of a violent Venezuelan gang known as Tren De Aragua.\n\nThe administration knows that most Americans support the removal of transnational criminal members of a gang it recently designated a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThe substance of Trump’s policy has broad appeal. The administration knows that most Americans support the removal of transnational criminal members of a gang it recently designated a foreign terrorist organization. And Trump frequently invokes his strong “mandate” to engage in aggressive immigration enforcement, which was a major theme of his campaign.\n\nWhen district court Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportations on March 15, Attorney General Pam Bondi blasted the judge for “supporting the Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans.” In fact, Judge Boasberg is not “supporting” either party. He is supporting the law. The legal problem isn’t with what the administration is doing; it is how the administration is doing it.\n\nIn a 2-1 decision Wednesday, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also ruled against the administration, rejecting an emergency motion to overturn District Court Boasberg’s decision to stop the program temporarily. Two judges, one appointed by a Republican president and one by a Democrat, wrote concurring opinions noting problems with the application of the statute and the apparent denial of due process.\n\nIn her concurring opinion, Judge Karen L. Henderson explained that the Alien Enemies Act applies only in wartime. At the moment, of course, the United States is not at war. As Judge Henderson wrote, the Alien Enemies Act was enacted during a time when “our fledging nation was consumed with fear” of a war with France and “internal strife from her sympathizers.” As a result, Congress passed a package of bills known as the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act would permit the president to expel “enemies” during times of war. The problem with using that statute now, of course, is that none of those conditions are currently being met. A counterpart to the statute known as the Alien Friends Act was passed for use in times of peace. That statute permitted the removal of any immigrant the president deemed “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.” Why, you might ask, did the Trump administration not simply use the Alien Friends Act to deport this group? That’s because, as the court noted, the statute was immediately seen as unconstitutional and allowed to lapse in 1800.\n\nBut that’s where the how becomes a problem. As Judge Henderson explained, the language of the Alien Enemies Act requires a “declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government” or “an invasion or predatory incursion ... against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation of government.” Happily, we are not at war, which, under the Constitution, may be declared only by Congress. Nor have we experienced any “invasion” or “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation or government.\n\nDespite the government’s argument that unwanted migrants who cross the border unlawfully have “invaded” our country, the court said that those terms as used in the statute instead must be considered in their “military sense.” Indeed, the court noted that James Madison had called the statute “an exercise of the power of war.” The court concluded that the words “invasion” and “predatory incursion” in the statute must be read to mean a “hostile encroachment by a nation state.” Because these conditions do not exist, the plaintiffs in this case have shown a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their lawsuit against the administration.\n\nIn another concurring opinion, Judge Patricia Millet explained her concerns with how the administration is deporting the plaintiffs, noting the apparent denial of due process.\n\nIn another concurring opinion, Judge Patricia Millet explained her concerns with how the administration is deporting the plaintiffs, noting the apparent denial of due process. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees due process to anyone within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States before they can be denied life, liberty or property. Courts have long held that due process rights apply to immigrants, legal or not, in deportation proceedings. The basic requirements of due process are fair notice, an opportunity to be heard and an impartial decision-maker. The individuals in this case received none of these procedural safeguards to determine whether they are, in fact, noncitizens who are members of Tren de Aragua. The judge noted that some of the men were designated as gang members based on tattoos matching those found in a Google search.\n\nThe case now goes back to Judge Boasberg’s courtroom for further proceedings, including the court’s order that the government show that it did not violate his initial order to halt the departure of planes and their return, as well as its refusal to answer his questions about those issues.\n\nThe Trump administration no doubt handpicked members of a transnational criminal gang to test the waters for aggressive immigration enforcement, gambling that most members of the public would be happy to see them go. But by focusing only on the substantive goal of ridding our country of individuals it deems dangerous criminals, the administration steamrolls over the lawful process that protects any of us from getting ensnared in a net by mistake or abuse. Under the law, sound process is required to yield effective substance.",

I’ll be known as the fertilization president and that’s OK.”\n\n“That’s not bad,” Trump went on, adding that he had been called “much worse” than the nickname he seemed to have just made up on the spot. “Actually, I like it, right?”\n\nTrump otherwise hit familiar notes in his speech at the event. He bragged about women’s support for him in the 2024 election, attacked transgender people and hailed his executive order to abolish the Education Department.\n\nBut his remarks about “fertilization” follow a record of awkward and patronizing remarks he has made while trying to make a case for himself to women. During the 2024 campaign, Trump dubbed himself the “father of IVF” as he tried to win over female voters by promising to have the government pay for fertility treatments — even as he admitted that he’d never heard of the procedure prior to a controversial Alabama Supreme Court decision to recognize frozen embryos as legal persons. Trump also vowed to be a “protector” of women — whom he said were abandoned, scared and in danger — “whether the women like it or not,” echoing the disturbing rhetoric of pickup artists, as my colleague Ja’han Jones pointed out at the time.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "House Republican leaders really didn’t need another controversy surrounding one of their members, but they apparently have one anyway.\n\nIt was last month when Republican Rep. Cory Mills of Florida first generated national headlines when NBC News reported that the local police department in Washington, D.C., had begun an investigation into the congressman, following a report of an alleged assault. NBC News went on to report soon after that the Metropolitan Police Department in the nation’s capital “sent an arrest warrant” on Mills to interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin’s office, but the warrant went unsigned by the hyper-partisan Trump-appointed prosecutor.\n\nThe GOP congressman issued a statement “vehemently” denying any wrongdoing, claiming that law enforcement “was asked to resolve a private matter” at Mills’ residence. The story soon faded.\n\nUnfortunately for the Florida Republican, however, he’s now confronting an entirely different controversy. Roll Call reported:\n\nIn one of its first actions of the new Congress, the House Ethics Committee announced Thursday it would conduct a further review of allegations against Rep. Cory Mills. It comes after an August 2024 referral from the Office of Congressional Conduct, which found the Florida Republican may have omitted or misrepresented information in financial disclosure reports and kept contracts with the federal government.\n\nWhile congressional ethics are often nuanced and complex, the basic elements of this story are rather straightforward: To avoid conflicts of interest, lawmakers cannot personally benefit from government contracts. Mills, according to investigators, is directly tied to two businesses that did, in fact, receive contracts for munition and weapons for prisons, sparking the controversy.\n\n“There is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Mills may have entered into, held, or enjoyed contracts with federal agencies while he was a Member of Congress,” the Office of Congressional Conduct report concluded.\n\nA Politico report added that the OCC “also found some evidence that Mills may have ‘omitted or misrepresented’ information on his financial disclosure forms.”\n\nThe Republican lawmaker chose not to cooperate with the investigation, though his office issued a statement insisting that Mills is “committed to complying with all laws and ethics rules.” The statement noted that the Federal Election Commission recently dismissed a related complaint, and Mills and his team “trust the House Ethics Committee will come to a similar conclusion.”\n\nMills has reportedly expressed an interest in running for statewide office in the 2026 election cycle. Whether his recent controversies would help or hurt his ambitions is unclear.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The details are still coming into focus, but the publicly available information is clearly alarming. Four U.S. soldiers, who were conducting tactical training, recently went missing while training in Lithuania. The Associated Press reported, “The U.S. Army said the Hercules armored vehicle the four U.S. soldiers were in during a training exercise had been found submerged in a body of water. It said recovery efforts were underway by U.S. Army and Lithuanian Armed Forces and civilian agencies.”\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte initially said the American troops had perished in the incident, though he soon after clarified that the search is ongoing. As if this weren’t serious enough, there’s also the relevance of the location: The exercise was conducted at a training ground roughly 6 miles from the border with Belarus — and Belarus is closely aligned with Vladimir Putin’s Russia.\n\nGiven all of this, it stands to reason that Donald Trump would be up to speed on the details and the status of the search for the American service members. He is, after all, the president and the commander in chief of the armed forces. And yet, HuffPost noted:\n\nDonald Trump appeared unaware on Wednesday that four U.S. soldiers had gone missing during a NATO training exercise in Lithuania. When asked by a reporter if he had been briefed on the situation that began to unfurl hours before, the president replied, “No, I haven’t.”\n\nHe didn’t elaborate. In fact, the president simply moved on to another question.\n\nTo be sure, it’s difficult to know whether Trump was telling the truth. Perhaps he’d been briefed but chose to lie about his knowledge of the incident. But taken at face value, four U.S. troops went missing roughly 6 miles from a Russia-aligned country, and the American president was left totally in the dark about the state of the efforts to find them.\n\nAround the same time, the Republican was also asked about the Signal group chat scandal and whether he believed classified information was shared. “I don’t know,” he replied. “I’m not sure, you have to ask the various people involved.”\n\nThe comments came after the public saw the details of the online chat, which included a message from Trump’s vice president, JD Vance, telling the White House’s national security team that he wasn’t sure “the president is aware how inconsistent” the proposed strike in Yemen was “with his message on Europe.”\n\nThe same text chain featured the White House’s Stephen Miller adding, in apparent reference to the attack plan, “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light.”\n\nThe problems should be obvious: Vance was uncertain about Trump’s knowledge of the relevant details, and one of the president’s right-hand loyalists added an “as I heard it” qualifier to the commander in chief’s directive about a deadly military operation abroad.\n\nTaken together, it’s difficult not to wonder just how out of the loop the president is in his own White House.\n\nFive years ago this month, as the severity of the pandemic came into focus, The New York Times published a memorable analysis that included a word to describe Trump that stood out for me as significant: “bystander.”\n\n“While he presents himself as the nation’s commanding figure, Mr. Trump has essentially become a bystander as school superintendents, sports commissioners, college presidents, governors and business owners across the country take it upon themselves to shut down much of American life without clear guidance from the president,” the Times explained.\n\nA half-decade later, it appears President Bystander has returned. Trump has taken a keen interest in playing golf, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, banning paper straws, watching an enormous amount of television and helping steer the Kennedy Center — but on life-or-death issues, he’s offering the public a lot of shrugged shoulders and blank stares.\n\nFor a president who’s heavily invested in the idea that his immediate predecessor had no idea what was going on around him, Trump’s apparent cluelessness should be a serious problem.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "About a month ago, the White House took an unprecedented step, punishing a prominent private law firm because Donald Trump disapproved of its clients. The New York Times described the move as “a breathtaking escalation,” and that description was more than fair.\n\nThe move, however, was simply an opening salvo. A week later, the Republican nevertheless did it again, targeting a different firm. A third firm was punished soon after, followed by a fourth. (Trump also signed an executive order last week that effectively threatened to punish any law firms that, from his perspective, challenge his administration in ways he considers “unreasonable.”)\n\nThe list is still growing. NBC News reported:\n\nTrump signed an executive order today suspending the security clearances for employees at the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP which previously employed Robert Mueller, a special counsel who led the Russia investigation after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe president’s directive accused the firm of, among other things, engaging in “obvious partisan representations.” Just as notably, the White House said in a statement that WilmerHale “rewarded” the former special counsel, whose investigation, in Trump’s estimation, “epitomizes the weaponization of government.”\n\nRight off the bat, it’s important to emphasize just how utterly bonkers these circumstances are. There is no precedent in the American tradition of a White House punishing a private law firm because it hired a lawyer the sitting president does not like. This is not the sort of thing that is supposed to happen in a healthy and free democratic country.\n\nComplicating matters, the idea that Mueller is some kind of super villain is so preposterous that it’s unsettling to see the White House put such a claim in writing. Mueller is, after all, a decorated Marine combat veteran, a lifelong Republican and the former director of the FBI.\n\nYes, he also oversaw an investigation into the Russia scandal, but (a) the scandal was real and serious, even if Trump pretends otherwise; (b) Mueller did nothing wrong before, during or after the probe; (c) serving as a special counsel does not mean a lawyer should be blacklisted for life; (d) Mueller was appointed by the Trump administration, which makes it hilarious to see Trump characterize his work as an example of “weaponization”; and (e) the president has spent the last several years claiming that Mueller cleared him of any wrongdoing in the scandal.\n\nTo be sure, Trump has obviously lied repeatedly about Mueller’s findings, but taken at face value, the president has told the public that the former special counsel “exonerated” him in the Russia scandal.\n\nIf that’s the case, why punish the firm that employed him?\n\nAs for the larger context, not every major law firm is responding to the White House’s offensive the same way. One has already caved, and another appears prepared to caved preemptively to avoid a presidential attack.\n\nThat said, one of the targeted firms is challenging a Trump order in court, and just hours ago, two more firms filed separate lawsuits seeking to block enforcement of the president’s directive.\n\nTrump boasted publicly earlier this week about law firms caving to his demands and giving the White House what it wants, but as things stand, not every firm is bending the knee.",

        "title": "Trump order targets ‘improper’ ideology at the Smithsonian Institution",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As this week got underway, the public learned about an executive order from Donald Trump that targeted a series of government agencies to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.” Included on the list was the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an independent agency described by The New York Times as “the federal government’s main source of support for the nation’s libraries, museums and archives.”\n\nAs the week neared its end, one specific museum — by some measures, the nation’s most famous — was apparently on the president’s mind. NBC News reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday taking aim at the Smithsonian and its museums, education and research centers. Trump directed Vice President JD Vance to eliminate ‘improper, divisive, or anti-American’ ideology from programs at the Smithsonian Institution, which receives federal funding.\n\nThe same order accused the Biden administration of, among other things, using the Smithsonian to advance what the Republican president described as a “corrosive” ideology.\n\nHow does the White House define words such as “improper,” “divisive,” “anti-American” and “corrosive” in an ideological context? The order didn’t say. Presumably, Trump knows it when he sees it.\n\nHe went on to characterize the Smithsonian as an institution that was “once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement” — before it fell victim to a nefarious ideology that Trump considers “divisive.”\n\nAs part of the same directive, Vance — a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents — will be responsible for identifying and appointing Smithsonian board members who will commit to “advancing the celebration of America’s extraordinary heritage and progress.”\n\nIt was around this time two years ago when The Washington Post reported that the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery accepted a $650,000 contribution from the Republican’s Save America PAC to fund the official portraits of Donald and Melania Trump.\n\nIf the institution hoped that the arrangement might generate some goodwill, those hopes have apparently been dashed.\n\nAs part of the new executive order, the president also directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to overhaul federal parks and monuments that perpetuate a version of history that the White House considers “false.”\n\nWho’ll decide which historical claims are deemed accurate? The order didn’t say that, either, though it’s difficult to be optimistic.\n\nIt comes on the heels of Trump’s recent takeover of the Kennedy Center, part of which included his desire to see the arts institution put on productions in line with his cultural vision.\n\nPerhaps the president can expedite matters by creating some kind committee to examine content he considers un-American?\n\nThe title on the White House’s order said the directive is intended to restore “sanity to American history.” Given the circumstances, “sanity” is not the word that comes to mind.",

        "title": "Trump admin's proposed ACA changes hurt transgender people like me",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "I quit my full-time job as a bank teller to become a full-time freelance journalist on April 20, 2017. I had never done anything so rash before. I was always the person who made reasonable decisions, going from safe job to safe job, trying to slowly build a better life for myself. But after successfully publishing a few scattered bylines in online outlets like Vice, I decided to jump off the career cliff into the great unknown of working for myself.\n\nMy access to that essential care is now being quietly threatened by the Trump administration.\n\nAnd I couldn’t have done it without the Affordable Care Act and its coverage of gender-affirming care.\n\nBut my access to that essential care is now being quietly threatened by the Trump administration. Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services put out a proposed rule that would change a wide range of policies under the ACA — including shortening the open enrollment period by a full month, ending eligibility for ACA plans for DACA recipients and no longer requiring gender-affirming care coverage as an essential health benefit on all ACA individual and small group plans.\n\n“This means that insurance plans would no longer be required to cover treatments related to gender transition, such as hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgeries,” Matthew Rose, senior public policy advocate at the Human Rights Campaign, told me in a statement. “As a result, many insurers may drop coverage for these services or shift the costs to individuals and states. If a state mandates coverage for gender-affirming care outside of the federal EHB requirements, it would have to pay for the coverage itself. This could make gender-affirming care more expensive or inaccessible for transgender individuals, particularly those with lower incomes.”\n\nIf this rule, which is open for public comment, gets implemented, I could lose coverage for vital hormone prescriptions and doctor’s appointments.\n\nI’m not alone in worrying about this. According to available data, trans people are more likely to be uninsured than the average cisgender person, and though numbers are hard to come by, trans people appear much more likely to get insurance from a government-subsidized program like the ACA or Medicaid.\n\nHHS estimates that more than 45 million people have ACA plan insurance. If you use the conservative estimate that 0.6% of the population is trans, rough math says that as many as 270,000 people could lose access to the gender-affirming care coverage that they’re currently paying for. The rule, if put into place, would go into effect starting next year, depending on the outcome of likely inevitable lawsuits.\n\nThe proposed rule change has gotten surprisingly little media attention so far, with few outlets reporting on it. The administration’s quiet rollout has seemingly worked, as the rule had received only about 5,400 public comments as of Tuesday morning.\n\nNevertheless, a ban of this nature on gender-affirming care would be unprecedented. This type of care has been consistently covered since 2016, including through the entirety of President Donald Trump’s first term.\n\nAnd this proposed rule, more so than the passport nonsense outlined in the administration’s early executive orders, represents the most alarming government attack on my personal life since Trump took back the White House.\n\nConservatives have a track record of trying to cut funding for things they don’t like by claiming “my tax dollars shouldn’t fund that” — think, “my tax dollars shouldn’t fund abortions.” Now they’re doing the same thing here, claiming they should have personal veto power over tax dollars spent on trans people they have increasingly villainized in recent years.\n\nBut the conservative argument doesn’t work here, for several reasons. In my case, I don’t receive government subsidies for my ACA plan, meaning I pay the entire $500 premium every month myself, with my own money, out of my own pocket. Your tax dollars aren’t going toward my health insurance; it’s just that the government set up the marketplace I buy my plan on.\n\nThis is like buying a car and then eight years later having the owner of the car dealership show up on your doorstep to tell you that you can’t drive it in Vermont anymore.\n\nit’s weird that we have afforded conservatives special rights to divest taxpayer dollars from whichever policy they find offensive.\n\nThe second reason this argument doesn’t work is that no one else is given such deference in politics. When George W. Bush was in office, I couldn’t, as a liberal, stop the government from using my tax dollars to fund wars I opposed. I couldn’t stop the government from using my tax dollars to pay for the expansion of the surveillance state. Right now, I can’t demand that my tax dollars not enable whatever the heck DOGE is doing. (And all of these examples dwarf the amount of money the U.S. spends on abortions or transition care.)\n\nThat’s not how politics works. And it’s weird that we have afforded conservatives special rights to divest taxpayer dollars from whichever policy they find offensive.\n\nWhen I made the jump to working for myself, someone else was able to take my position at the bank, helping to lower the unemployment rate. If my essential health care gets ripped away from the public marketplace, I’ll be forced to again compete for a job that someone else probably needs more than I do, simply so I can get the appropriate health care.\n\nRegardless of the politics of the moment, we shouldn’t be discouraging folks like the 2017 version of myself. I took a leap of faith, backed by a belief in my own abilities and confidence in a government-run insurance marketplace. If you agree, feel free to leave a public comment letting Trump know that this rule shouldn’t go through.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered Trump administration officials to preserve communications from the messaging application Signal that featured in the recent scandal stemming from officials’ discussing military operations in a group chat that included a journalist who wasn’t supposed to be there.\n\nAfter a hearing Thursday, the judge issued an order stating that government defendants “shall promptly make best efforts to preserve all Signal communications from March 11-15, 2025.” It further said the defendants need to file a status report by Monday detailing the steps they’ve taken to preserve those messages.\n\nWatchdog group American Oversight sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials following the publication on Monday of a shocking report about the chat. The communications occurred over Signal, which can be set up to delete messages automatically.\n\nAmerican Oversight’s lawsuit seeks to “prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records and to compel Defendants to fulfill their legal obligations to preserve and recover federal records created through unauthorized use of Signal for sensitive national security decision-making,” according to the group’s legal complaint filed Tuesday.\n\nThe group moved for a temporary restraining order, asking Boasberg to order Hegseth, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately desist from unlawfully destroying federal records in violation of the Federal Records Act.”\n\nMore specifically, the group asked Boasberg to order that officials:\n\n(a) take steps to ensure the preservation of any federal records that were created between March 11 and March 15, 2025, regarding and including any messages that are or were contained in “the Signal chat,” as referenced in the Complaint ... ; (b) ... initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of any destroyed federal records that were created between March 11 and March 15, 2025, regarding and including any messages that are or were contained in “the Signal chat,” as referenced in the Complaint ... and (c) take steps to confirm that the use of any electronic messaging applications with an auto-delete function by any Defendant individually or within their respective agencies, including Signal, complies with all requirements of the Federal Records Act ... and the related rules and regulations of their respective agencies.\n\nAhead of Thursday’s hearing, the government defendants argued in a memo that the group’s claim that officials failed to take measures to prevent the destruction of Signal messages “is not reviewable.” They also argued that a restraining order is unnecessary “because the Defendant agencies are already taking steps to locate and preserve the Signal chat at issue, and at least one agency has already located, preserved, and copied into a federal record keeping system a partial version of the chat.”\n\nBefore being assigned to preside over this case, Boasberg was already handling another high-profile national security-related matter, over the administration’s deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. Boasberg, the chief federal trial judge in Washington, D.C., issued temporary restraining orders in that case and raised questions about whether officials had violated his orders. Litigation in that case is continuing after a divided federal appeals court panel declined to upend Boasberg’s restraining orders.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for Boasberg’s impeachment after he ruled against the administration in the deportation litigation, which led Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare public statement stressing that the proper response to an adverse ruling is an appeal, not an impeachment.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "On MLB Opening Day, here’s how to stop price gouging at the ballpark",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Today, alongside nearly a million fellow sports fans, I’ll make my way to the ballpark to watch the first game of the 2025 Major League Baseball season. As a former college baseball player and diehard Washington Nationals fan, I’ll take in a game at Nationals Park, which cost almost $700 million when it was built nearly 20 years ago. That tab was paid almost entirely by D.C. taxpayers, even though the Nats’ majority owners, the Lerner family, are real estate magnates worth an estimated $6.4 billion. Before sitting down to watch first pitch, I’ll pick up a hot dog, a bag of Cracker Jack and a cold beer. This year, that will set me back a staggering $29.\n\nBaseball, like other major professional sports, is big business. MLB brought in $12.1 billion in revenue last year, thanks in no small part to the attendance of more than 70 million fans. The top five professional sports leagues in North America brought in more than $50 billion combined in 2024. While team valuations, player salaries and owners’ net worths climb higher, it has become increasingly unaffordable for an average American family to catch a game. A family of four can expect to spend an average of $240 for tickets, concessions and parking at a Major League Baseball game. An NFL game will set them back a whopping $631. Though most teams collect only a small percentage of overall revenue from concessions, prices continue to rise, reaching levels double or triple what you would find just across the street at a grocery store or a restaurant.\n\nNearly 80% of airports, which are also heavily funded by taxpayers, are covered by some form of “street pricing plus.”\n\nThe good news is: There’s a way to rein in this price gouging at the concession stand. While there may not yet be a policy solution for getting my Nationals back to the playoffs, we can stop publicly funded venues from ripping off families, who are often barred from bringing their own food and drink in for an affordable snack.\n\nThese days, sports stadiums are nearly always backed by taxpayer funding at the local, state and federal levels, meaning fans are footing the bills on both ends. These funding deals are sold with promises of economic development and community benefits that too often fail to materialize. Even the vendors are big businesses of their own. The Nationals exclusively contract with the concessionaire Levy Restaurants, whose parent company made nearly $3 billion in profits last year.\n\nState, local and federal policymakers should institute what’s called “street pricing” for venues that are funded by taxpayer dollars, as my team at Groundwork Collaborative outlines in a new policy brief. This means that vendors can only charge prices of comparable items outside the stadium at restaurants or convenience stores. Nearly 80% of airports, which are also heavily funded by taxpayers, are covered by some form of “street pricing plus.”\n\nStadiums and arenas are often financed by Private Activity Bonds, which are federally tax-deductible. As a condition of tax exemption, venues financed by Private Activity Bonds should institute strict street pricing policies. State and local policymakers should require street pricing policies as part of negotiated economic development deals for new stadiums and other venues.\n\nAs LaGuardia Airport’s infamous $9.99 Chex Mix proves, though, these policies are often stretched to the point of incredulity and rarely enforced. With that in mind, then, lawmakers should be sure street pricing requirements include rigorous enforcement. And while we’re at it, the Federal Aviation Administration likewise should condition airport funding on stronger street pricing policies and enforcement.\n\nIn return for massive public subsidies, the least billionaire sports owners can do is offer their loyal fans affordable concessions.\n\nStreet pricing requirements would not just be pro-consumer; they would be pro-business. In acknowledgment of fan outrage at high prices, some teams have voluntarily instituted caps on concession prices or special offers. At every Tuesday home game, my Nationals offer $5 concessions, as well as discounted tickets and parking. When Mercedes-Benz Stadium opened in 2017, the Atlanta Falcons instituted a fan-friendly pricing model, slashing concession prices by 50% compared with those in their previous stadium, offering $2 hot dogs and $5 beers. The discount paid off — transactions, revenues and merchandise sales are up, and its fan experience tops the NFL. Portland International Airport has had strict street pricing since the 1980s and enjoys retail sales well above the national average.\n\nAs families are squeezed by rising costs for everything from groceries to housing to utilities and giant corporations institute even more elaborate strategies and fees to squeeze every last penny from consumers, an affordable game at the ballpark is the least they can ask for. In return for massive public subsidies, the least billionaire sports owners can do is offer their loyal fans affordable concessions.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump defended his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, the creator of the infamous Signal group chat in which administration officials reportedly planned major military strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. Trump said Waltz had “learned a lesson” after the national security adviser added Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the group — about as close as it seems the president will come to acknowledging the egregious act of discussing a U.S. military operation on a commercial chat app.\n\nWhile Waltz has rightfully come under fire for starting the chat and adding Goldberg, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth deserves the most scrutiny.\n\nToday, the full extent of Hegseth’s texts in the Signal thread at 11:44 a.m. March 15 were revealed. It was Hegseth who posted a “TEAM UPDATE” that contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen.\n\nIt was Hegseth who put the precise timing and sequencing of the entire operation into an unclassified text app.\n\nIt was Hegseth who revealed the aircraft that would be used to conduct the strikes before the operation took place.\n\nIt was Hegseth who moved classified information to a commercial text app that could have been intercepted by our adversaries.\n\nAnd it was Hegseth who put our brave service members, including the fighter pilots preparing to conduct the operation, in mortal danger.\n\nThe Atlantic’s reporting is full of shocking revelations about how the entire national security apparatus and some of the most powerful people in the world apparently make military decisions as casually as a group of friends planning a dinner.\n\nBy typing this information into a Signal chat, Hegseth created the possibility that an adversary could see what the U.S. military was planning to do, who was being targeted and when it was going to happen. Even an encrypted app like Signal is not immune from hackers. Just days before this security breach, a Pentagonwide advisory warned that “a vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application” and that “Russian professional hacking groups” were looking to exploit it.\n\nThere is not a military operation in modern American history whose planning isn’t classified.\n\nThough the White House and top intelligence officials have denied that any classified information was shared on the chat, there is not a military operation in modern American history whose planning isn’t classified. What’s more, classified systems are physically separate from unclassified ones — different email addresses, different servers, no ability to copy and paste information from one to the other. That means Hegseth had to open his classified email or binder, and manually type the military strike details into Signal.\n\nDetails of operations falling into the wrong hands give adversaries the ability to wreak havoc on the operation — or worse, retaliate against our troops. Imagine if a hacking group linked to Iran was able to penetrate the Signal chat. It’s not hard to picture an adversarial group selling the content of Hegseth’s 11:44 a.m. text to the Houthis or their backers in Iran, who have previously helped the Houthis shoot down unmanned U.S. aircraft. Armed with head start knowledge of where U.S. planes were flying and when, the Houthis could have targeted U.S. military fighter jets and ships participating in the strike — possibly leading to catastrophic consequences.\n\nDue to the incredible ineptitude of Hegseth and the individuals on the Signal thread by somehow unknowingly inviting a reporter into their group chat, how can our allies and partners trust the United States with sensitive and classified information? Who is to say there aren’t more of these chats?\n\nPreventing those sorts of outcomes is why discussions of operations are held in classified rooms, where the commander overseeing the strike — in this case, the commander of U.S. Central Command — presents the plan to those authorized to be there. When I worked as a Pentagon spokesperson, we would not even confirm an operation took place unless we knew the operation had concluded and our pilots were safe. It’s this level of security and caution that protect our troops who put their lives on the line for their country.\n\nHegseth bragged about restoring meritocracy and competence to the Pentagon. In less than 100 days, he has done the opposite. It is time for Congress to investigate why the defense secretary of the world’s most powerful military risked the lives of our U.S. service members, all for the convenience of a group chat.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 26 episode of “The Rachel Maddow Show.”\n\nTypically, in March of an odd-numbered year, we don’t get a lot of big election news. However, that isn’t the case this year. On Tuesday, we got two major results out of two elections in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania state House, Democrats won a special election that will hand them control of that legislative chamber. The win wasn’t much of a surprise since it was considered a Democratic-leaning district. In November, Kamala Harris won it by 16 points. That said, there was still a bit of good news for Democrats, because even though Harris won that district by 16 points, on Tuesday the Democratic candidate, Dan Goughnour, did even better — he won by nearly 30 points. That’s a huge margin, and reason alone for Pennsylvania Democrats to celebrate.\n\nRepublicans are reportedly growing concerned after the Democratic candidate out-fundraised the GOP candidate by more than 10-to-1.\n\nBut there was also another election in the state, this one for a seat in the Pennsylvania state Senate. The seat had previously been held by a Republican and it was seen as a really red district. In November, Donald Trump won it by 15 points. But Tuesday, James Malone, a Democrat, managed to flip the seat.\n\nThis is turning into a theme for Democrats. This year already, the party scored a huge upset win in Iowa. There, Democrat Mike Zimmer won a state Senate election in a district Trump carried by 21 points in November. And earlier this month, Democrats in Minnesota won a contest for a state House seat, electing Doron Clark. In that case, that district was heavily Democratic and the party expected to win there — but I don’t think they expected to win by a whopping 70 points.\n\nAll of this good news for Democrats comes as we are awaiting three very big special elections next week. In Wisconsin, there is a race that will determine control of the state’s Supreme Court — and, by extension, the future of abortion rights and voting rights in that state.\n\nIt’s technically a nonpartisan race but Elon Musk’s super PAC has poured more than $10 million into supporting the candidate favored by Republicans. Musk’s PAC is also offering voters $100 if they sign a petition against activist judges, thereby helping identify people for the party’s “get out the vote” efforts.\n\nThanks to Musk, Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race is now the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history.\n\nThere are also two special elections in Florida next week, one race to fill the congressional seat vacated by Trump’s national security adviser and group chat enthusiast, Mike Waltz, and another race to fill the seat vacated by the president’s first pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz. (The one who had to withdraw his name following lack of GOP support in light of previous allegations of illicit drug use and sex with a minor — all of which Gaetz denies.)\n\nThose are both considered heavily Republican districts. But in Waltz’s old district, Republicans are reportedly growing concerned after the Democratic candidate out-fundraised the GOP candidate by more than 10-to-1, which means that even though this is a very Republican district, Democrats are clearly putting up a fight.\n\nWatch this space.",

        "title": "How Vance's comments in the Signal scandal undermine Trump",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As he sized up a U.S. plan to strike Houthi militants in Yemen in March, Vice President JD Vance didn’t think such an aggressive move was a good idea — at least not now. The vice president’s initial comment in the Signal chat that has gotten so much attention this week was that such a strike would be “a mistake.”\n\nAmong other things, he didn’t think the American public would understand why we were doing it and worried that it might cause oil prices to spike. In that message, he wrote:\n\n3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth responded by arguing that the strike wouldn’t even be about the militants the U.S. sought to kill. Instead, it was about signaling American power to the world.\n\nThough most of the commentary about the Signal group chat this past week has focused on the accidental inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg — an outrageous breach of national security protocols — the scandal has also provided us an extraordinary window into Trump’s inner circle’s thinking about foreign policy strategy.\n\nIt underscores how farcical Trump's pledge to be president of \"peace\" and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be.\n\nWhat it reveals is a cavalier attitude toward new open-ended bombardment campaigns. And it underscores how farcical Trump’s pledge to be president of “peace” and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be. Trump didn’t need to drop bombs on scores of sites across the poorest country in the Middle East now or with such intensity — and his whole team admitted it.\n\nVance was not wholly opposed to the strikes, but saw them as a deviation from a narrow focus on American interests. In some ways, he seemed to be holding the strictest interpretation of “America First\" principles in the chat. His thinking was why attack Houthi militants if doing so wasn’t that important for the U.S. economically, but could hurt U.S. consumers and politically hurt Trump?\n\nMultiple principals in the chat pushed Vance to adopt an expansive vision of U.S. national interests.\n\nHegseth argued, “This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause.” And national security adviser Michael Waltz contended: “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.”\n\nIn a later exchange Vance says he defers to the group but that he hates the idea of “bailing Europe out again.” Hegseth replies, “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.”\n\nIn the discussion, Hegseth and Waltz represent a more traditional view of America as the world’s police officer. They’re saying this isn’t about defending the U.S. against the militants who are being targeted, and it isn’t about the U.S.’s own economic interests. Rather, it’s an intervention on behalf of U.S. allies and a pre-emptive signal to the U.S.’s nemesis in the region, Iran. It functions as a way “to send a message” about American geopolitical supremacy. It is the kind of argument that could easily be advanced by a Democratic liberal internationalist or a Republican neoconservative — both factions that some MAGA types have correctly lambasted as war hungry.\n\nWeeks after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel began its retaliation, Houthi rebels began launching missiles and drone attacks at Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, citing Israel's bombing of Gaza and stating it wouldn't stop until “Israeli aggression stops.\" The Biden administration launched airstrikes against the Houthis in 2024, but that did not stop them. Rather, the Houthis announced a pause when Israel and Hamas struck a ceasefire deal. (In the meantime, many shipping companies have taken up routes avoiding the Red Sea, and after an initial rise in the price of shipping, those companies adapted and prices came down again this year.) Now, in light of Israel’s decision to torpedo the ceasefire deal and impose a starvation blockade on the entire population of Gaza — with Trump's blessing — the Houthis had warned that they would resume missile attacks. But they hadn’t yet. Multiple Pentagon officials told Military.com that the Houthis last launched an attack in December. In other words, Trump approved a pre-emptive strike, not a protective one; as Hegseth put it, the U.S. got to \"start this on our own terms.\" The U.S. has been carrying out such attacks on a daily basis since March 15 and released few details about them, and it’s unclear when they’ll stop.\n\nThese attacks have serious consequences for the civilian population of Yemen. Yemeni officials say the strikes have hit residential areas. Indeed, in the chat discussion in the aftermath of the strikes, Waltz appears to admit that the U.S. targeted civilian infrastructure. “The first target — their top missile guy — we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed,” Waltz wrote on Signal.\n\n“Excellent,” Vance replied.\n\nThe Yemen Data Project, an independent nonprofit that monitors attacks in the country, reports that it “recorded 53 civilian casualties in 38 U.S.-led strikes from 15 to 21 March.” And according to Military.com, citing two defense officials, the Trump administration is striking a broader range of targets than President Joe Biden did and harbors “less reluctance to hold off striking targets based on the casualties that may result.” All this is all happening in a war-torn, destitute country where most of the population is food insecure.\n\nThere's reason to be doubtful that these attacks will deter the Houthis. “The group withstood seven years of Saudi-led airstrikes and a year of U.S. strikes under the Biden administration, which yielded little effect,” Luca Nevola, a senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a crisis monitoring group, told The New York Times. Given that resilience, there’s not a lot of reason to believe that Trump’s apparently open-ended campaign will in fact make a huge dent using air power alone.\n\nAmerica First, as we’re coming to see in Trump’s second term, is not fundamentally about reducing conflict in the world; nor does it reflect a serious commitment to restraint. Since news of the Signal chat broke, Democrats and liberal commentators have slammed Trump’s national security team for discussing military plans on a chat that included a journalist. They’ve laughed at the misspelling of “principals” in the group chat, and derided those officials’ hokey use of prayer emojis in anticipation of the strikes. Granted, it was an idiotic and concerning lapse in security protocol. However an important part of the story isn’t just the lapse itself, but what it teaches us about how Trump’s inner circle sees the United States’ role in the world, and how that vision is contiguous with that of previous stewards of American empire. That this seems to have largely gone unnoticed speaks to how numb Americans have become to dropping bombs in the Middle East.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s first personnel failure was the collapse of former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s attorney general nomination. That was soon followed by Chad Chronister’s failed nomination to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration and former Rep. Dave Weldon’s failed nomination to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe list is still growing — and the latest addition to the list is arguably the most dramatic. The president announced by way of his social media platform that Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York is no longer his choice to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations:\n\nAs we advance our America First Agenda, it is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress. ... With a very tight Majority, I don’t want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise’s seat. The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations. Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People.\n\nUnlike some of Trump’s other failed nominees, there was never any real doubt that Stefanik would be confirmed, probably on a bipartisan basis. Her nomination nevertheless languished as Senate Republicans scrambled to quickly approve other White House picks, for one simple reason: House GOP leaders, struggling with a tiny majority, didn’t want to lose her vote.\n\nBut with House Republicans likely to pick up two new members in Florida’s congressional special elections next week, the conventional wisdom was that Stefanik’s nomination would soon be back on track.\n\nEvidently, those assumptions were wrong.\n\nTrump’s candor was of interest. He didn’t want to “take a chance” on her congressional seat. In case this isn’t obvious, Stefanik’s congressional district, in the northeastern corner of the Empire State, is generally seen as a Republican stronghold. Indeed, Trump won the district last fall by 21 points.\n\nBut as Democrats prove that they can compete in reliably red districts, GOP officials were apparently afraid of what could happen in a special election in New York.\n\nTrump’s statement added that Stefanik will now “rejoin the House Leadership Team,” which might come as a surprise to Republican Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan, who succeeded Stefanik as the House GOP Conference chair.\n\nAs the dust settles on the news, a couple of other dimensions to the story are worth keeping in mind. The first is that Stefanik worked tirelessly throughout the 2024 election season to help Trump’s ticket, engaged in shameless sycophancy, and she was reportedly even under consideration to be his vice presidential nominee. After Trump prevailed, no one was surprised to see him offer the congresswoman an important reward that would have advanced her career considerably.\n\nAs things stand, however, Stefanik is right back where she was, effectively walking away from the process empty-handed.\n\nFinally, there’s a pattern of note: After Trump won a second term, he tapped three sitting members of the U.S. House for his team: Florida’s Gaetz, Florida’s Mike Waltz and Stefanik.\n\nGaetz’s nomination proved to be a fiasco; Waltz’s tenure as White House national security advisor really isn’t going well; and Stefanik’s U.N. nomination is no more.\n\nWhen drawing up a list of Trump’s second-term failures, don’t forget to include his personnel disasters.",

        "content": "A New York county clerk declined to enforce Texas’ civil judgment against a doctor who prescribed abortion pills to a patient via telehealth, escalating an interstate legal battle that is expected to end up before the Supreme Court.\n\nCiting New York’s shield laws, acting Ulster County Clerk Taylor Bruck informed Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Thursday that he will not file a more than $100,000 judgment against Dr. Margaret Daly Carpenter, a physician who practices in upstate New York. Any similar filings that come his way will also be rejected, Bruck added.\n\n“Since this decision is likely to result in further litigation, I must refrain from discussing specific details about the situation,” Bruck said in a statement.\n\nCarpenter was sued by Paxton’s office in December for prescribing abortion pills via telemedicine to a patient who lives near Dallas. Paxton accused Carpenter of violating Texas law by practicing medicine in the state without a local license. Last month, a Texas judge ordered Carpenter to stop prescribing abortion pills to patients in the state and issued her a more than $100,000 fine.\n\nPaxton, in a statement on X, said that he was “outraged” over the county clerk’s refusal to allow his state to enforce the judgment against Carpenter, whom he called “a radical abortionist illegally peddling dangerous drugs across state lines.” (Ample research has shown that mifepristone and misoprostol, the two pills that induce an abortion, are safe and effective.)\n\nCarpenter is also facing criminal charges in Louisiana for allegedly prescribing abortion pills to a patient in the state. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul last month rejected Louisiana’s request to extradite Carpenter, setting up another potential showdown over New York’s shield laws.\n\nCarpenter did not immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment. She has not made any public statements about either case.\n\nNew York is one of more than a dozen states with legislation to protect patients, health care providers or others who help people access reproductive care in states where it is outlawed. Texas’ case against Carpenter — as well as Louisiana’s — are likely to be scrutinized by federal courts and eventually reach the Supreme Court.",

        "title": "Elise Stefanik just learned the truth about Trump and loyalty",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Rep. Elise Stefanik gave up so much to be Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. She departed her position in the House Republican leadership. She said goodbye to much of her staff and a congressional seat that she surely would hold far longer than an ambassadorial post. She lost friendship after friendship over her unwavering loyalty to the president.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump repaid Stefanik’s loyalty as only he could: by kicking her nomination to the curb — notably, not because of anything she did, but because of his own mistakes.\n\nJoining the MAGA White House was supposed to be the culmination of a political makeover years in the making.\n\nStefanik has completely recast her public persona since 2014, when she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. In 2016, she voted for John Kasich in the Republican primary, skipped that year’s GOP convention and criticized Trump’s language on the “Access Hollywood” tape. Early in Trump’s first term, she opposed his tax cut plan and even backed Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian influence and the 2016 election.\n\nBut after the 2018 midterms, as The New York Times’ Nicholas Confessore wrote, Stefanik “embarked on one of the most brazen political transformations of the Trump era.” Perhaps the Democrats’ first impeachment of Trump “radicalized” her, as multiple aides told The Washington Post’s Ruby Cramer. Perhaps the proceedings were a convenient excuse for an ambitious politician who recognized Trump’s tightening grip on her party.\n\nWhatever the motivation, Stefanik became one of the president’s most loyal soldiers. Nothing Trump said or did was indefensible; every Democrat and media outlet was “vicious” or “radical.” The president noticed: “This young woman from upstate New York — she has become a star,” he gushed to Fox News.\n\nThe old moderate still pokes through occasionally: In late 2022, Stefanik broke with most House Republicans to back the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified protections for same-sex marriage in federal law. But, by and large, Stefanik is “ultra MAGA” and “proud of it.” Joining the MAGA White House was supposed to be the culmination of a political makeover years in the making.\n\nBut in the midst of Stefanik posting a retrospective of her congressional career on Instagram, Trump announced he was withdrawing her nomination. “It is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican seat in Congress,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “With a very tight Majority, I don’t want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise’s seat.”\n\nWhile for Trump there is no quality in a subordinate more important than loyalty, that loyalty runs only one way.\n\nThe president may have bankrupted multiple casinos, but for once he is right about the odds. In the 14 special elections held this year, former FiveThirtyEight editor G. Elliot Morris calculates that Democrats “beat Harris’s margin vs Trump with the same voters last November by 10 percentage points on average.” That swing is almost exactly the same as it was at this point in the 2018 election cycle, which ended with House Republicans being routed in the midterms. Just this week, Pennsylvania Democrats flipped a state Senate district that just five months ago went for Trump by 15 points.\n\nHouse Republicans hold only a 218-213 majority in the chamber, with four empty seats. On paper, those vacancies are evenly split: two heavily Democratic districts and two heavily Republican districts. But the GOP pair, Florida’s 1st and 6th Congressional districts, suddenly look a lot less red ahead of their special elections next week. In the latter district, which Republicans won by 30 percentage points in November, a recent internal GOP poll shows Democrat Josh Weil up 3%. As Trump himself implied in his Truth Social post, plowing ahead with Stefanik’s nomination risked losing her seat as well.\n\nThis fiasco, as is so often the case with Trump, is entirely self-inflicted. Just as in his first term, a disastrous start to his term has boosted Democratic voters’ enthusiasm for even low-turnout special elections. And whereas the Democratic-leaning vacancies came about because the representatives died while in office, Trump himself created the Florida vacancies by choosing those two representatives for his Cabinet. The first was Mike Waltz, now best known for his struggles with Signal. The second was Matt Gaetz, whose nomination as attorney general lasted just eight days.\n\nThe president tried to soften the blow by noting that Stefanik would “rejoin the House Leadership Team.” But Stefanik’s old position as Republican Conference chair was filled weeks ago, and it’s not clear how Speaker Mike Johnson could give her a position that isn’t entirely ceremonial. “I will invite her to return to the leadership table immediately,” Johnson said, without specifying what her seat would be.\n\n“She must be so disappointed,” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said of Stefanik after news broke of the withdrawn nomination. If that’s true, Stefanik isn’t showing it. “I have been proud to be a team player,” she told Fox News. “This is about stepping up as a team.”\n\nBut it is fitting that this most devoted “team player” has so little to show for her fealty. Because, while for Trump, there is no quality in a subordinate more important than loyalty, that loyalty runs only one way. Just ask Mike Pence or John Kelly or the countless other former Trump allies and staffers whom the president has callously thrown under the proverbial bus. For Trump, only his own interests matter. Everyone and everything else, whether it’s Elise Stefanik or the entire country, is expendable.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s disdain for mail-in voting has been a thorn in the GOP’s side for years. Since its use surged ahead of the 2020 election, he’s occasionally hedged before returning to the notion that the extremely secure balloting method is a gateway to fraud. In an executive order signed Tuesday, he aims to kneecap mail-in balloting around the country and make the practice as ripe for abuse as he’s claimed.\n\nThe mail-in balloting provisions in Trump’s order hinge on a fringe interpretation of a decades-old federal law establishing a uniform Election Day around the country. There are more than a dozen states that currently count ballots postmarked on or before Election Day, as long as they were received within a certain number of days. Under the reading the White House is promoting, states that count ballots received after Election Day violate the federal law, no matter when those ballots are postmarked. And under Article VI of the Constitution, federal law trumps state laws.\n\nHe aims to kneecap mail-in balloting around the country and make the practice as ripe for abuse as he’s claimed.\n\nThose states and voting rights advocates will argue that those ballots have been cast by the deadline, just haven’t been received to be counted. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled otherwise last year in a case brought by the Mississippi Republican Party and the National Republican Committee. That decision didn’t go into effect before last year’s election and is limited to federal elections, not state and local races. It has also yet to be affirmed by any other court, but the Trump administration is clearly hoping to take it nationwide.\n\nTrump’s order tasks Attorney General Pam Bondi with taking “all necessary action” to enforce the Election Day law against states that count late ballots in the tally for presidential electors and members of Congress. It also orders the Election Assistance Commission to condition the funding it provides states to help run their elections on those states no longer counting ballots received after Election Day. (There is a specific carveout in the latter provision for ballots received from “absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters.”)\n\nThe order completely subverts the principle behind setting a unitary Election Day — ensuring as many people can vote as possible — in the name of defending it.\n\nThe problems are obvious when you consider what’s really being asked of states. States that conduct their elections almost entirely via mail, such as Washington and Oregon, would have to move their current deadlines, which now allow ballots to be mailed up to Election Day. Otherwise, they would be forced to reject ballots that they consider legal. Last year, Oregon counted just more than 13,000 of those ballots appropriately postmarked and received within the seven-day window allowed under state law.\n\nThe order would also require states to rely solely on the U.S. Postal Service in returning mailed ballots. USPS’ timeliness was already a concern in 2020 when recently retired Postmaster General Louis DeJoy was at the helm. The fear then was that DeJoy would in some way stymie the delivery of blank ballots to voters or their return to election officials. Those fears never materialized, but with Trump eyeing privatizing the Post Office or merging it under the Commerce Department, it’s worth considering how an outright politicization of the mail force could affect election results.\n\nThere will most certainly be lawsuits against the order, especially some of its even more intrusive provisions that place burdens on states that Trump has no power to order. On one level, I agree with election expert Rick Hasen, who argued Wednesday that the executive order is a “dangerous power grab” that state officials from both parties should reject. There is a fundamental tension between the attempt to usurp power over elections from the states and the GOP’s professed support for “states’ rights.”\n\nThere is no tension, though, between Trump’s order and previous conservative efforts to limit the number of people who can easily vote. The order acts as a back door to enact harmful proof of citizenship requirements that will likely face a Democratic filibuster if pushed through Congress. It also actively seeks to punish states who refuse to comply with a demand for “information-sharing agreements” with the Justice Department to root out alleged voter fraud (a perennial unfounded GOP concern), which are more likely to be those states with Democratic leaders.\n\nWhen you couple in the Justice Department’s hesitancy to back Voting Rights Act cases, this order will potentially disenfranchise millions of voters from casting their ballots safely. Even outside the worst-case scenario, one in which a Trump-controlled Postal Service withholds ballots in blue states until after the deadline has passed, the pieces are all in place for Trump to totally break mail-in voting. In doing so, the order completely subverts the principle behind setting a unitary Election Day — ensuring as many people can vote as possible — in the name of defending it.",

        "title": "Trump and the GOP put a pathetic spin on the Signal scandal",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The White House, the Republican Party and their MAGA media mouthpieces think the American people are idiots.\n\nThat’s the only explanation for the Trump administration’s ludicrous, insulting, borderline Orwellian response to the revelation that top national security officials were discussing a military strike in Yemen — and revealing what was very likely classified information about it — on the Signal messaging app with the unbeknownst presence of Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic. And it’s the only explanation for Trump’s enablers in Congress and right-wing media going straight into deny-at-all-costs mode.\n\nOver the past four days, the White House’s response to the emerging scandal has followed a familiar playbook — denial, obfuscation, attacks on critics, gaslighting and whataboutism. The sad part is, considering that many of the president’s supporters will believe every word he says, combined with the cowardice of Trump’s GOP congressional allies, it’ll likely work.\n\nThe White House’s response to the emerging scandal has followed a familiar playbook — denial, obfuscation, attacks on critics, gaslighting and whataboutism.\n\nWhen Goldberg first broke the story in The Atlantic on Monday, it sent jaws to the floor across Washington and beyond. The Trump team adopted a familiar strategy — denial. In congressional hearings the next day, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe said no classified material had been discussed on the Signal chat.\n\n“Nobody was texting war plans,” said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, even though Goldberg’s article about the incident showed that Hegseth had done precisely that — and White House officials had already confirmed that his reporting was correct.\n\nHowever, as is often the case with Trump and his acolytes, they quickly shifted gears into attack mode.\n\n“You’re talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes,” Hegseth said of Goldberg. “This is a guy who peddles in garbage.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Katherine Leavitt claimed that the crux of the Signal story was not the White House’s disregard of security safeguards but rather proof that “Democrats and their propagandists in the mainstream media know how to fabricate, orchestrate and disseminate a misinformation campaign quite well. And there’s arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg.”\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz labeled Goldberg a “loser” and speculated, without evidence, that the magazine editor had snuck his way onto the group chat.\n\nOthers in the MAGA-sphere picked up Waltz’s line of attack, with Fox News’ Jesse Watters claiming that journalists like Goldberg, who he called the “lowest of the low”... “sometimes send out fake names with a contact with their cells to deceive politicians.” (In fact, there is no evidence Goldberg did anything like this, which would be an egregious breach of journalistic norms.)\n\nKeep in mind that Waltz directly added Goldberg to the group chat. If Goldberg is as awful as the White House claims, what was he doing in the chat? And if a reporter of allegedly such low character somehow snuck onto the chat, what does that say about Waltz’s decision to initiate a discussion about U.S. war plans on a third-party messaging app?\n\nFaced with the truth, the Trump team switched to its perhaps most favored tactic — gaslighting.\n\nThe drumbeat of attacks on The Atlantic and Goldberg were, in effect, daring the magazine to release the chat logs and prove they were lying … which it did on Wednesday. Those logs showed that Gabbard and Ratcliffe arguably perjured themselves and that Hegseth’s denial that he had texted out war plans was a lie.\n\nNow, faced with the truth, the Trump team switched to its perhaps most favored tactic — gaslighting.\n\nThese weren’t “war plans,” the White House huffily argued … they were “attack plans.” According to Hegseth, since there were “No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information” in his texts, they weren’t “war plans” or even “attack plans.” It was just 18 good friends getting on a group chat and shooting the breeze about a military attack. Nothing to see here.\n\nOnly in the Trump administration’s alternate universe is information about a pending military attack not classified. Moreover, Hegseth didn’t just say an attack was coming — he listed the specific times they’d be occurring and the types of weapons systems that would be used.\n\nThere is no world in which such operational plans — if they became available before an attack — wouldn’t be helpful to the enemy and potentially put U.S. fighter pilots in harm’s way.\n\nImagine, for example, if on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, U.S. intelligence officials intercepted a Japanese cable that said their planes were bombing targets in Hawaii in two hours. Would U.S. officials ignore it because, as Hegseth claims, no locations, routes, or units were identified?\n\nAnd yet, Republicans are still trying to defend this mess. According to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, “The messages The Atlantic released only prove that America is STRONG again. President Trump’s national security leaders are patriots who collaborate and then act decisively to take out terrorists. A welcomed, needed change after four years of weakness from President Biden.”\n\nNever mind that Biden, as president, ordered multiple attacks on the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nNo matter what Donald Trump does, no matter how badly his minions screw up, his supporters will always come around.\n\nThen, when all else fails, there is always the GOP’s favorite strategy — whataboutism. Asked on Thursday about whether there would be an FBI investigation of the release of classified material in the Signal scandal, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, “If you want to talk about classified information, talk about what was at Hillary Clinton’s home that she was trying to BleachBit.”\n\nOklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin took a similar tack, arguing that Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server was far worse than anything on the Signal chat. Unless Mullin has previously unknown evidence that Clinton leaked military attack plans hours before the attack commenced, this is not remotely true.\n\nOthers tried to divert calls for accountability for those involved in the unclassified group chat by pointing to the supposed lack of accountability for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during the Biden administration.\n\nChildren are frequently reminded that two wrongs don’t make a right. Apparently, that lesson has failed to penetrate the upper echelons of the Trump administration, the Republican Party, or its slavish media cheerleaders.\n\nThe sad part of all this lying, distraction and gaslighting is that it will almost certainly work.\n\nA poll today from YouGov showed that 60% of Republicans viewed the scandal as a very or somewhat serious problem, with 28% saying it’s a “very serious” problem and 16% said they weren’t sure. It’s rare these days to see that kind of disapproval of the Trump administration from Republicans, but, give it a week, and those numbers will likely come crashing back to Earth.\n\nIf there is one consistent political reality in the last 10 years, it is that no matter what Donald Trump does, no matter how badly his minions screw up, his supporters will always come around. Try to steal an election, incite an insurrection, get convicted of 34 felonies, screw up the handling of a global pandemic, share classified information on an insecure unclassified messaging app … all is eventually forgiven.\n\nAfter all, how can anyone get angry with Donald Trump? In their thinking, whatever he might have done, Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or Joe Biden almost certainly did something worse.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 26 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”\n\nWhile there is a lot of focus on the major scandals involving Donald Trump’s administration, it’s important we don’t lose sight of what’s happening inside this country, where we are witnessing the federal government snatch people right off the streets for their political speech. The latest, most chilling example of that happened Tuesday outside of Boston, when Rumeysa Ozturk, a Ph.D. student and Fulbright scholar at Tufts University, was taken off a residential street in Somerville, Massachusetts.\n\nThe masked ICE agents then lead the terrified woman to their unmarked vehicles and drive off.\n\nAt 5:15 p.m., Ozturk, who came to the United States from Turkey on a student visa, had just left her apartment when, as video obtained by NBC News shows, she was approached by a man in a dark hoodie and hat who grabbed her hands. In that video, you can see and hear how upset and scared she is. Eventually, an ICE agent finally pulls out a badge and appears to identify himself as law enforcement.\n\nOzturk is quickly surrounded by half a dozen cops, all in street clothes with their faces covered by masks. They take her cellphone and physically remove her backpack. She is then handcuffed as a bystander films and asks how anyone is supposed to know these people are law enforcement officials. The ICE agents then lead the terrified woman to their unmarked vehicles and drive off.\n\nNow, if all that were not chilling enough, an attorney for Ozturk released a statement earlier Wednesday saying in part: “We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. … No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of.”\n\nTuesday night, a district court judge ordered Ozturk not be moved out of Massachusetts “without first providing advance notice.” But late the next afternoon, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee locator, Ozturk is currently being held in a south Louisiana ICE processing center, nearly 2,000 miles from where she was snatched off the street.\n\nIn response to Ozturk’s detention, more than 1,000 people showed up in Somerville on Wednesday night to protest and call for her return.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that “investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas.” But she is still not charged with any crime. The “activities” she is accused of appear to be that she co-wrote an editorial in the Tufts University newspaper that was published a year ago.\n\nThe piece reads, in part, “We … affirm the equal dignity and humanity of all people,” specifically referencing Palestinians. It then goes on to quote the author James Baldwin and challenges the university’s president to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “embrace efforts by students to evaluate ‘diverse and sometimes contradictory ideas and opinions.’”\n\nIn response to Ozturk’s detention, more than 1,000 people showed up in Somerville on Wednesday night to protest and call for her return.\n\nOzturk is not charged with a crime because, as far as we know, she did not commit one. She is here legally on a visa. And while the government does have the discretion to terminate a visa, is this how America does that now — by snatching terrified students off the street and taking them thousands of miles across the country without anyone knowing?\n\nThat is as flatly authoritarian as anything we have ever seen in the United States.",

Kennedy Jr.\n\nUtah’s law goes into effect May 7.\n\nKennedy has linked fluoride to various health maladies, despite U.S. scientists and public health groups supporting the mineral’s use, and has said the Trump administration would advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy bemoaned that he’s been labeled a conspiracy theorist for linking fluoride to low IQ levels, but the data he references has been criticized by experts. As NBC News reported:\n\nA report published recently in JAMA Pediatrics found a statistically significant association between higher fluoride exposure and lower children’s IQ scores — but the researchers did not suggest that fluoride should be removed from drinking water. According to the report’s authors, most of the 74 studies they reviewed were low-quality and done in countries other than the United States, such as China, where fluoride levels tend to be much higher, the researchers noted. An Australian study published last year found no link between early childhood exposure to fluoride and negative cognitive neurodevelopment. Researchers actually found a slightly higher IQ in kids who consistently drank fluoridated water. The levels in Australia are consistent with U.S. recommendations.\n\nScientists and major medical associations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have touted the benefits of fluoride in water for decades, particularly for children, to help prevent tooth decay and reducing cavities.\n\nUtah’s anti-fluoridation law is what happens when the MAGA movement’s anti-science efforts spur official policy.",

Salvadoran officials have said those serving time in CECOT will never leave the facility.\n\nWith virtually no due process, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of Venezuelan migrants it claims are part of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador, where they are incarcerated at CECOT.\n\nIn the video, Noem warned that the administration would continue to send migrants to CECOT, calling the facility “one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.”\n\nMultiple families have said their Venezuelan relatives deported to El Salvador have no criminal records or gang affiliations, and that the administration has not provided evidence of their alleged gang membership.\n\nNoem’s video, which has been widely criticized, follows a pattern of her using immigration enforcement activities as photo ops, often with a full face of makeup and her hair blown out. True to form, in a subsequent post on X Thursday morning, Noem shared a series of glossy photos of herself touring the Salvadoran prison.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "We have three branches of government because we don’t trust one, or even two, to do the people’s work when it comes to a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Our government’s system of checks and balances is based on the idea that the dispersal of power protects the public, and that absolute power may, as the saying goes, corrupt absolutely.\n\nThe judicial branch in particular stands as a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority. When the legislative and executive branches, meant to represent the majority, overreach and threaten to trample on our individual rights, it is incumbent upon judges to step in and rebuff those attempts. Think, for instance, about a federal law that says it is illegal to burn an American flag in public. Even if Congress passes this law and the president signs it — as happened in 1968 — it violates our individual right to freedom of speech. This is the moment we need judges to step in and vindicate those rights by declaring that law invalid. Otherwise, our rights can be squashed with little recourse.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long cautioned Congress against using funding decisions to attempt to influence judicial decision-making.\n\nThis week, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson floated the idea of hobbling our lower federal courts and hence undermining our delicate system of checks and balances. He made these comments, not coincidentally, amid numerous decisions by federal judges to, at least temporarily, halt certain actions by the Trump administration. The administration’s efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport foreign nationals, to end birthright citizenship, to fire federal workers and to put a halt to certain federal spending have all run into judicial roadblocks, at least partially or temporarily halting the administration’s plans.\n\nJohnson told reporters: “We do have the authority over the federal courts, as you know. We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts and all these other things.” Johnson is largely correct: The Constitution established only the Supreme Court and left it to the legislative branch to create lower federal courts. Congress does control the purse strings and could attempt to defund federal courts, though it cannot cut the pay of federal judges while they are in office. And Article III judges, meaning judges nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can only be removed via the impeachment process.\n\nBut if Johnson and other Republicans attempted to follow through on this idea, it would erode the ability of the judicial branch to serve as a true check on the legislative and executive branches. The Supreme Court has long cautioned Congress against using funding decisions to attempt to influence judicial decision-making. Johnson’s proposal could be but one step on the way to a more authoritarian style of governance.\n\nEven short of abolishing certain lower federal courts, which Congress has done in the past, lawmakers can do plenty to hobble the work of the judiciary. Many federal judges have significant caseloads, and any cut to the funding of the federal court system could hamper their ability to function and send a chill through the judicial system. Congress could also strip lower federal courts of jurisdiction to hear certain types of cases. This process, called jurisdiction stripping, removes a swath of cases from a federal judge’s purview. Congress could, for instance, prevent lower federal courts from weighing in on disputes involving the Voting Rights Act.\n\nNone of this means that federal judges should operate in an unchecked vacuum. First, if a judge abuses their power, impeachment is the mechanism to use to remove that judge. But as Chief Justice John Roberts reminded us recently, impeachment is not a remedy for disagreement with a judicial decision. Second, if Congress disagrees with a court’s interpretation of a piece of legislation, it can pass new legislation. Third, if lawmakers believe that courts are misinterpreting the Constitution, they can amend the Constitution. That is an arduous and rare process, but it is an available remedy to check the judicial branch.\n\nWhile authoritarian regimes thrive on weak judicial systems, strong democracies thrive on robust ones.\n\nJohnson later tried to downplay his comments as merely an observation about congressional authority. But even if Johnson ultimately drops all such proposals, his initial threat alone was pernicious. The mere suggestion that Congress could retaliate against a co-equal branch could make judges think twice before issuing decisions against the interest of the legislative branch. It is not unreasonable to hear Johnson’s comments and think that one party is attempting to control one of the last backstops against many of President Donald Trump’s attempts to enlarge the power of the executive branch.\n\nWhen members of the political branches disagree with federal judicial decisions, the solution is to attempt to pass or repeal legislation through a deliberative process, not to attempt to erase the power of the federal judiciary. While authoritarian regimes thrive on weak judicial systems, strong democracies thrive on robust ones. To protect democracy, we must protect the main safeguard of democracy: a strong judicial branch. Gutting the judicial branch will gut its ability to protect the public from majoritarian overreach.",

The Justice Department’s independence has been an important modern value in the post-Watergate era. But it’s an understatement to say that the current administration is testing that value.\n\nOf course, the department isn’t entirely unrelated to the president. It’s not a coincidence that DOJ priorities can shift every four or eight years. In every administration, the president appoints DOJ officials — some of whom are subject to Senate confirmation — whose views are at least somewhat aligned with the president’s or else they wouldn’t be picked.\n\nBut the alignment between the DOJ and this White House is extreme. The lawyers leading the department are Trump’s personal attorneys from his criminal and impeachment cases; they now wield the awesome power of the federal government on his behalf. As Attorney General Pam Bondi put it: DOJ lawyers are “his lawyers.”\n\nOne of the greatest independence tests is when presidents themselves face potential legal jeopardy. We have several data points on this subject over the years, including from Trump’s first term. But look even more recently to when Joe Biden was investigated related to classified documents. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed a special counsel (a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney) for the matter. Announcing that appointment, Garland said it “underscores for the public the Department’s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters, and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law.”\n\nWould Bondi do the same? The answer to that question is the same answer to the question of who this DOJ serves.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me? I’d love to hear from you!

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin has been having a rough go at things since President Donald Trump picked the former lawyer for Jan. 6 defendants — who on the day of the attack tweeted that he was at the Capitol and relayed the “love, faith and joy” at the scene — to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C.\n\nI wrote last month about Martin’s rage over media leaks apparently coming from staffers in his office. And this week, he received fierce backlash during an appearance in one of the Blackest communities in D.C.\n\nThe Washingtonian magazine published a dispatch from Martin’s trip to Anacostia, a neighborhood that is nearly 90% Black, for a discussion with local leaders about crime. On its face, this appearance seemed ripe for controversy, given that Martin is a staunch supporter of the insurrectionists who waged a Ku Klux Klan-style attack on the Capitol, with gallows and all.\n\nAnd apparently, Martin’s disconnect from attendees was glaringly obvious. According to the Washingtonian, he made an attempt to drive a wedge between Anacostia residents and Africans who have benefited from foreign aid. And it didn’t go over well.\n\nPer the Washingtonian:\n\nClearly a back-slapping, friendly person by nature, he began his appearance with a somewhat conciliatory tone, telling the crowd “you’re the experts on what’s happening in the community,” and name-dropping the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site as commemorating “one of the great historic folks.” But he struggled to keep it relatable. By a few minutes in, he brought up the embattled USAID in what he clearly thought was a slam dunk: “When USAID sent hundreds of millions of dollars to central Africa, didn’t you ask, ‘why didn’t you send it to 7D? (the Seventh District),” he asked. There was an immediate and resounding “no” from the crowd. “You didn’t?,” Martin scoffed. “Well you should. I did.”\n\nThis was a pretty disgusting attempt by Martin to sow division by invoking U.S. Agency for International Development cuts, which are inhibiting everything from HIV treatment to maternal health care in Africa.\n\nMartin appeared to be taking tips from his boss here: President Donald Trump peddled this same kind of “foreigners are taking your money” schlock, particularly to Black audiences, during last year’s campaign. And the Washingtonian noted that Martin was called out on this by Cora Masters Barry, the widow of former Washington Mayor Marion Barry:\n\nA few minutes later, Cora Masters Barry, Marion Barry’s widow, took issue, giving Martin the most severe dressing down of the day. “You need to learn your politics,” she said. “You need to learn geography, and world affairs. There’s a whole different pot of money that goes to Africa that stops diseases…. You don’t know what you talking about, so be careful about what you say when you go places, because you show that you’re not well read.”\n\nOuch. She basically called Martin an ignoramus to his face. And Barry didn’t stop there:\n\nBarry also pointed out that Martin, in his focus on crime, ignored the fact that DC had already made progress. “You haven’t once mentioned Metropolitan [Police Department],” she said. “You haven’t talked about the chief of police, who’s doing a great job of bringing crime down. So you can’t sit there and talk about what you gonna do as if something’s not being done already. What you do is you walk in and you say: ‘what’s being done and how can I help?’”\n\nShe reportedly received applause when she advised Martin to “be careful how you talk to us.”\n\nThis seems to have been a pretty disastrous showing by Martin, whose MAGA messaging clearly goes over well with hardcore Trump supporters — and far less so with residents of Anacostia. At least those residents appear to see him more as an occupying force in D.C., which Trump has said he wants to “take over,” than a helpful partner to its communities.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "When you’re using the Signal app, you can set your chats to automatically disappear after a few days.\n\nThe Donald Trump administration is hoping that a scandal over top officials’ use of Signal to discuss impending military plans will similarly disappear, as so many other controversies already have.\n\nIt brought to mind the old World War II posters admonishing GIs against sharing information on troop movements: “Loose lips sink ships.”\n\nIt’s up to Democrats and responsible Republicans in Congress to make sure that doesn’t happen.\n\nThis is no ordinary offense. The conduct here raises questions about the handling of America’s secrets, the safety of our troops and the accuracy of our public records.\n\nAnd the Trump administration has already shown that it can’t be trusted to police this matter itself, while a Republican call for the Defense Department’s inspector general to investigate is insufficient. Only Congress can do this job.\n\nThe scandal came to light when The Atlantic’s editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging service Signal, where he was privy to messages from Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, national security adviser Michael Waltz and a host of others — all discussing with alarming detail planned strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nIt brought to mind the old World War II posters admonishing GIs against sharing information on troop movements: “Loose lips sink ships.” But these weren’t privates getting overly chatty in a bar; these were some of the highest officials in the government deciding on the plans and sharing details of the timing and location on a commercially available app.\n\nMake no mistake: It is only due to Goldberg’s integrity and sheer dumb luck that this recklessness didn’t result in dead Americans, yet the Trump administration is repeatedly making the conscious choice to lie to the American people, downplaying the shocking ineptitude these messages reveal.\n\nFrom the White House briefing room, press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the text messages — which included specific strike times and weapons systems — did not contain classified information but was rather a “sensationalized story.” Hegseth promised that no one was texting “war plans,” a claim that’s hard to reconcile with what Hegseth wrote in the chat: “THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP.” Waltz even shockingly suggested — without a shred of evidence — that Goldberg somehow surreptitiously infiltrated the chat.\n\nFor his part, Trump claimed not to know anything about the story before resorting to his cliched attacks on the press, calling it a “witch hunt.”\n\nIt’s clear this administration is hoping the colossal failure blows over and Americans move on. We — as a nation — cannot allow that to happen. Now is not the time for lawmakers to sit idly by. Every member of Congress who’s ever claimed to care about the lives of American service members needs to step in and exercise the body’s power as a co-equal branch of government.\n\nThis goes far beyond a group chat, an encrypted app, or even a single military strike. This is about the very machinery of national security — how this administration makes decisions that can ripple across the globe in an instant.\n\nAt stake is whether our allies continue to trust us with their most sensitive intelligence. Whether an enemy spots a covert operation before it’s complete. Whether a soldier makes it home to see their child grow up.\n\nThis isn’t just about policy. It’s about life and death, trust and betrayal, and the fragile line between order and chaos.\n\nThe the administration cannot be trusted to investigate itself.\n\nIt must be Congress that leads an investigation because the uncomfortable truth is this: The administration cannot be trusted to investigate itself.\n\nOn Wednesday, Leavitt claimed that billionaire Elon Musk’s team would look into how Goldberg ended up in that explosive chat. Let’s be clear: That’s not oversight, that’s gaslighting. We know how Goldberg was added — Waltz brought him in. The receipts are right there in black and white in the texts published by The Atlantic.\n\nSo ask yourself: Why would a tech billionaire with no jurisdiction and plenty of conflicts of interest be tasked with uncovering the truth? Why not the FBI? Why not the Department of Justice? Why not anyone with actual authority and accountability?\n\nEspecially when Musk’s own office, the Department of Government Efficiency, is already under scrutiny for attempting to access sensitive government information. This isn’t just a distraction; it’s a smoke screen.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker has called on the Department of Defense’s inspector general to probe the scandal, but that won’t work either. Acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins has “acting” in front of his title because Trump fired his predecessor. He’s in no position to hold the administration’s feet to the fire.\n\nOnly Congress can actively pursue a full-scale investigation to answer the questions raised by this scandal. It is up to the public to demand real accountability from their representatives.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Symone Sanders-Townsend, Michael Steele and Alicia Menendez, watch “The Weekend” every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Blurring the distinction between substance and process is a tactic of disinformation. The Trump administration is using the technique in its efforts to deport immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, but the courts are seeing through it.\n\nOn Wednesday, an appeals court upheld an order to block President Donald Trump’s administration from using the 1798 statute to deport people it says are members of a violent Venezuelan gang known as Tren De Aragua.\n\nThe administration knows that most Americans support the removal of transnational criminal members of a gang it recently designated a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThe substance of Trump’s policy has broad appeal. The administration knows that most Americans support the removal of transnational criminal members of a gang it recently designated a foreign terrorist organization. And Trump frequently invokes his strong “mandate” to engage in aggressive immigration enforcement, which was a major theme of his campaign.\n\nWhen district court Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportations on March 15, Attorney General Pam Bondi blasted the judge for “supporting the Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans.” In fact, Judge Boasberg is not “supporting” either party. He is supporting the law. The legal problem isn’t with what the administration is doing; it is how the administration is doing it.\n\nIn a 2-1 decision Wednesday, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also ruled against the administration, rejecting an emergency motion to overturn District Court Boasberg’s decision to stop the program temporarily. Two judges, one appointed by a Republican president and one by a Democrat, wrote concurring opinions noting problems with the application of the statute and the apparent denial of due process.\n\nIn her concurring opinion, Judge Karen L. Henderson explained that the Alien Enemies Act applies only in wartime. At the moment, of course, the United States is not at war. As Judge Henderson wrote, the Alien Enemies Act was enacted during a time when “our fledging nation was consumed with fear” of a war with France and “internal strife from her sympathizers.” As a result, Congress passed a package of bills known as the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act would permit the president to expel “enemies” during times of war. The problem with using that statute now, of course, is that none of those conditions are currently being met. A counterpart to the statute known as the Alien Friends Act was passed for use in times of peace. That statute permitted the removal of any immigrant the president deemed “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.” Why, you might ask, did the Trump administration not simply use the Alien Friends Act to deport this group? That’s because, as the court noted, the statute was immediately seen as unconstitutional and allowed to lapse in 1800.\n\nBut that’s where the how becomes a problem. As Judge Henderson explained, the language of the Alien Enemies Act requires a “declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government” or “an invasion or predatory incursion ... against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation of government.” Happily, we are not at war, which, under the Constitution, may be declared only by Congress. Nor have we experienced any “invasion” or “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation or government.\n\nDespite the government’s argument that unwanted migrants who cross the border unlawfully have “invaded” our country, the court said that those terms as used in the statute instead must be considered in their “military sense.” Indeed, the court noted that James Madison had called the statute “an exercise of the power of war.” The court concluded that the words “invasion” and “predatory incursion” in the statute must be read to mean a “hostile encroachment by a nation state.” Because these conditions do not exist, the plaintiffs in this case have shown a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their lawsuit against the administration.\n\nIn another concurring opinion, Judge Patricia Millet explained her concerns with how the administration is deporting the plaintiffs, noting the apparent denial of due process.\n\nIn another concurring opinion, Judge Patricia Millet explained her concerns with how the administration is deporting the plaintiffs, noting the apparent denial of due process. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees due process to anyone within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States before they can be denied life, liberty or property. Courts have long held that due process rights apply to immigrants, legal or not, in deportation proceedings. The basic requirements of due process are fair notice, an opportunity to be heard and an impartial decision-maker. The individuals in this case received none of these procedural safeguards to determine whether they are, in fact, noncitizens who are members of Tren de Aragua. The judge noted that some of the men were designated as gang members based on tattoos matching those found in a Google search.\n\nThe case now goes back to Judge Boasberg’s courtroom for further proceedings, including the court’s order that the government show that it did not violate his initial order to halt the departure of planes and their return, as well as its refusal to answer his questions about those issues.\n\nThe Trump administration no doubt handpicked members of a transnational criminal gang to test the waters for aggressive immigration enforcement, gambling that most members of the public would be happy to see them go.

        "content": "President Donald Trump coined a bizarre new nickname for himself during a speech at a White House event on Wednesday to commemorate Women’s History Month: “the fertilization president.”\n\nWhile touting efforts to expand in vitro fertilization, Trump said there will be “tremendous goodies in the bag for women” including what he called “the fertilization and all the other things we’re talking about.”\n\n“Fertilization,” he said as the crowd laughed, “I’m still very proud of it, I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president and that’s OK.”\n\n“That’s not bad,” Trump went on, adding that he had been called “much worse” than the nickname he seemed to have just made up on the spot. “Actually, I like it, right?”\n\nTrump otherwise hit familiar notes in his speech at the event. He bragged about women’s support for him in the 2024 election, attacked transgender people and hailed his executive order to abolish the Education Department.\n\nBut his remarks about “fertilization” follow a record of awkward and patronizing remarks he has made while trying to make a case for himself to women. During the 2024 campaign, Trump dubbed himself the “father of IVF” as he tried to win over female voters by promising to have the government pay for fertility treatments — even as he admitted that he’d never heard of the procedure prior to a controversial Alabama Supreme Court decision to recognize frozen embryos as legal persons. Trump also vowed to be a “protector” of women — whom he said were abandoned, scared and in danger — “whether the women like it or not,” echoing the disturbing rhetoric of pickup artists, as my colleague Ja’han Jones pointed out at the time.",

        "content": "The accountability office also estimated this month that $162 billion in improper payments — which includes but is not limited to fraud — from 16 federal agencies that reported data. Medicare and Medicaid were, by far, the largest sources, totaling some $85 billion in improper payments. The vast majority of those improper payments occurred because of insufficient documentation or billing that did not demonstrate sufficient medical necessity, according to both the accountability office and inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services. Neither watchdog agency mentioned the misuse of Social Security numbers.\n\nFederal agencies and watchdog organizations have long recognized that Social Security number misuse and identity theft are serious issues. But credible estimates of fraud committed using fake or stolen Social Security numbers do not come close to half a trillion dollars annually or 10 percent of expenditures, as Mr. Musk asserted.\n\nA review of a random sample of identity verification transactions for government programs in 2024 by TransUnion, a major credit bureau, found that 2 percent of transactions involved a Social Security number previously used for a death benefit, 0.4 percent involved a number with an unusual number of inquiries for a short time span and 0.1 percent involved an identity flagged as a high synthetic identity risk, according to Greg Schlichter, the director of research and consulting for TransUnion’s public services sector.\n\nThis amounts to “fraud risk exposure of hundreds of millions of dollars for some programs,” Mr. Schlichter said, adding that entitlement programs were more susceptible to fraud and government agencies could institute more robust fraud detection without sacrificing access to benefits.\n\nA February report from the Social Security Administration’s inspector general’s office found that the agency issued $32.8 billion in overpayments from the 2020 to 2023 fiscal year, including $13.6 billion from the main Social Security program and $19.2 billion from the supplemental program for some older, blind and disabled people. About 4 percent of overpayments in the main program were issued after death and 3 percent for those who obtained benefits fraudulently or were not American citizens. (Certain immigrants, such as lawfully admitted permanent residents, are eligible for some Social Security benefits, but the agency stops those payments if the immigrant lives abroad for more than six months.)",

She said that her old boss, Mr. Trump, “knows how to read the polls. He knows that Biden left as the least popular sitting president in decades.” She said he must continually “remind everybody what he’s inherited.”\n\nMs. Conway was referring to immigration issues and U.S. involvement in wars abroad, among other things. But not everything that Mr. Biden left behind for Mr. Trump was all bad. He also inherited a booming stock market and the world’s strongest post-Covid economy.\n\nAnd yet, Mr. Trump has made Mr. Biden into a political boogeyman so epic and omnipresent that it is impossible to ignore. His use of the name is most commonly followed by a verb: “Biden fudged the numbers … Biden canceled it … Biden let them get away with murder … Biden’s done nothing … Biden left him up there … Biden allowed it to get out of hand … Biden left us a mess … Biden said the wrong things … Biden gave away money like it was water … Biden set us up in Venezuela … Biden allowed China to go crazy … Biden ended it … Biden really screwed up our country.”\n\n“I think presidents think this way all the time and privately they have conversations about it,” said Julian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton who edited a book of essays about Mr. Trump’s first term. “They don’t tend to say it all the time in public, and they don’t tend to focus on the person, as opposed to the agenda they found problematic.”",

The shaking was felt in southern China and Vietnam and as far away as Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, where a 30-story skyscraper under construction collapsed, killing at least seven people.\n\nDetails of casualties and damage in Myanmar, which has been ravaged by a four-year-long civil war, were not immediately clear.

        "content": "Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government.\n\n“We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”\n\nMyanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority.\n\nWestern sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it.\n\nMichael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue.\n\nThere is also a risk that the military prevent aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added.\n\nAnd, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said.\n\nWhen a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, little international aid reached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas.\n\nIn Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world.\n\nStefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas.\n\n“The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”\n\nAnother issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said.\n\nDr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

First, people were awakened at night by a loud rumbling. Dawn broke to reveal its source: a long, narrow ridge of jagged ice that had mysteriously arisen across the lake’s surface, meandering like the spiked back of a twisting dragon.\n\nThis was the Miwatari, meaning the sacred crossing, which local belief held was left by a passing god of Japan’s native Shinto belief. Its appearance evoked feelings of awe but also reassurance among the residents, who ventured onto the ice to perform a ceremony honoring what they saw as a visitation from the supernatural. In the rare winters when the ice ridge did not appear, the god’s absence was viewed as a warning that the natural world was out of balance.",

        "content": "Fact Check\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire leading a government efficiency initiative, has for weeks made broad and unsupported claims of rampant fraud in federal spending.\n\nIn a series of interviews on conservative podcasts and television interviews, Mr. Musk has defended attempts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to target popular entitlement programs like Social Security and access sensitive payment systems with a series of inaccurate claims. A representative for DOGE did not respond when asked for evidence of Mr. Musk’s claims.\n\nHere’s a fact-check.\n\nWHAT WAS SAID\n\nVideo\n\nThis lacks evidence. Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for most federal safety net benefits, and there is no evidence to suggest they are committing fraud en masse to obtain them. In fact, a number of independent and government analyses suggest that the opposite is true: Unauthorized immigrants pay more into Social Security and Medicare than they receive in federal benefits.\n\nFederal law bars unauthorized immigrants from receiving Social Security or Medicare benefits, as well as most other federal government assistance programs, but they do pay taxes. (Immigrants, including those who those received asylum, refugee or humanitarian parole status, may be eligible for more programs.)\n\nIn a 2013 report, the Social Security Administration estimated that 3.1 million unauthorized immigrants were working and paying Social Security taxes, contributing about $12 billion to the trust in 2010 and about $100 billion over a decade. A 2016 study estimated that unauthorized immigrants contributed about $35.1 billion to Medicare from 2000 to 2011.\n\nA 2024 study from the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank, found that unauthorized immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022, including $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes and $6.4 billion Medicare taxes.\n\nAnd the Congressional Budget Office estimated last summer that the surge in immigration from the 2021 to 2026 period would actually decrease the federal deficit by $0.9 trillion over a decade. The budget office projected that those recent migrants and their children will receive $0.3 trillion in federal benefits, but they will more than offset those costs by bolstering tax revenues by $1.2 trillion. (The $0.3 trillion, too, was an estimate of benefits these immigrants legally qualify for, not fraud.)\n\nThere is no evidence of mass entitlement fraud perpetrated by unauthorized immigrants. A 2018 report from the Niskanen Center, a libertarian-leaning think tank, noted that since 2011, there were fewer than 100 annual prosecutions of unauthorized immigrants where fraud was the leading charge.\n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, which supports reducing immigration, has said that unauthorized immigrants “unambiguously” benefit Social Security and Medicare, but legalizing their status would harm both programs. The group has also argued that one group legally receiving some benefits — immigrants fleeing troubled nations granted humanitarian parole, a temporary legal status — would “for all intents and purposes be illegal aliens, were it not for the abusive parole practices of the Biden administration.” This is a critique of policy choices though, not an accusation of entitlement fraud.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\nVideo\n\nThis is misleading. Mr. Musk repeatedly misrepresented the findings of that 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe watchdog agency projected that the federal government lost between $233 billion and $521 billion annually to detected and undetected fraud during the 2018 to 2022 fiscal years. The estimate also was governmentwide, and not limited to fraud in entitlement programs or fraud committed using false Social Security numbers. The report gave several other examples of fraud like falsifying invoices, trafficking benefits and overbilling.\n\nIt was unclear whether Mr. Musk was arguing that the report was issued under the Biden administration or if all the fraud occurred under the Biden administration, but the time covered in the report included about three years under the Trump administration and over a year and a half under the Biden administration.\n\nThe accountability office also estimated this month that $162 billion in improper payments — which includes but is not limited to fraud — from 16 federal agencies that reported data. Medicare and Medicaid were, by far, the largest sources, totaling some $85 billion in improper payments. The vast majority of those improper payments occurred because of insufficient documentation or billing that did not demonstrate sufficient medical necessity, according to both the accountability office and inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services. Neither watchdog agency mentioned the misuse of Social Security numbers.\n\nFederal agencies and watchdog organizations have long recognized that Social Security number misuse and identity theft are serious issues. But credible estimates of fraud committed using fake or stolen Social Security numbers do not come close to half a trillion dollars annually or 10 percent of expenditures, as Mr. Musk asserted.\n\nA review of a random sample of identity verification transactions for government programs in 2024 by TransUnion, a major credit bureau, found that 2 percent of transactions involved a Social Security number previously used for a death benefit, 0.4 percent involved a number with an unusual number of inquiries for a short time span and 0.1 percent involved an identity flagged as a high synthetic identity risk, according to Greg Schlichter, the director of research and consulting for TransUnion’s public services sector.\n\nThis amounts to “fraud risk exposure of hundreds of millions of dollars for some programs,” Mr. Schlichter said, adding that entitlement programs were more susceptible to fraud and government agencies could institute more robust fraud detection without sacrificing access to benefits.\n\nA February report from the Social Security Administration’s inspector general’s office found that the agency issued $32.8 billion in overpayments from the 2020 to 2023 fiscal year, including $13.6 billion from the main Social Security program and $19.2 billion from the supplemental program for some older, blind and disabled people. About 4 percent of overpayments in the main program were issued after death and 3 percent for those who obtained benefits fraudulently or were not American citizens. (Certain immigrants, such as lawfully admitted permanent residents, are eligible for some Social Security benefits, but the agency stops those payments if the immigrant lives abroad for more than six months.)\n\nAnd separately the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, a panel of inspectors general, estimated in 2023 that nearly 70,000 questionable Social Security numbers were used to obtain stimulus benefits totaling more than $5.4 billion.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\nVideo\n\nThis is misleading. A federal judge in New York in late February barred members of the DOGE team from regaining access to the sensitive payment systems operated by the Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, but Mr. Musk continues to criticize one of those systems.\n\nThe Payment Automation Manager, or PAM, is a payment processing system developed over a decade ago to streamline payments across the government and standardize fiscal data to provide better transparency. It issues checks and deposits for the vast majority of federal payments including Social Security benefits and tax refunds. PAM processed over $4.7 trillion in payments in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nGovernment watchdogs have found issues with payment traceability across the federal government, and specific ledger lines in PAM may not include the level of detail Mr. Musk is requesting. But he is wrong that those payments amount to “untraceable blank checks” and Mr. Musk has provided no evidence that omitting those details has caused $100 billion annually in improper payments.\n\nContrary to Mr. Musk’s claims, PAM requires agencies to submit payment data in a standard format and include a “Treasury Account Symbol” and “Business Event Type Code,” which identify an individual appropriation or fund account.\n\nIn fact, DOGE and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service used TAS codes to identify foreign aid payments for the State Department to review and halt under Mr. Trump’s broad funding freeze, according to a February sworn statement from Tom Krause, a software executive recently appointed as an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department.\n\nMr. Krause, an ally of Mr. Musk’s, also said that many Type B payments — which he described as “lower value, higher volumes” ones — processed in PAM are missing TAS codes. Mr. Krause noted that this has hampered the accuracy of the Treasury Department’s bookkeeping. (The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for more detail.)\n\nType B payments are made in bulk, and details are provided for the entire batch, not for individual payments, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, in annual audits, has identified “significant” deficiencies in how the government keeps track of these payments. Some federal agencies submit identification codes at a summary level, record transactions without the codes in their own ledgers, or revise data after submitting — all of which make it difficult for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to track individual payments across different government ledgers.\n\nThere has been progress in improving governmentwide traceability of individual payments, the accountability office said in its latest report, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has said it hoped to enact a uniform way of recording payments by the 2029 fiscal year, but would need the cooperation of other agencies to do so.\n\nNeither the Government Accountability Office nor Mr. Krause has estimated that lack of reporting detail in PAM leads to $100 billion annually in improper payments.\n\nNathan Tankus, an expert on payment systems who has reported extensively on the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, questioned Mr. Musk’s figure. “The only way to get to $100 billion is to facilitate impoundment” and give PAM the power to stop congressionally appropriated payments, he said.\n\n“But that’s not the purpose of the system,” Mr. Tankus said. “We want it to process payments as long as they’re valid payments authorized by Congress, just like we want our bank to process our payments at the local grocery story without going, ‘Huh? Why are you spending $200 at the grocery store? What about $150 instead?’”\n\nWhat Was Said\n\nVideo\n\nThis lacks evidence. Later in the interview, another member of the DOGE team specified that Mr. Musk was referring to $830 million in spending identified in conjunction with the Interior Department. This appears to have been a reference to the purported dissolution of a directorate in the Interior Department, not just one 10-question survey.\n\nIn a social media post this month, DOGE wrote that the Interior Department was dissolving its Federal Consulting Group, a little-known directorate that since 1987 has provided and procured consulting, executive coaching and survey services for other agencies. According to the post, the group had brokered a $75 million contract to design satisfaction surveys, and DOGE said it had canceled $830 million in unsigned “similar contracts” to be awarded by the group.\n\nBut there is no single contract for one 10-question web survey worth $75 million, let alone $830 million or $1 billion listed in DOGE’s own list of terminated contracts as of Monday.\n\nThe largest contracts for surveys altered or canceled on DOGE’s website were a Labor Department contract to survey agricultural workers (potential value of $32 million), a Department of Veterans Affairs contract for customer service surveys of medical disability exams (value of up to $20 million) and another Veterans Affairs contract for a patient satisfaction survey (value up to $16 million).\n\nThe DOGE database, which has repeatedly included numerous errors, lists about $442 million worth of Interior Department contracts, with savings of about $144 million. That includes about $7 million worth of surveys with savings of about $400,000, the largest of which was a $2 million contract to help the Agriculture Department conduct surveys about food stamps.\n\nPublic government spending databases show about $87 million of contracts with award language referring to the Federal Consulting Group since the 2010 fiscal year. It is possible that the group was involved in other contracts canceled by DOGE but was not cited in award language. For example, the group works with a private company to administer surveys tracking satisfaction with federal services across a number of agencies. That company has received about $4 million to $5 million annually in contracts.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government.\n\n“We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”\n\nMyanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority.\n\nWestern sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it.\n\nMichael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue.\n\nThere is also a risk that the military prevent aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added.\n\nAnd, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said.\n\nWhen a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, little international aid reached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas.\n\nIn Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world.\n\nStefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas.\n\n“The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”\n\nAnother issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said.\n\nDr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

        "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "President Trump intensified his push to impose a more positive view of American history by moving to curb the independence of the Smithsonian Institution, which he wants to make into a “symbol of inspiration and American greatness.”\n\nIn an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” Mr. Trump took aim at what he described as a “revisionist movement” across the country that “seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” His order claimed that the Smithsonian, in particular, had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and that it promotes “narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”\n\nMr. Trump does not directly control the Smithsonian, which is governed by a Board of Regents, which includes a mixture of Democrats and Republicans, and is overseen by Congress. In the order he called on Vice President JD Vance, who is a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to work with Congress to prohibit expenditures on exhibitions or programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law.” His executive order also called for making sure that the Smithsonian’s American Women’s History Museum, which is under development, does not “recognize men as women in any respect.”\n\nThe Smithsonian, which has 21 museums, libraries, research centers and the National Zoo, appeared to be caught off-guard by the order. When contacted by a reporter shortly after it was released on Thursday evening, several leaders said they were just learning about the new order themselves. The announcement recalled Mr. Trump’s takeover of the Kennedy Center last month, when he purged Biden appointees from the formerly bipartisan board and installed himself as its chairman.",

        "content": "UCLA and Ole Miss started the season together in Paris, with the Bruins facing Louisville and the Rebels taking on USC. Now, they’ll be on the court together as one team ends the other’s 2024-25 campaign.\n\nOle Miss plays aggressive defense, forcing turnovers on more than a quarter of opposing possessions. The Rebels are physical on offense, attacking the paint and the glass and getting to the foul line more than 20 times per game.\n\nThey win the possession game and take about 12 more field-goal attempts than their opponents. Even as Baylor had a good shooting night in the second round (45.8 percent from the field), Ole Miss edged out the Bears on their home court because of seven extra offensive rebounds and 10 more free-throw attempts.\n\nThe problem for the Rebels is that UCLA is bigger and more physical. The Bruins dominate the offensive boards with Lauren Betts and forwards Janiah Barker and Gabriela Jaquez crashing for second chances.\n\nThey’re fourth in paint points per game, which they supplement with consistent shooting from beyond the arc (four players shoot at least 35 percent on 3-pointers). Richmond coach Aaron Roussell noted that the Spiders were prepared for what UCLA could do inside, but it was once the Bruins started raining 3s that their second-round game got out of hand.\n\nThe battle to watch inside is between Betts and Ole Miss center Christeen Iwuala, who spent her first two seasons at UCLA. Iwuala knows Betts’ tendencies as well as anyone, but if she could hang with her former teammate, she’d probably still be a Bruin. Furthermore, Iwuala’s presence on the Rebels means the UCLA coaching staff has been locked in on Ole Miss game tape all season.\n\n“We’ve tuned in as a team to a lot of games, starting with in Paris at the very beginning of the year,” UCLA coach Cori Close said. “In fact, (in) our staff meetings all the time, (assistant coach Tasha) Brown will say, ‘Well, if we were Ole Miss, we would be defending like this, this and this’; if I had a dollar for every time she said that. We are going to have to get our act together for the Sweet 16 game. But we’ve been preparing all the way.”\n\nThe bet is that Betts wins her matchup with UCLA’s perimeter players giving her just enough of a boost from long range for the Bruins to make their first Elite Eight since 2018.\n\nPick: UCLA",

Photograph: Danielle/Guardian Community\n\nI found it shocking, to be honest. You always hear about TV shows being absolutely heartbreaking but this is one of the first to actually leave me wanting to cry, but not knowing how. Shows always try to capture what teenagers are like, but they never get it as accurately as Adolescence has. I could relate to some of the scenes, but Jamie and Eddie Miller really had an impact on me. Their struggles with anger are ones I’ve witnessed from people I’ve known. It was triggering because it was so accurate. I have a son who I adore and you never know what a child’s future is going to be like. You want the best for them. To raise them to succeed and be great, kind people. I don’t know how I’d feel if he did something like Jamie [did]. Danielle, 20, Oxfordshire\n\n‘Society is constantly belittling and putting down young men’\n\nThe larger issue is society constantly belittling and putting down young men (particularly young white men). Yes, Andrew Tate and ideas which degrade women are obviously bad, and young men do get exposed to it all sometimes. But they have been conditioned to feel guilty for who they are and this causes a crisis of identity, which can lead some men to embrace the extreme ideas of someone like Tate.\n\nMen don’t want to be told they are “toxic”. By constantly putting men down, society is driving young men to be influenced by people such as Tate, as they see no approval from anywhere in their life. Justin, 22, self-employed, Melbourne\n\n‘Not being on social media until senior year of high school was the best decision’\n\n‘Seeing the real-life effects of social media was chilling”’ … Calden. Photograph: Calden/Guardian Community\n\nIt was chilling to see a real-life look into the effects of social media and cyberbullying on my generation and the next. My parents didn’t give me an iPhone until 8th grade (when children are about 13 years old) and I didn’t get social media until senior year of high school (about 17 years old) – that was the best decision they ever made. I was bullied as a kid and I can only imagine the impact it would’ve had on me if I had been on social media at the same time. Calden, 21, student, Boston, Massachusetts\n\n‘I couldn’t take it seriously after the emoji conversation’\n\nThe technical achievement and harrowing performances should be applauded, but at times I felt I could really tell that this programme was not written in consultation with the age group of the main character. The emoji conversation in episode two totally ruined my immersion in the show, and I found the rest of the programme difficult to take as seriously. Yes, young people do use emojis to communicate in code (as do adults!), but I have not come across a single person, internet result or Urban Dictionary post explaining that the “100” and “kidney bean” emojis might have a nefarious double meaning. Anna, 25, student, London\n\n‘It was a wake-up call to oblivious parents and teachers’\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘It painted a harrowing reality’ … Anika. Photograph: Anika/Guardian Community\n\nI think Adolescence painted the harrowing reality of today’s online world. I see people idolising Andrew Tate, spewing misogynistic rhetoric, and passing it off as a joke. The idea of victimising young boys, the “incels”, takes away their agency and pins the blame on “choosey” females. Even in my old school, the guys would comment on girls’ bodies, their intellect, and shame them, laugh at them and belittle them. The worst part was that they never realised the wrongness of their actions. But I don’t hate them. I grew up with these people; they are good people, but I pity them. They are young teens like us girls, and I hate that they have been subjected to such nonsense under the guise of truth. I think the show was a wake-up call to oblivious parents and teachers, and I hope it paves the way for real change. *Anika, 18, student, midwestern US\n\n‘I could have been radicalised by Jamie’\n\nI’ve been out of school for years now, but the issue is still the same. I nearly became an incel. I was a prime candidate: chubby, sensitive, a learning disability and the child of a particularly ugly divorce I was old enough to process. I could have been radicalised by Jamie. I recognised some of my old classmates in the show – all of them diagnosed with serious mental health issues, all of them medicated and with appropriate levels of care. It’s been heartening to see the incel issue finally be acknowledged by the government; the glaring omission of discussion around Jamie’s quite clear emotional and mental disorders, however, is extremely concerning. I worry that by blaming the violence exclusively on inceldom we risk reducing the violence to just another “culture war” topic, a political football to make arguments with. *Dan, 27, Kent\n\n‘Young people need to feel seen – they need us to acknowledge their pain’\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘We shouldn’t shame this behaviour – we should understand it’ … Olivia. Photograph: Olivia/Guardian Community\n\nAfter watching the show, I found myself reflecting on what the character, Jamie, really needed. It became clear that his pain wasn’t about being the most attractive or popular – it was about not feeling enough, not feeling seen. Young people don’t always need an adult to tell them what is wrong with social media or what to be afraid of. They already know that. What they need is for us to acknowledge the pain they’re carrying, whether it’s from a friend betraying them, or from the crushing feeling that no one is paying attention to them. They need to know that their feelings are valid, and that it’s OK to hurt. We shouldn’t shame the behaviour that comes from these feelings; we should understand it, and work with it. Olivia, 21, works for a youth organisation, Bentleigh, Melbourne\n\n‘I’ve seen it first-hand – my ex-boyfriend got into Andrew Tate’\n\nI’ve seen it first-hand with boys falling down this pipeline, unfortunately – it’s scary how much someone can change because of it. I remember noticing it with my ex-boyfriend. We were both 16 at the time, and he and his friends started getting into Andrew Tate and spouting really toxic views. Within a few weeks we had broken up because he had started losing basic respect for me, while his friends started speaking about women as simply a hole and not much more. Around the same time, a friend of mine was getting death threats after she rejected a boy (who was known to be in the incel community at the time). Luckily, nothing ever came of it, but I remember her not bothering to go to our teachers since she thought they wouldn’t do anything, as he was perceived as a “good, misunderstood kid”. *Lydia, 19, sales assistant, Essex\n\n‘The lack of voice or perspective from the victims seemed a strange omission’\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘The pressure on girls from misogyny should have been investigated’ … Joseph.

The tone felt confused – even though the writers said that the show is not meant to be a whodunnit, episode two was still framed as one as it revolved around the search for the murder weapon. For this reason, it didn’t work at all for me. I think the show would have been much better if the tone was more consistent, and Jamie’s misogyny and how it led to violence had been explored further.

Then his career changed in a very strange way. Bamba fought 14 times in 2024 and won all 14 of those fights by knockout. On 21 December 2024 he was credited with defeating Rogelio Medina Luna in a fight for the World Boxing Association ‘gold’ cruiserweight championship when Medina quit on his stool after the sixth round.\n\nBamba was living his dream. But the dream appears to have been a fantasy built in significant measure on fixed fights.\n\nSix days after fighting Medina, Bamba was dead.\n\nMore than two dozen people have been interviewed for this story. Some of them asked that they not be mentioned by name out of concern that it could damage professional relationships. Others had no such reservations. The cautionary tale of Paul Bamba follows.\n\nBamba was born in Puerto Rico on 15 August 1989. His early years were mired in horrible deprivation that – he later told friends and posted on social media – led to his being taken from a crack-addicted mother when he was four years old. He never knew his biological father. He was moved from foster home to foster home before enlisting in the US Marines at the age of 17. He served in Iraq, left the military when his tour of duty ended, and, at 19, reunited with a man named Ismael Bamba who had befriended him when they were stationed together in San Diego.\n\nIsmael Bamba is a career military officer, now a sergeant-major in the Marines stationed in South Korea. He and his first wife are from Ivory Coast. They separated in 2006 when their daughter, Linda, was nine. Linda joined the military in 2019 and is now a paralegal with the Judge Advocate General division (Jag) of the US Air Force. She will enter law school this fall and return to Jag as an attorney when her studies are done.\n\n“My dad took Paul under his wing when Paul got out of the service,” Linda says. “Then he remarried and Paul moved in with us in San Diego. It was the first time Paul had ever been in a cohesive family unit. He was valued and had a home. That meant a lot to him.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Paul Bamba survived a tough upbringing to build a life for himself. Photograph: Alevtina\n\nIsmael Bamba had 17 brothers and sisters. “Paul was the only light-skinned one in the family,” Linda says. “But everyone took to him. He was the family favorite. Later, my dad had a son with his second wife. So there was Paul, myself, and our little brother. My dad encouraged Paul to go into therapy to deal with the things he suffered as a child. He and my father spent a lot of time together. He looked up to my dad. He wanted to be like him. He took our last name. He even had ‘Bamba’ tattooed on his body. He said he was half-Puerto Rican and half-Ivorian. Then my father got orders to go to Hawaii and Paul moved to New York. Later on, he liked to say he’d been homeless in New York. He wasn’t homeless; not really. There was a time when he was broke and struggling to pay the rent. He might have been without a place to live now and then. But he wasn’t homeless the way you think of it.\n\n“Paul was a protector. When I joined the military, he was always texting me. ‘You good? Do you need anything?’ He was a ladies man. He liked women, but he liked a lot of women. Women would say, ‘He’s my man.’ No, not from Paul’s point of view, they weren’t. He was getting to a point where he wanted to settle down and have a family. But he wasn’t quite there yet.”\n\nThen Linda echoes what friend after friend says was one of Bamba’s defining characteristics.\n\n“Paul was the most hard-headed individual I ever met. He was driven, stubborn, prideful,” she says. “Because of his childhood, he always felt that had to prove himself and prove people wrong when they looked down on him. He had big dreams and was passionate about what he did. He’d been to hell and back and was planning on traveling further. He would stop at nothing to be successful.”\n\nThe people who knew Bamba best describe him as having a big personality and a big heart. People liked him. He had a charming way about him.\n\n“Paul was my friend,” says Thomas LaManna, a fellow fighter and boxing promoter. “He was a great dude. But Paul was Paul. He had a lot of dreams. And he was a stubborn motherfucker. He’d listen to you and then go out and do exactly what he wanted to do.”\n\nGardea Christian was Bamba’s best friend and later his business partner. Like Bamba, he had served in the Marines. They met after their time in the service and were loyal to each other.\n\n“Paul was an inspiration for a lot of people,” Christian says. “He was determined. He had a drive to get things done. I’m very protective of Paul and his legacy.”\n\nJason Harris co-founded a creative agency called Mekanism that specializes in brand development. In 2018, he helped Bamba and Christian launch a health and fitness business called Trifecta Strong.\n\n“I advised them,” Harris says. “I created the logo. We got some investors. We were going to open a gym, but Covid happened and we pivoted to a Trifecta app. Then we ran out of money for marketing and advertising, and the business became personal training. Paul had some high-profile clients [including R&B singer and songwriter Ne-Yo] that kept things going. But he still wanted to open a gym.”\n\nMultiple friends and associates recount the setting for what came next.\n\nPaul craved attention … Paul needed money to open a gym … Paul was driven to prove himself … Paul wanted street cred … Paul wanted people to admire him … Paul saw boxing as his way of getting everything he wanted. Boxing would be his stairway to the next level. He had this scenario in his mind and he was going to play it out regardless of what happened.\n\nWhen Jake Paul brought social-media influencer boxing into the mainstream, Bamba took note. It was a wave that he thought he could ride to bigger and better things.\n\n“[Bamba] began talking about boxing as a means to an end,” Harris says. “He saw what Jake Paul was doing. And his plan was to become an influencer boxer, get well-known, and make big money so he could get the business rolling and open a gym.”\n\nAnd there was another motivation.\n\n“[Bamba] really wanted to be famous,” Harris says.\n\nBut there was a problem. Bamba didn’t have the physical gifts necessary to be a quality fighter.\n\n“There’s an epidemic in boxing,” matchmaker Eric Bottjer says. “And it’s very dangerous. A fighter with extremely limited ability is backed financially, either by himself or someone else. He uses social media to build an image. He fights. A lot of commissions look the other way or don’t even understand what’s going on. But the fighter can get badly hurt.”\n\nA trainer who worked with Bamba sums up his talent. “Paul wasn’t very good and never would be,” the trainer says. “He just wasn’t gifted physically like you have to be to be even an average amateur boxer. He was never gonna win an amateur tournament in New York, not even a novice one. He had a handful of amateur fights. I remember, in one of them, he got knocked out ugly, face first, unconscious.”\n\nA longtime cornerman agrees that Bamba was a limited boxer. “I never worked with Paul but I saw him a lot around the gym,” the cornerman says. “He was outgoing, always respectful. He had a lot of heart, a lot of grit. But some people, you introduce them to boxing and they take right to it. I used to watch Paul sparring. Even after he’d been boxing for a while, he was very novice.”\n\nBamba moved from trainer to trainer. In 2021, he turned pro and hired Sarah Fina, who works for Dave McWater, one of boxing’s best managers, to book fights for him.\n\n“I liked Paul as a person,” Fina says. “I thought he was a good guy. And he was marketable. But a real boxer? No. Realistically, his lane was the YouTube world. I told him that. I was always real with him. We never had any official paperwork but he wanted my name on [boxing website] BoxRec as his manager. I took it off at one point and he pleaded with me to put it back on.”\n\nOn 21 April 2023, Bamba fought Chris Avila in New Orleans and suffered a bad beating en route to a 40-34, 40-35, 40-35 defeat. That was the last fight Fina made for him. As 2023 drew to a close, he was a club fighter with a 5-3 professional record.\n\nChris Avila v Paul Bamba\n\nPutting those numbers in further perspective; the three fighters Bamba had lost to had a composite ring record of three wins against nine losses at the time he fought them. Looking at the fighters he did beat; three of them now have a composite ring record of 0 wins against 19 losses. The fourth has a 2-13 record. And the fifth has won one of his last 17 fights.\n\nBamba was fighting as well as he could. But he wasn’t good enough to succeed even as a club fighter. So he opted for a new strategy.\n\nAnd “the knockout streak” began.\n\nIt’s a common (and legal) practice in boxing for managers to “buy” bouts on fight cards for young prospects. The manager reimburses the promoter for the purse paid to both his fighter and the opponent. Other fight-related expenses, such as travel, are also reimbursed. The opponent is overmatched and has little chance of winning. But the opponent does try to win and occasionally pulls off an upset.\n\nThere are also instances where a fighter is matched against a “professional loser”.\n\n“This is how it works,” Jason Nesbitt, who finished his career with 10 wins, 197 losses, and four draws, told writer Mark Turley. “Before we go out there, I get a quiet word in my ear. ‘Jase, you’ve got to take it easy. This lad’s sold six grand worth of tickets, so we can’t have him losing. If you go out there and knock him out, I promise you, you’re not getting any more fights.’ I’m not actually trying to win because I’m told not to. And that’s basically what I do to earn my money in boxing. It’s my weekly wage, so I’m going to do what I need to do to keep it coming.”\n\nBamba was neither young nor a prospect. He had begun his career with “real” fights. Then, to fuel his dreams, he moved to questionable ones.\n\nBamba’s first 11 “knockout victories” in 2024 took place in Latin America, eight of them in Colombia.\n\nBoxRec is the closest thing to an official record-keeper the sport has. John Sheppard created and oversees the website. He does his best to maintain the integrity of the site. But “integrity” and boxing don’t always go hand in hand.\n\nSheppard says that, from 2018 through 2020, there were roughly a dozen fights a year in Colombia that involved a boxer from the United States. In 2024, that number had risen to 278. And according to reports submitted to BoxRec, the American fighter won all 278 of those bouts. These numbers speak for themselves. Sheppard calls the practice “win tourism”.\n\n“Win tourism is the same business model wherever you find it and there’s complicity at every level of the sport,” Sheppard says. “We’re record-keepers. We’re not Interpol. We try to keep accurate records but we can’t police every boxing match around the world. A few years ago, we started cracking down on some of the results coming out of Mexico. We were successful to the extent that the number of reported fights involving an American against a non-American in Mexico was cut in half and the win percentage for the non-American fighter doubled. But it’s hard to make progress. Some people who work at commissions look the other way or worse. And some are scared. Two Mexican commissioners who were working with us had funeral wreaths delivered to their homes.”\n\n“Some people make good money from it,” Sheppard continues. “Most of it probably goes to the promoters. The so-called opponent gets something. Sometimes they put one fighter in the ring and use another fighter’s name for a fee. Sometimes they don’t even have the fight and just report a win for a particular fighter.”\n\nBamba’s knockout streak began in Santa Marta, Colombia, in January 2024, with two reported fights in less than a week. On three occasions in 2024, he was listed as having fought twice in Colombia within a span of six days or less.\n\n“As far as I know,” Fina says, “Paul booked all the fights he had last year himself. I had nothing to do with them.”\n\nChristian supports Fina’s version of events, saying, “Paul represented himself in negotiating his fights. He had contacts with promoters. I didn’t go to his international fights but I dealt with a lot of the logistics like setting up the travel.”\n\nChristian also says that an average trip to Colombia cost about $5,000 all inclusive and that he helped finance the trips through the business he ran with Bamba. Asked whether the fights were fixed, he answers: “Paul got in the ring with fighters. There were crowds. He hit and got hit.” Pressed for more detail, Christian says, “I’ve seen guys fight and it looked to me like a guy wasn’t fighting. I never had any doubts about Paul’s opponents.”\n\nBut others have a different view.\n\nView image in fullscreen Paul Bamba trained hard but was viewed as a limited fighter. Photograph: Sean O’Neill\n\n“From what I heard,” says a trainer who worked with Bamba, “in a lot of those fights, Paul knew the other guy was coming to lose and would quit on his stool.”\n\nSomeone who was on site for one of Bamba’s fights in Colombia says, “Paul knocked his guy out. And I remember thinking: ‘No way.’”\n\nA cornerman who worked with one of Bamba’s opponents gives further context, saying, “Some guys aren’t fighting to win. They’re fighting to feed their families. They don’t care about their record. They need the money. Put yourself in that position. People don’t like to talk about it. They pretend it’s not happening. But it is. Bamba wasn’t much better the year he won all those fights than he was the year before. But it was like building a house. If you have the money to pay for it, you can build the house any way you want.”\n\nDid Bamba know that some of his fights were fixed? Three people who knew and liked him offer their thoughts.\n\n“Paul was a fighter. When a fighter is in the ring, he knows whether or not someone is trying to hurt him.”\n\n“I’m sure that some of the guys Paul fought were so unskilled or so far gone that they had no chance of winning. But some of the others would have beaten him in an honest fight. And it’s hard to believe that Paul was so delusional that he thought all of the guys he was fighting were trying to win.”\n\n“Of course he knew. Someone had to set things up.”\n\nOn 19 October 2024, Bamba fought in the United States for the first time since his knockout streak began. The opponent was Francisco Cordero (listed on BoxRec as born and living in Colombia). The fight took place in New Hampshire, a state with minimal regulatory oversight for boxing. Bamba was required to submit the results of bloodwork taken within the previous six months (to check for hepatitis), an eye examination and an EKG (both taken within the previous year), and to undergo a cursory physical examination before the fight. He knocked Cordero out in the third round.\n\nMichael Reyes was the promoter for Bamba v Cordero.\n\n“It was a paid-for fight,” Reyes says. “Bamba’s team got in touch with me and paid for everything. Travel, lodging, the opponent’s purse. They chose the opponent. There was a slot fee to get on the card. Typically, I get $500 for that. The only reason he was on the card is that it was a paid-for fight. He wasn’t selling any tickets. No one was traveling to New Hampshire to watch him fight. The contract said his purse was $1.”\n\n“He seemed like a nice guy,” Reyes continues. “He was polite. Our interaction was pretty much, ‘Hello. How are you? Thanks for coming.’ There was nothing else one way or the other that I remember about him. When it’s my event, I’m so busy that, unless it’s a fighter who’s directly connected to me, I might not even watch the fight. I don’t remember watching this one.”\n\nTwo weeks later, Bamba fought again; this time in Alabama, another state with minimal regulatory oversight. The opponent was Colombian-born Santander Silgado Gelez who lives in Florida. Bamba was credited with a sixth-round stoppage.\n\n“Paul was introduced to me by a promoter in Mississippi who was a friend of a friend of a guy who promoted with me,” says Dexter Sutton, who promoted the fight. “Paul wanted to buy a spot on the card and we sold him the spot for $300. Paul did all the arrangements for the opponent and took care of all the expenses. All we had to do was make sure the fighters got their bloodwork and everything was OK with the commission. Alabama isn’t as strict as some other places with the physicals.”\n\nSutton continues: “I thought Paul was a nice guy. He had somebody with him that worked his corner. We had the normal conversation. ‘How was your trip? Welcome to our promotion.’ The opponent fought pretty much like he came for a payday. It looked like Paul carried him for a few more rounds than it could have been. Then the other guy just quit. Later on, I heard Paul died and I wanted to send flowers to his funeral. But when I contacted the people who put him in touch with me, they never got back with where to send the flowers.”\n\nThere’s no indication that Reyes or Sutton did anything improper. They were following the laws of the states in which they did business.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s no way to know how many of Bamba’s final 14 fights were honestly fought. But statistics and the available video suggest that a significant number of them weren’t. That brings the narrative to Bamba’s final fight on 21 December 2024, in Carteret, New Jersey against Rogelio “Porky” Medina Luna.\n\nMedina is a 36-year-old journeyman who entered the ring for his fight against Bamba with a 42-10 record that included 36 knockouts. There was a time long ago when he was a prospect with 23 wins in 23 fights. In recent years, he has been a stepping stone for big-name fighters such as Gilberto Ramírez, David Benavidez, Badou Jack, James DeGale and Caleb Plant. The prevailing view among boxing insiders was that Bamba was nowhere near Medina’s level as a fighter.\n\nBamba v Medina was designated as a fight for the World Boxing Association ‘gold’ cruiserweight championship. The WBA isn’t known for the validity of its championship processes. At present, it recognizes 43-year-old Kubrat Pulev as “heavyweight champion of the world” – a distinction that Pulev earned last December when he defeated 40-year-old Manuel Charr, who underwent double hip replacement surgery in 2017.\n\n“Thomas LaManna set it up with us,” says Alex Barbosa, who promoted Bamba v Medina. “Thomas also worked things out with the WBA. We didn’t have to pay Paul. Paul and Thomas paid Rogelio’s purse and all of the other expenses associated with the fight. That’s standard practice these days. And Paul was super nice. We never had any problem with him. He was a good guy.”\n\nLaManna explains more. “Paul wanted to do his thing,” he says. “It was pretty simple to put together. The sanctioning fee we paid the WBA for the gold belt was $25,000. That was the big expense. You had Medina’s purse, some travel and other expenses. Paul had financial backers and sponsors who covered most of it. He sold some tickets. It was a common boxing deal structured so Alex wouldn’t lose any money on it.”\n\nOn 12 November 2024, Bamba posted on X: “12/21/24 I’ll take on my biggest challenge and fight for the opportunity to live my dream.” On 15 December he posted again: “6 days till my 14th fight this year. WBA GOLD Cruiserweight World Title. I have sacrificed this entire year and have given everything I have to boxing.”\n\nBamba v Medina was a dreary outing. At the end of round six, Medina told his corner to stop the fight, saying that he had leg cramps.\n\nA veteran trainer who was at the fight says, “Paul got hit with some big punches. I remember his head snapping back a lot. But each time Porky hit him, he backed off and didn’t press the action. And then Porky quit on his stool. From where I sat, it looked like, if Porky came to fight, it would have been a different story.”\n\n“I was there,” says another boxing veteran. “And if you knew what you were watching – to me, at least – it didn’t add up. The whole fight didn’t seem right.”\n\nLaManna worked Bamba’s corner that night. “Paul’s regular trainer couldn’t make it,” LaManna says, “so someone else was the chief second and I helped out. I thought Paul would do better than he did in the early part of the fight. But as it went on, Porky faded.”\n\n“How good a fighter was Paul?” LaManna is asked.\n\n“We could all be better,” he says.\n\n“There was nothing crazy in the fight,” Barbosa adds. “Paul didn’t take any ‘Oh my God’ punches that I saw. I wasn’t surprised when Rogelio stayed on his stool. You can see it in a fighter’s face when he doesn’t want to continue.”\n\nThen Barbosa is asked the same question as LaManna: How good a fighter was Paul?\n\n“You’re as good as your record says you are,” Barbosa answers. “And Paul’s record was pretty good.”\n\nBamba v Medina is available on YouTube. Readers can watch it and make their own judgment as to the merits of the fight.\n\nPaul Bamba vs Rogelio Medina\n\nIn the dressing room after the fight, Bamba was ecstatic. “If Jake Paul wants to take boxing seriously,” he proclaimed, “I’m probably the first call he’s going to make. If he wants to do something real, I’m right here.”\n\n“That was the goal,” Christian says. “Almost from the start, getting a fight against Jake Paul was the goal of everything,”\n\nIf Bamba v Jake Paul had happened, it would have been an ugly beatdown. Jake Paul has become a solid club fighter; Bamba wasn’t close to that level. But fantasies aren’t bound by the same rules as reality.\n\n“Tonight I accomplished a goal I set out with this year,” Bamba posted on X after the Medina fight. “14 fights 14 KOs. Thank you to everyone who’s been behind me. Truly grateful for anyone who’s breathed belief into me. The redemption arc is finally over and big things are on the horizon for 2025. THANK YOU ALL!”\n\nOn 22 December, Bamba posted again on X: “Possibly will be fighting on New Year’s Eve in Dubai. Might be able to hit 15. Huge announcement coming.”\n\nIt wasn’t to be.\n\nSix days later, the news spread from friend to friend: Bamba had died in his sleep.\n\nThere was an autopsy. No official statement regarding the cause of Bamba’s death has been released. The most common belief among his friends is that he died as the result of a brain bleed. But whatever the cause, Bamba is dead. And his friends are sifting through their memories.\n\n“I went to Paul’s last fight,” Fina says. “And it was the same story as most of his fights. It was competitive, which it shouldn’t have been. Paul took a lot of unnecessary punishment. He texted me after the fight. It was the last text I ever got from him.”\n\nBamba’s text to Fina read, You still think I suck, don’t you?\n\nPaul Bamba died in his sleep on 27 December 2024, at the age of 35. There were clear signs before then that his health was in jeopardy.\n\nThere’s no good way to get hit. And Bamba got hit a lot. He was hit in the gym. He was hit in fights even when there was an understanding that he would win. For a while, he was a paid-by-the-round sparring partner. They take a beating.\n\n“I told him to slow down,” Fina says. “He never took a break. He never gave himself time to heal. He was fighting way too much and taking much too much punishment. But Paul did what he wanted to do. There was no saying ‘no’ to him.”\n\nThe most troubling documentary evidence relating to Bamba’s medical condition is a 25 July 2023 letter written by a neurologist, Dr Alina Sharinn. Bamba’s last fight prior to the letter being written was his 21 April 2023 beatdown at the hands of Chris Avila. He was scheduled to fight Anthony Taylor in Tennessee on 22 July but the fight was cancelled. Then Paul posted Sharinn’s letter on social media.\n\nThe letter read in part, “Mr Bamba has suffered a concussion and an episode of traumatic diplopia [double vision] within the past year and now presents with increasing headaches. His MRI of the brain revealed white matter changes in both frontal lobes. At this time, I discussed with Mr Bamba to stop boxing temporarily as well as to avoid any other activity that can produce head trauma. He will be reevaluated in 4-6 weeks.”\n\nWhy did Bamba post the letter? Who knows.\n\nThen, in a 28 July video post on X, Bamba declared: “The first thing we’re gonna go over is the medical itself. She said she wanted to take a second look. She said there’s signs of early onset trauma. Is there anything I want to tell her. So as soon as she said ‘early onset trauma,’ I was like ‘trauma?’ And she said ‘brain trauma’. So I said ‘Oh!’ That freaked me out. I can’t lie. I have a bunch of twitchin’. I got headaches. It was scary to hear it. It’s brain trauma, bro. It’s a lot different from just some bullshit. I’m not gonna get too deep into my health. But there’s a few things that are alarming.”\n\nNitin Sethi is a neurologist and the medical director for the New York State Athletic Commission.\n\n“A lot of people have white matter changes,” Sethi explains. “It’s most common in older people and can result from hypertension, diabetes; there are many possible causes. But this was not an older person and it’s certainly possible that the changes were related to boxing. So what you have to do is compare MRIs over time, look at the differentials, and then decide whether to say, ‘That’s it. No more. We won’t license you to fight.’ At the very least, it’s a red flag.”\n\nDr Margaret Goodman, also a neurologist, founded the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) to combat the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs in boxing and is one of the foremost advocates for fighter safety in the United States.\n\n“I agree with Nitin,” Goodman says. “Based on this letter and the fighter’s history, it certainly looks as though the fighter was at increased risk of serious injury and shouldn’t have been allowed to fight again without a serious medical review.”\n\nBut there was no serious medical review because Bamba brought his career to jurisdictions where there was little if any regulatory oversight. He fought next in Colombia on 25 January 2024, which was when his 14-fight knockout streak began.\n\nThe details around Bamba’s final fight, held in New Jersey, are particularly troubling.\n\n“Before that fight,” one of Bamba’s friends says, “he was complaining to me about headaches. He said: ‘My head is killing me.’ I told him: ‘Look, if your head is hurting, slow down. Get checked out.’ But he wouldn’t listen to anybody. He did what he wanted to do.”\n\nThe New Jersey State Athletic Control Board (NJSACB) is thought of as having high medical standards.\n\n“A lot of people have questions about how Paul got approved for that fight,” a well-respected trainer says.\n\nLarry Hazzard, the commissioner of the NJSACB, declined comment when asked about Bamba. Instead, a public information officer for the New Jersey Attorney General’s office told the Guardian that “Mr Bamba fulfilled both the license and medical requirements and was granted clearance to compete in Carteret on 21 December 2024.”\n\nIn that regard, matchmaker Eric Bottjer, who keeps an eye on these things as part of his job, says, “There was a show in New Jersey earlier this year where phoney medicals were submitted to the commission for three fighters [two bloodwork and one MRI]. It’s being looked at now.”\n\nAfter Bamba’s final victory, his publicity machine went into overdrive, claiming that his 14 knockouts in 2024 had broken Mike Tyson’s mark for most consecutive knockout wins in a calendar year. Even if all of Bamba’s wins had been legitimate – which they weren’t – that claim would have been inaccurate. Mike Tyson had 15 fights in 1985 and won all of them by knockout. But we live in an age in which, if something is repeated often enough, it’s accepted as true no matter how false it might be. Many of the obituaries written about Bamba in mainstream publications cited his “knockout record”.\n\nBamba’s friends speak of him with fondness.\n\n“He was determined to make something of himself,” Harris says. “He was passionate about chasing the impossible. He was determined to achieve what he considered success. He was relentless. That caught up with him in the end. But he will always be a motivating force in my life and the lives of many, many others.”\n\nBut there was a downside to what Bamba did. He deserves respect for what he accomplished as a 5-3 club fighter who got in the ring and fought as honestly as he could. The fixed fights he had after that – and some of them were fixed – tarnished his legacy. There were times when he punched other men in the head and tried to hurt them with the understanding that they would not try to hurt him back. Some of those men – who were human punching bags – are likely to have suffered brain damage too.\n\nFighters also have to take responsibility for their own physical wellbeing. And Bamba didn’t do that. He recklessly put his own life at risk.\n\nBamba’s sister, Linda, puts his life in perspective.\n\n“To the very end,” Linda says, “Paul would ask our dad, ‘Are you proud of me?’ But we were all proud of Paul for getting to where he was in life before boxing. Boxing was about how Paul felt about himself. Nobody who loved him would have loved him less without those fights. I didn’t go to his fights. It scared me. I didn’t want to watch him get hit. Before the last fight, I knew he was hurting. His head hurt really bad. But it was, ‘Let me just get this win. Let me just win this championship.’ It wasn’t till after we got the postmortems that I understood how bad things were. Someone should have said, ‘Slow down. This isn’t normal. This is dangerous. Your life comes first. You don’t have to keep doing this. We love you and we’re proud of you with or without boxing.’ I wish I’d asked more questions about what was really going on. It sucks that Paul’s life was cut short. It really sucks.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The US vice-president, JD Vance, and his wife Usha are due to touch down in Greenland on Friday in a drastically scaled down trip after the original plans for the unsolicited visit prompted an international diplomatic row.\n\nThe visit to Pituffik, a remote ice-locked US military base in northwestern Greenland, will be closely watched by leaders in Nuuk and Copenhagen, who have aired their opposition to the trip amid ongoing threats by Donald Trump to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“It’s safe to say we would rather not have him [Vance] in Greenland,” a government source in Copenhagen said.\n\nBefore the Vances’ arrival, Trump said the US will “go as far as we have to go” to gain control of the island which he claimed the US “needs” for national and international security.\n\nThe mood in Copenhagen was understood to be apprehensive. On Thursday, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, responded to Trump’s comments, saying: “Greenland is part of the Danish kingdom. That is not going to change.”\n\nShe added: “We in the kingdom would really like to work together with the Americans on defence and security. We want that in Ukraine, we want that in Europe, and of course we also want that when it comes to the high north. But Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.”\n\nMeanwhile Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s minister for foreign affairs, said Vance would not be greeted by Danish politicians at Pituffik because “it has nothing to do with us”.\n\n“This is about an American vice-president who is going to visit his own military installation in Greenland. It has nothing to do with us,” he said.\n\n1:55 'It’s cold as shit': US vice-president arrives in Greenland – video\n\nThe Vance visit comes as political parties in Greenland are about to sign a coalition agreement in Nuuk on Friday in a show of unity after elections earlier this month. Greenlandic media reported four of the five parties in parliament – all except Naleraq – will go into a coalition led by Jens Frederik Nielsen of the Democrats who won 30% of the vote.\n\nThe delegation, originally to be led by the second lady, Usha Vance, was scheduled to visit the capital Nuuk and Sisimiut, for a dog sled race. Bulletproof cars had already been delivered to Nuuk in preparation.\n\nBut after strong comments from Múte B Egede, the prime minister of Greenland, and Frederiksen, the White House switched to a single stop at Pituffik.\n\nAnnouncing he would be joining his wife on the trip to Greenland, the vice-president said in a video: “Speaking for President Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it’s important to protect the security of the entire world.”\n\nThe White House has shared few details of what is planned, but it is expected to be a “traditional” troop visit.\n\nThe Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said that Trump’s statements were “far out” and “a hidden threat”.\n\n“It is not fair for the American president to use that rhetoric,” he told Danish broadcaster TV2. “You are going too far both in terms of interfering in internal affairs in Greenland and not least in the lack of respect for the fact that it is the people of Greenland who determine Greenland’s future.”\n\nPele Broberg, the Naleraq leader, which came second in the election but left coalition negotiations earlier this week, said the diplomatic disagreements over the US visit were a missed opportunity.\n\n“I consider this an extreme example of failed diplomacy by Greenlandic politicians,” he said. “I don’t think anybody is doubting that this is a missed opportunity.”\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, Vladimir Putin told an Arctic forum in Murmansk on Thursday that he considered US plans to acquire Greenland as “serious”. “We are talking about serious plans on the American side with regard to Greenland,” he said. “These plans have longstanding historical roots.”",

        "title": "Russian scientist working at Harvard detained by Ice at Boston airport",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "A Russian scientist from Harvard Medical School has been detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to her friends and colleagues.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cora Anderson, who works with the Russian scientist Kseniia Petrova, shared the news of Petrova’s detention on Facebook, saying the Russian scientist arrived at Boston Logan international airport on 16 February from a trip to France when she was stopped by US authorities.\n\nAccording to Anderson, authorities revoked Petrova’s visa and told her that she was to be deported to Russia. In response, Petrova said that she feared political persecution and was instead sent by authorities to a detention facility, Anderson said.\n\n“We had no idea initially what had happened to her since she was unable to send any messages or make any calls upon detention. She was moved to a facility in Vermont at first and then Louisiana where she is now. Where she is now is a jail that has space rented by ICE and is kept in a room with over 80 other female detainees,” Anderson wrote in her Facebook post.\n\n“Despite having lawyers and the fact she did not do anything illegal in the first place, she is still there, and we have no idea when she will be paroled (or released, however simply released is unlikely),” she added.\n\nPetrova’s boss, Leon Peshkin, said in an interview on Thursday that the researcher had good reason to fear being returned to Russia because she had publicly protested the Russian invasion of Ukraine in its first days, called for the impeachment of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and was arrested. She managed to flee, first to the former Soviet republic of Georgia and then to the United States, to continue her research on genomes.\n\nPeshkin said that Petrova was a highly skilled researcher – “she is spectacular, the best I’ve ever seen in 20 years at Harvard,” – and had a visa that enabled her to work in the US and travel abroad freely. In February, however, when she was in Paris on vacation, her boss “made a huge mistake”. He asked her to pick up a box of frog embryo samples from colleagues in France and bring them back to the lab at Harvard.\n\nThe import of these samples, Peshkin said, was legal, but Petrova made some sort of paperwork mistake on the US customs declaration form and was stopped by customs officers on her return to Logan airport in Boston.\n\nAlthough the legal penalty for improperly importing this non-toxic, non-hazardous frog material is simply a fine of up to $500, Peshkin said, immigration officers decided to deny Petrova re-entry to the US. When she informed the authorities of her very real fear of being jailed for protesting Putin’s war on Ukraine should she be returned to Russia, “she was transferred to Ice, into detention, to wait for an asylum hearing,” Peshkin said.\n\nPetrova should be eligible for parole while she waits for that hearing, Peshkin added, “but paroles are now not happening”.\n\nA GoFundMe page set up by Anderson for Petrova said that the researcher was hired to work for Harvard Medical School and had entered the US on a work visa. Anderson did not specify which work visa category Petrova was under. She said that Petrova is “supported in applying for a new visa” but added that it is a “multi-month process during which she will not be able to work thus not collect a paycheck”.\n\nReports of Petrova’s detention come just weeks after a French scientist was denied entry in the US this month after US immigration officers searched his phone and found messages critical of Donald Trump.\n\nBut Petrova’s boss told the Guardian that she does not seem to have had her visa revoked over any type of protest activity in the US. She never protested against Trump or in support of Palestinians under siege in Gaza, Peshkin said.\n\nAlso earlier this month, Canadian citizen Jasmine Mooney was detained by US authorities and was held by Ice for two weeks before being released. In another case, a German tourist, 29-year-old tattoo artist Jessica Brösche, spent six weeks in detention including eight days in solitary confinement after she was arrested at the Mexican border on 18 February.\n\nIn recent weeks, federal authorities have detained a handful of other university students and researchers – including green card holders – who have expressed Palestinian solidarity amid Israel’s deadly war on Gaza. Earlier this week, 30-year-old Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was detained by masked federal officials in dramatic footage that has caused widespread outrage.\n\nImmigration officials also detained Palestinian activist and Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil – a green card holder – earlier this month in front of his pregnant wife, Noor, a US citizen. Other students detained by immigration officials include Badar Khan Suri, an Indian postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University, after the Department of Homeland Security accused him of having ties to Hamas.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "They say never judge a book by its cover, but some viewers of The White Lotus have been doing exactly that.\n\nOnline discussion around the critically acclaimed TV show has centred on the paperbacks glimpsed in the hands of several of the show’s characters and whether they offer clues about their psyches or fate.\n\nTake Lochlan Ratliff, played by Sam Nivola, the younger brother of the protein and porn addict Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), who is seen perusing Knut Hamsun’s Hunger. The winner of the Nobel prize for literature in 1920 is described by the London Review Bookshop as “a disturbing and darkly humorous masterpiece of existential fiction”, leaving many questioning if it mirrors Lochlan’s own deepening identity crisis.\n\nView image in fullscreen Parker Posey’s character’s choice of F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Beautiful and the Damned is apt. Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBO\n\nMeanwhile, his mother, Victoria, played by Parker Posey, has been reading F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Beautiful and the Damned. Regarded as a meditation on money, power and excess, the novel seems apt for the status-obsessed lorazepam addict who is seemingly oblivious to her husband’s breakdown.\n\nThese type of details are known as “Easter eggs” – the term used in pop culture for covert messages planted within TV shows, films, music and video games. They are widely used by the popstar Taylor Swift, with her fans deciphering everything from lyrics to jewellery.\n\nThe White Lotus creator, Mike White, has long been a fan of the technique. In the second series, for example, the testa di moro busts warn of a lover’s doomed fate, while a floral dress from the 1972 film The Godfather foreshadows the fate of Jennifer Coolidge’s Tanya. The characters’ holiday reads have played a key part in previous series. Jack Edwards, a social media influencer who describes himself as “the internet’s librarian” says that BookTok – a corner of TikTok devoted to reading – particularly enjoys discovering them. “It feels quite rewarding. I like that Mike White wants us to slow down and linger, giving us time to theorise and delve into the mise en scène.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Surrounded by Narcissists, the book choice of Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), is more on the nose than other reading choices. Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBO\n\nIn the new series, Chelsea (played by Aimee Lou Wood) is seen leafing through a book of poems by Rumi – the 13th-century Persian poet whose works explore love and spiritual reflection – as she lounges by the pool of a luxury hotel in Thailand’s Koh Samui. It’s fitting for a star-sign obsessed 24-year-old who believes her shady 50-year-old boyfriend, Rick (Walton Goggins), who is visibly irritated by her presence, is her “soulmate”.\n\nMeanwhile, the dynamic of the three female friends on a group holiday is writ large in their reading choices. Laurie (Carrie Coon) is reading Emma Straub’s Modern Lovers, a novel about a trio of friends grappling with ageing; the TV star Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) has brought along Barbra Streisand’s 992-page memoir to read by the pool; and perhaps most revealingly, the newly outed Trump voter Kate (Leslie Bibb) just scrolls on her phone. Other choices such as Belinda’s (Natasha Rothwell) book, Surrounded by Narcissists, are a little more on the nose.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guide Free weekly newsletter Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

White suggested Hunger for Lochlan and Outlive, a book about longevity, for his father, Timothy (Jason Isaacs), a man facing financial ruin.\n\n“Once the actors arrived, we would meet to discuss all the little details that make up their characters and it became much easier to see the whole person,” Cory says. “The Beautiful and Damned, I originally intended for Jaclyn, but it ended up being perfect for Victoria, and The Lonely City by Olivia Laing [a book about isolation and creativity] was bought for Laurie but we ended up giving it to Piper [Ratliff, an aspiring Buddhist].”\n\nSome of the books were made by the props team including those by the fictional monk Luang Por Terra and the resort owner, Sritala Hollinger. “Mike loved the idea of creating Sritala’s book Glowing so that she would leave a copy in Jaclyn’s room,” says Cory. “We not only created the fake cover but one of the Thai producers wrote part of the book itself.”\n\nIn fact, the books are so pivotal to characterisation that not every one is even in shot. Cory says one title would have given too much away about a character “but it makes me happy knowing it’s in their bag”.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The White House accused Denmark of neglect as JD Vance landed in Greenland for an unsolicited and controversial visit to the Arctic island.\n\nShortly after flying into the ice-locked US military base of Pituffik in north-west Greenland with his wife, Usha, and other senior US officials on Friday, the vice-president told US troops he was “really interested in Arctic security”.\n\n“As you all know, it’s a big issue and it’s only going to get bigger over the coming decades,” he said. Vance also said it was “cold as shit here” as he arrived to temperatures of -19C.\n\nA senior White House official said that during a speech Vance would make the case that Danish leaders had “spent decades mistreating the Greenlandic people, treating them like second-class citizens and allowing infrastructure on the island to fall into disrepair”.\n\nIn the White House, Trump reiterated his previous claims that the US needs Greenland for “world peace”.\n\n“I think Greenland understands that the United States should own it. And if Denmark and the EU don’t understand it, we have to explain it to them,” he said in a press conference on Friday. “We need Greenland. Very importantly, for international security, we have to have Greenland.”\n\nThere are, he added, “Chinese and Russian ships all over the place”.\n\nHours before Vance’s arrival, in Nuuk political leaders agreed to form a broad four-party coalition government, in a show of national unity.\n\nIn a rebuke to the Trump administration and its public campaign to gain control of Greenland, four of the territory’s five parties signed the coalition agreement on Friday, which states on page one: “Greenland belongs to us.”\n\nThere has been a week of heightened tension, amid already strained relations between the US, Greenland and Denmark as a result of Donald Trump’s repeated threats to acquire Greenland.\n\nAccompanying Vance were Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who is at the centre of the embarrassing Signal message group security breach, his wife, Julia Nesheiwat, the energy secretary, Chris Wright, and senator Mike Lee.\n\nWriting on social media before his plane landed, JD Vance said: “We’re on our way and looking forward to it!”\n\nThe White House said Vance would address Danish treatment of Greenlanders and Arctic security in his speech.\n\n“Unfortunately, Danish leaders have spent decades mistreating the Greenlandic people, treating them like second-class citizens and allowing infrastructure on the island to fall into disrepair,” a senior White House official told Fox News.\n\nGreenland, a former Danish colony, is a semi-autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark, its foreign and security policies run by Copenhagen.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, accused the US of putting “unacceptable pressure” on Greenland and Denmark to give up the territory, adding: “It is pressure that we will resist.”\n\nOn Thursday Trump renewed his vow to take control of the island: “We need Greenland for national security and international security. So we’ll go as far as we have to go. We need Greenland. And the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark. Denmark has to have us have Greenland. And we’ll see what happens. But if we don’t have Greenland, we can’t have great international security.”\n\nThe US delegation took off from Maryland and were due to fly directly to the ice-locked American military base, built after a 1951 defence agreement between Denmark and the US – with no further stops on the island now planned by the vice-president or his wife.\n\nThe delegation’s plans were hastily rescheduled just days before to cut out visits to the capital, Nuuk, and a dog sled race in Sisimiut after widespread outrage in Nuuk and Copenhagen over the unsolicited trip. Originally the second lady was scheduled to travel without the vice-president.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most US-friendly party, Naleraq, which came second in the election, left the talks on Monday, and will not be part of the coalition.\n\nThe first page of the coalition agreement states that “no one” should have any doubt that “Greenland belongs to us.\n\n“We decide our own future. We must choose our partners ourselves. And we are the ones who dictate the pace in this regard,” it reads.\n\n“We must show the world that we are a people and a country that stands together in prosperity and adversity. Our unity as a people must always outweigh political disagreements in individual areas.”\n\nIn response to a reporter’s question about Vance, the new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the US had not shown respect for Greenland. “JD Vance is landing at a facility that is theirs [the US base]. This whole situation of coming to visit when there is no government in place, we insist, is not showing respect for an ally. It’s a shame, but now we have a government that needs to get its act together,” he said.\n\nFrederiksen congratulated Greenland’s new prime minister, saying: “I wish Jens-Frederik Nielsen and the rest of the Greenland government all the best for your work and for Greenland.\n\n“And I look forward to close cooperation in an unnecessarily conflict-filled time. Strong with a broad government and unity between different political parties. You show the strength of democracy.”\n\nDenmark’s King Frederik said: “There should be no doubt about my love for Greenland, and my connection to the Greenlandic people is intact.”\n\nThe new coalition has also stated that it will work to significantly increase Greenland’s self-determination. “A clear roadmap must be drawn up as soon as possible for which areas it is realistic to take back, after which the process must be initiated,” it stated.\n\nThe former Greenlandic prime minister, Múte B Egede, leader of Inuit Ataqatigiit, who will now be minister for finance and taxes, said that it is only together that Greenland can “meet the great pressure from outside”.\n\nThe leader of Siumut, Vivian Motzfeldt, said: “We have listened to the Greenlandic population. We have listened to the need for us to be united as the Greenlandic population. We must be able to look forward and not get stuck in the past.”\n\nShe added: “It is important that we gather our strengths, our identity and our culture.”",

Hegseth relayed times that US fighter jets would take off and his updates on death and destruction on the ground elicited triumphant comments and emojis from some others in the group.\n\nClinton wrote: “Top Trump administration officials put our troops in jeopardy by sharing military plans on a commercial messaging app and unwittingly invited a journalist into the chat. That’s dangerous. And it’s just dumb.”\n\nShe went on: “This is the latest in a string of self-inflicted wounds by the new administration that are squandering America’s strength and threatening our national security.”\n\nClinton sharply criticized the slashing of the federal workforce that has been under way since the first days of the new administration, overseen by the top Trump adviser and tech billionaire Elon Musk, although she did not mention the mogul by name or comment on the growing oligarchy that is alarming many outside the White House.\n\nClinton especially criticized the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development – a so-called soft power program introduced by John F Kennedy as president to help spread American influence around the world through human rights work, in contrast to military and diplomatic power alone.\n\n“In a dangerous and complex world, it’s not enough to be strong. You must also be smart. As secretary of state during the Obama administration, I argued for smart power, integrating the hard power of our military with the soft power of our diplomacy, development assistance, economic might and cultural influence,” she wrote.\n\n“None of those tools can do the job alone. Together, they make America a superpower. The Trump approach is dumb power. Instead of a strong America using all our strengths to lead the world and confront our adversaries, Mr Trump’s America will be increasingly blind and blundering, feeble and friendless.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its retreat from global institutions it sees as at odds with his “America First” economic policies, the Trump administration plans to quit some, such as the World Health Organization, and has cut contributions to others as part of a broad review of federal spending. The WTO was already hobbled by a US move in 2019 during Trump’s first term to block new judge appointments to its top appeals court, which left its key dispute settlement system only partially functional. Washington had accused the WTO appellate body of judicial overreach in trade disputes. The Geneva-based trade watchdog had an annual budget of 205m Swiss francs ($232.06m) in 2024. The US was due to contribute about 11% of that based on a fees system that is proportionate to its share of global trade, according to public WTO documents. A US delegate told a 4 March WTO budget meeting that its payments to the 2024 and 2025 budgets were on hold pending a review of contributions to international organisations and that it would inform the WTO of the outcome at an unspecified date, two trade sources with direct knowledge of the meeting said. A third trade source confirmed their account and said the WTO was coming up with a “Plan B” in case of a prolonged funding pause, without elaborating. All three sources asked for confidentiality because the budget meeting was private and the US funding pause has not been formally announced. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A state department spokesperson said Trump last month signed an executive order directing secretary of state Marco Rubio to review within 180 days all international organizations the US is a member of “to determine if they are contrary to US interests”.

And in a nightmare scenario for Danish officials watching this from Copenhagen, he adds: “And then we’re gonna talk just about, as you’ve heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration, so we’re gonna talk a little bit about that with our friends in the media.” He then goes on: “The Trump administration, the President is really interested in Arctic security.

By a 2-1 vote, a panel of appellate judges left in place an order temporarily prohibiting deportations of the migrants under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act. The Justice Department argued in court papers that federal courts shouldn’t interfere with sensitive diplomatic negotiations. It also claimed that migrants should make their case in a federal court in Texas, where they are being detained. The order temporarily blocking the deportations was issued by US district judge James Boasberg, the chief judge at the federal courthouse in Washington. Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since the second world war to justify the swift deportation of hundreds of people he alleged to be gang members under a presidential proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.

US consumer sentiment has fallen to its lowest in over two years, the latest poll from the University of Michigan shows. Its index of Consumer Sentiment fell to 57.0 this month, down from 64.7 in February, and 28% lower than a year ago. A measure of consumer expectations for the economy fell particularly sharply. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu explains: The expectations index plunged a precipitous 18% and has now lost more than 30% since November 2024. This month’s decline reflects a clear consensus across all demographic and political affiliations; Republicans joined independents and Democrats in expressing worsening expectations since February for their personal finances, business conditions, unemployment, and inflation. The survey also showed a jump in long-term inflation expectations: The University of Michigan sentiment index shows a bigger-than-expected drop to 57, the lowest since November 2022.

View image in fullscreen Demonstrators rally outside the US Department of Education headquarters in Washington DC on 13 March 2025. Photograph: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images The order limits the departments and classifications of federal workers who can organize a union and instructs the government to stop engaging in any collective bargaining. The office of personnel management issued a memo following the directive, providing guidance to the departments and subdivisions on the order, which included terminating their collective bargaining agreements and end voluntary union dues collection through payrolls. Following the order the Trump administration filed a lawsuit in a Texas court to support its move to end collective bargaining, claiming collective bargaining agreements “significantly constrain” the executive branch. Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, said the move was “straight out of Project 2025”, the rightwing Heritage Foundation’s manifesto to remake the federal government. This executive order is the very definition of union busting. It strips the fundamental right to unionize and collectively bargain from workers across the federal government at more than 30 agencies. It’s clear that this order is punishment for unions who are leading the fight against the administration’s illegal actions in court – and a blatant attempt to silence us.” Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union representing federal workers, said: These threats will not work. Americans will not be intimidated or silenced. AFGE isn’t going anywhere. Our members have bravely served this nation, often putting themselves in harm’s way, and they deserve far better than this blatant attempt at political punishment. “President Trump’s attempt to unlawfully eliminate the right to collectively bargain for hundreds of thousands of federal workers is blatant retribution,” said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).

Organizers say the rallies will take place in front of more than 200 Tesla locations worldwide, including nearly 50 in California alone. The protesters’ goal is to send a message to the Trump administration that they’re against what the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, is doing with the US federal government – laying off thousands of workers, cutting department budgets, giving fascist salutes and getting rid of entire agencies. Vickie Mueller Olvera, who has been organizing Tesla Takedown protests in the Bay Area, said: Nobody voted for this, and nobody voted for Elon. He’s an unelected super-billionaire and he’s a thug.

View image in fullscreen Donald Trump accused the firm of donating free legal work to support ‘destructive’ causes related to immigration and voting. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock The proclamation cited WilmerHale’s ties to Robert Mueller, the former US special counsel who investigated Russian contacts with Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. It also accused the firm of donating free legal work to support “destructive” causes related to immigration and voting, and said it discriminated based on race. Like three earlier executive orders issued by Trump against other firms, the proclamation suspended security clearances held by lawyers at WilmerHale, restricted their access to government officials and ordered a review meant to terminate federal contracts held by the firm’s clients. A WilmerHale spokesperson said Trump’s proclamation resembled an earlier executive order that was suspended by a judge. “We look forward to pursuing all appropriate remedies to this unlawful order,” the firm said. Trump has vowed to target more law firms, accusing them of “weaponizing” the legal system against him and his allies. WilmerHale, Covington, Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block, another firm named in an executive order earlier this week, are each representing clients in lawsuits against the Trump administration over issues such as immigration, transgender rights and firings of government workers. In WilmerHale’s case, the firm represents a group of inspectors general who allege the administration illegally ousted them.

Trump has issued similar orders against five firms, all in retaliation for employing or representing political enemies: Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, Paul, Weiss, Covington and Burling, and Perkins Coie. Only Perkins Coie has challenged the order in court and successfully convinced a US district judge in Washington to block it. Jenner & Block’s suit is significant because it comes at a moment when there is deep concern that the legal community isn’t doing enough to push back against Trump’s efforts to target firms. Lawyers and other experts see Trump’s executive orders targeting firms as an anti-democratic program to intimidate adversaries and make it more difficult to challenge him and his administration in court. That concern escalated after Paul, Weiss reached an agreement with the Trump administration to withdraw the executive order against it. Another major firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is reportedly in talks with the Trump administration to avoid having an executive order issued against it, the New York Times reported (paywall) Thursday evening. Trump targeted Jenner & Block over the firm’s employment of Andrew Weissmann, a former prosecutor who worked on Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia during the 2016 campaign. Weissmann hasn’t worked at the firm since 2021 and has been a prominent Trump critic, frequently appearing on television. Jenner & Block’s suit, filed in the federal district court in Washington DC, details how the order cripples the firm. Over the last five years, 40% of its revenue have come from clients who are government contractors, subcontractors, or affiliated with the government. It also says it harms the firm’s pro-bono practice because it may represent clients and take positions that are at odds with the administration. Lawyers from Cooley LLP, which is representing Jenner & Block, say that the executive order targeting the firm is blatantly unconstitutional. “The Constitution, top to bottom, protects against such attempts by the government to target citizens and lawyers based on the opinions they voice, the people with whom they associate, and the clients they represent,” it says. Creating a list of disfavored law firms, it says, is “ is anathema to our scheme of ordered liberty.” Share Updated at 09.49 EDT",

        "content": "The US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth has a tattoo that appears to read “infidel” or “non-believer” in Arabic, according to recently posted photos on his social media account.\n\nIn photos posted on Tuesday on X, the Fox News host turned US defense secretary had what appears to be a tattoo that says “kafir”, an Arabic term used within Islam to describe an unbeliever. Hegseth appears to have also had the tattoo in another Instagram photo posted in July 2024.\n\nSome people on social media criticized Hegseth for getting a tattoo that could be considered offensive to Muslims, especially as the US military seeks to represent a diverse pool of faiths. It is estimated that upwards of 5,000 to 6,000 US military members practice Islam.\n\n“This isn’t just a personal choice; it’s a clear symbol of Islamophobia from the man overseeing U.S. wars,” posted Nerdeen Kiswani, a pro-Palestinian activist in New York.\n\nShe added: “‘Kafir’ has been weaponized by far-right Islamophobes to mock and vilify Muslims. It’s not about his personal beliefs. It’s about how these beliefs translate into policy – how they shape military decisions, surveillance programs, and foreign interventions targeting Muslim countries.”\n\nA former leader of the far-right Proud Boys, Joe Biggs, also has a similar tattoo.\n\n“Tattooing the Arabic word kafir – which refers to someone who knowingly denies or conceals fundamental divine truths – on his body is a display of both anti-Muslim hostility and personal insecurity,” Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), told Newsweek.\n\nThis is not the first time Hegseth has been involved in a tattoo-related controversy. The defense secretary has previously shown off tattoos that indicate a fascination with “crusader aesthetics”, an increasing trend among the far right.\n\nHis prior contentious tattoo is located on his right biceps – right next to the new one. It reads “Deus Vult”, which translates to “God Wills It” in Latin, believed to be a Crusader battle cry. Hegseth also has a tattoo on his chest of the Jerusalem cross, also known as the Crusader’s cross due to being popularized during the Christian Crusades.\n\nThe criticism of the tattoo comes at a time of increased scrutiny for the defense secretary. Members of Congress in the US are calling for an investigation into Hegseth and the other officials involved in the Signal leak that inadvertently exposed operational details of US plans to bomb Yemen. Several representatives have called for Hegseth to resign.",

        "title": "Trump executive order on Smithsonian targets funding for ‘improper ideology’",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has ordered a highly controversial reshaping of the US Smithsonian Institution, claiming he will eliminate what his administration regards as “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” from the world’s largest set of museums, educational and research entities grouped under one institutional umbrella.\n\nIn an executive order issued late on Thursday, the president said there had been a “concerted and widespread” effort over the past decade to rewrite US history by replacing “objective facts” with a “distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth”. The announcement has sparked outrage from critics, accusing Trump of taking action to “remove diversity” from American history.\n\nThe order directs JD Vance, the vice-president, to “remove improper ideology” from the Smithsonian’s museums, education and research centers and the National zoo.\n\nIt also directs Vance to ensure that the American Women’s History Museum does not “recognize men as women in any respect”, as the rightwing administration continues its mission against progressive policies and culture in US society.\n\nVance has been directed to work with congressional leaders in the House and Senate to appoint new citizen members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents who will be “committed to advancing the policy of this order”.\n\nIn language that reflected Republican talking points often heard on hard-right news channels, Trump claimed the US had witnessed an effort to “rewrite history”.\n\n“Under this historical revision, our Nation’s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed,” the president said.\n\nTrump’s order pointed to an exhibit at the American Art Museum, titled: The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture.\n\nTrump said the exhibit “claims that the United States has ‘used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement’”.\n\nHe added that the exhibit “promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct”. Trump complained that the exhibit uses the phrase: “Race is a human invention.”\n\nThe order also lists depictions of “White culture” at the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) as examples of these “harmful and oppressive” exhibits.\n\nTrump also appeared to suggest that Confederate-era names and statues, many of which have been removed in recent years, could be reissued to parks and memorial sites.\n\n“The Order also directs the Secretary of the Interior restore federal parks, monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties that have been improperly removed or changed in the last five years to perpetuate a false revision of history or improperly minimize or disparage certain historical figures or events,” Trump said.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution was established in the mid-19th century with funds from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the US to found “at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge”.\n\nCongresswoman Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat representing Texas, who is Black, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in response to the order: “First Trump removes any reference of diversity from the present — now he’s trying to remove it from our history. Let me be PERFECTLY clear— you cannot erase our past and you cannot stop us from fulfilling our future.”\n\nAllison Wiltz, founder of Writers and Editors of Color, said all Trump does is cause harm. She posted: “Enslaved people built the Smithsonian. And yet, Trump doesn’t see Black history as worthy, so he’s ordering our contributions removed. You can tell a lot about someone by how they choose to use their power.”\n\nMany others using social media have reacted with concern to the new order, with worries about the increase in racial and “eugenic” language used by the far-right, as well as by those who hold power in the US government.\n\nHenry M Rosenberg wrote on X: “I volunteer at the @NMAAHC in the Family History Center where we help people trace their genealogy back to slavery. The rest of the museum talks about the slave trade, slavery & Civil Rights. Let that fucking piece of shit try to change that.”\n\nThis marks Trump’s latest foray into taking over art and cultural centers in the US that he considers as going against his conservative ideals. Trump recently had himself appointed as chairman of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in Washington DC with the aim of overhauling scheduled performances and available programs, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show.\n\nSome artists and shows due for performances there found their events canceled, others, such as a planned run of the hit musical Hamilton, withdrew in protest.\n\nThe Trump administration also recently forced Columbia University, the Ivy League college in New York, to make a series of policy changes by threatening the institution with cuts in federal funding that amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump also created the “DC safe and beautiful task force” by executive order. It will be chaired by Stephen Miller, the US homeland security adviser.\n\nAccording to the order, the taskforce will coordinate with local officials on such matters as enforcing federal immigration law, including deporting people living illegally in the city, boosting law enforcement presence, and increasing the speed and lowering the cost of processing applications to carry concealed weapons.\n\nReuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s appointment of a career health researcher to head the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provoked a serious rightwing backlash for the new administration.\n\nDozens of Maga influencers, along with many rank-and-file Trump supporters, have taken to social media to denounce Susan Monarez to spin false conspiracy theories about her connections to the CIA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).\n\nOn X, Truth Social, across rightwing “alt-tech” sites and in segments of rightwing media, there was a vociferous response to the announcement this week that Monarez would continue in the position she has been acting in at the CDC, following the withdrawal of Trump’s initial nominee, David Weldon, who unlike Monarez has a history of supporting fringe theories which oppose vaccination.\n\nThe firestorm among the conspiracy theorists and science deniers of the anti-vaccine set shows the power of that constituency among Trump’s circle as it quickly forced Trump’s Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Robert F Kennedy, to defend the hire in a post on X.\n\nKennedy wrote: “X posts that erroneously attribute Biden-era tweets supporting masks, lockdowns, vaccine mandates, etc. to my @CDCgov Director nominee, Susan Monarez, have understandably provoked agita within the MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] movement.”\n\nHe continued, “I handpicked Susan for this job because she is a longtime champion of MAHA values, and a caring, compassionate and brilliant microbiologist and a tech wizard who will reorient CDC toward public health and gold-standard science.”\n\nThe opposition to Monarez – an immunologist with decades of government service – has so far been couched entirely in terms of the anti-vaccine beliefs that have consumed a segment of Trump’s base in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic. Kennedy himself is also well known for holding fringe beliefs around vaccines and other health matters and has called his agenda Make America Healthy Again (Maha).\n\nOn Monday John Sabal, who on social media goes by the Patriot Voice, told his 150,000 X followers that Monarez was “a DARPA stooge” and “quite literally the OPPOSITE of the MAHA agenda”.\n\nSabal – a sometime guest of far-right media personality Alex Jones – folded Monarez’s appointment into a conspiracy narrative which encompassed Elon Musk’s Starlink, mRNA vaccines and the Trump-backed “Project Stargate” AI initiative.\n\nHe concluded: “We are heading towards AI Governance Technocracy at WARP SPEED.”\n\nLike hundreds of other critics on X, Sabal had conflated the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), a HHS agency created in 2022 where Monarez was previously deputy director, with Darpa, an agency of the Department of Defense.\n\nOn Tuesday, Margo Montez-Lind, who posts on X to over half a million followers as “@ProudArmyBrat”, posted about Monarez: “She worked for Biden & Obama. She supports all of Fauci’s policies, and is a huge proponent of Big Pharma. She pushes the dangerous Mrna covid jab for babies. Loves boosters. Loves masks. This is an absolute nightmare!”\n\nMany other posters interpreted the appointment as a sign of the Trump administration’s hostility to anti-vaxxers, and even as evidence of a broader conspiracy in which Kennedy himself may be a mere pawn.\n\n“Trump picked RFK to keep MAHA people quiet,” wrote one. “He had no intention of stopping anything.”\n\nThe revolt was also visible on Trump’s own Truth Social platform. Users responding to Trump’s announcement of the nomination connected Monarez to the “chemtrails” conspiracy theory and railed against Monarez’s expressions of support for research funded by Bill Gates’s philanthropic foundation.\n\nThe X posters haranguing Kennedy were amplified across a galaxy of anti-vax outlets, many of them on the newsletter platform Substack.\n\nThe outrage soon spread to rightwing media. Grant Stinchfield of Real America’s Voice headlined the nomination as a “Maha Betrayal”. Former Infowars broadcaster David Knight said that Monarez was “same as old boss but now with AI genetic injection”.\n\nThe appointment may indeed reflect Trump’s own historic inconsistencies on vaccines. Over time, Trump has alternated between welcoming the support, donations and votes of anti-vaxxers, and claiming credit for the mRNA vaccines developed in response to the Covid-19 epidemic under the auspices of Operation Warp Speed during his first administration.\n\nThe Guardian contacted Monarez and the CDC but received no response.\n\nWeeks before Monarez’s nomination, the CDC announced plans to study any links between vaccines and autism. The belief that such a link exists is a core commitment for many anti-vaxxers, even though it is founded on discredited pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.\n\nMonarez’s nomination comes as Trump and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk’s assault on federal agencies roils the CDC.\n\nThe day after Trump’s announcement, five senior officials reportedly left the agency, including the heads of the agency’s Office of Science, the Public Health Infrastructure Center, and the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. Also out: CDC communications director Kevin Griffis.\n\nKennedy’s attempts to defend Monarez had little impact with outraged Maha figures.\n\nStella Immanuel, a Cameroonian American physician and pastor who came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic as an advocate for treating coronavirus with hydroxychloroquine, which has been repeatedly proved to be ineffective, posted in response: “That’s all great Secretary, but it’s time to ban mRNA injections! It’s time to prosecute Anthony Fauci. It’s time to remove vaccine mandates from our schools.”",

        "content": "Wall Street’s primary indexes fell sharply on Friday, as data underscored underlying price pressures, stoking fears that the Trump administration’s tariff maneuvers could further exacerbate inflationary trends.\n\nAll the US’s major indices had fallen by Friday afternoon with the S&P 500 down more than 2%, the Dow Jones declining 1.75% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumping 2.7%.\n\nA commerce department report showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose in line with expectations. However, excluding volatile items such as food and energy, the index rose more than expected on an annual basis in the previous month, while consumer spending rebounded after falling in January.\n\nThe PCE price index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation and core PCE – excluding food and energy – rose by 2.8% in February, up from 2.6% in January, still uncomfortably above the Fed’s 2% annual inflation rate target.\n\nThe Fed has held off cutting interest rates as it monitors the rate of inflation citing “heightened uncertainty” for the decision earlier this month.\n\nAdding to the unease, final figures released by the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment deteriorated further in March to it slowest level since 2022.\n\nEquities have experienced significant declines over the past month, driven by concerns that Donald Trump’s wavering policies might steer the economy towards a period of heightened inflation and tepid growth, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy trajectory.\n\n“The problem is we don’t know the rules and businesses really struggle with that,” said Bob Doll, chief executive officer of Crossmark Investments.\n\n“Part of the economic weakness we’re experiencing and likely to see more of is a function of individuals and businesses saying, ‘I’m not quite sure what tomorrow’s going to bring, so I’ll just be a little more cautious.’”\n\nTrump’s steadfast commitment to a 25% tariff on auto imports, set to take effect next week, weighed on auto stocks for a second day, with General Motors and Ford falling over 2% each.\n\nAttention now turns to a fresh round of tariffs the US intends to unveil on 2 April, with Trump hinting that these measures might diverge from the straightforward tit-for-tat duties previously pledged.\n\nSimultaneously, a report indicated that the European Union is weighing concessions to Trump after the enactment of reciprocal tariffs.\n\nReuters contributed reporting\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "20. Recently (1987)\n\nAs with a lot of her 60s peers, Joan Baez seemed slightly out of place in the 80s. She only released two studio albums that decade but came out swinging on Recently. It’s a steely rebuttal of her ex-husband’s memoir, which was downbeat about both their marriage and 60s radicalism: “You could say we failed … but I prefer remembering the way we were.”\n\n19. Gulf Winds (1976)\n\nMost of the Gulf Winds album leaned towards commerciality and a sound that would now be called yacht rock, but the 10-minute title track is something else: Baez alone with her guitar, singing a potent, moving reflection upon her childhood, her Mexican heritage, her father’s idealism and her parents’ divorce.\n\nView image in fullscreen Baez on stage at the Rainbow theatre in London, 1980. Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns\n\n18. Fishing (1997)\n\nThe sound of Fishing is standard-issue late-90s post-grunge US rock, but it’s a melodically powerful song: moreover, the barely contained fury with which Baez sings folk singer Richard Shindell’s sharp lyrics – about an undocumented Latin American migrant facing a US immigration officer – is quite something to behold.\n\n17. Barbara Allen (1961)\n\nA perfect early example of what Langston Hughes called Baez’s “transmutation into self”: her ability to impose her own character on to traditional material. Samuel Pepys wrote of singing Barbara Allen on New Year’s Eve 1665; it seems unlikely his version was as spellbinding as the one Baez recorded.\n\n16. The President Sang Amazing Grace (2018)\n\nThere’s something depressing about the fact that Baez’s final album returned her to the territory of 1964’s Birmingham Sunday, about the 16th Street Baptist church bombing: 44 years on, another protest song about another racist atrocity in a Black church, this time the 2015 Charleston shootings. Written by Zoe Mulford, it’s an incredible song; Baez’s reading lends it a stately dignity and power.\n\n15. Children and All That Jazz (1975)\n\nA departure for Baez, possibly influenced by Joni Mitchell. Children and All That Jazz is, as its title suggests, a witty, charming meditation on motherhood (“go to bed now – it’s quarter to nine, I’m tired”) recorded with jazz pianist Hampton Hawes. The latter’s solo is fantastic, as is Baez’s dramatic, triple-tracked vocal.\n\n14. North (1967)\n\nAmid the Joan album’s covers of Lennon and McCartney, Tim Hardin and Jacques Brel, North stood out: it featured an early co-writing credit for Baez and a lovely, heart-rending melody. Peter Schickele’s arrangement, meanwhile, is perfect: subtle, sympathetic, amping up the melancholy by way of strings and – very occasionally – glockenspiel.\n\nView image in fullscreen Serenading hippies and tourists at the corner of Haight and Ashbury in San Francisco, 1967. Photograph: AP\n\n13. There But for Fortune (1964)\n\nBaez’s name is most closely associated with that of Bob Dylan, but she also recorded the definitive version of Dylan’s friend and rival Phil Ochs’ most celebrated song, turning it into a UK Top 10 hit in the process. It’s a beautiful performance that amplifies the lyric’s empathy for societal outcasts, and the anti-war message of its final verse.\n\n12. The Altar Boy and the Thief (1977)\n\nOn which Baez, who came out as bisexual in 1973, offers a piano-backed and beautifully drawn portrait of two strangers meeting in a gay bar, which gradually turns into a rallying call. It was released in the year that American singer Anita Bryant began a virulent and widely publicised anti-gay campaign called Save Our Children.\n\n11. Silver Dagger (1960)\n\nIn a sense, Baez’s take on Silver Dagger is bowdlerised – other versions feature the lovers reacting to parental disapproval with a suicide pact – but no matter. The opening track of her eponymous debut album revealed listeners were in the presence of someone special, her guitar-picking intricate but urgent, her voice pure but affecting.\n\n10. Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose) (1972)\n\nBoth the previous year’s Attica Prison uprising and her husband David Harris’s imprisonment for refusing the Vietnam draft seem to hang over Prison Trilogy. It presses Nashville musicians into a pedal steel-decorated song, with a lovely tune that nevertheless carries an uncompromising message: “Help us raze the prisons to the ground.”\n\n9. We Shall Overcome (1963)\n\nA ubiquitous protest song of the 60s and beyond, yet Baez’s version is arguably the most iconic: partly because she sang it during the 1963 march on Washington, but mostly because it perfectly balances tenderness and steely determination. She later called the song “trite”, but she sounds like she believes every word.\n\nView image in fullscreen The live versions of Baez recorded in the 70s are well worth hunting down. Photograph: Paul Liebhardt/Corbis/Getty Images\n\n8. Sweet Sir Galahad (1970)\n\nApparently the first song Baez wrote alone, Sweet Sir Galahad sweetly details her widowed sister’s romance with music producer Milan Melvin, setting the story of their courtship to the kind of melody that sounds as though it’s always existed. Performing it at Woodstock, she called it “mediocre”. It definitely isn’t.\n\n7. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down (1971)\n\nBaez’s 1971 recording of the Band’s American civil war epic was her biggest hit, but you’ll need to root through bootleg recordings of Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Tour to hear her best versions: far beefier-sounding than the studio version, amped up by the raw power of Dylan’s backing band.\n\n6. Farewell Angelina (1965)\n\nThe psychology behind some of Baez’s Dylan covers can give you pause – Farewell Angelina could be about her, or Dylan’s departure from the folk scene, or both. She sang it at the Newport folk festival at which he “went electric”, and the result is sad magic: her voice cuts through to the song’s emotional core.\n\nView image in fullscreen Baez and Bob Dylan in London, 1965. Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images\n\n5. Dida (1975)\n\nIn 2008, Joni Mitchell claimed she and Baez were frenemies – “she would have broken my leg if she could” – but you wouldn’t have known from this duet: their voices swoop around each other, the effect as warm as the sunlit room Baez stands in on the cover of Diamonds and Rust.\n\n4. Love Is Just a Four Letter Word (1968)\n\nBaez performed many Dylan songs, but Love Is Just a Four Letter Word is definitively hers: Dylan has never recorded or played the song live. Lyrically and melodically, it’s fantastic, clearly a product of his songwriting zenith: if the sitar on the studio recording proves a period detail too far, there’s a great 1976 live version.\n\n3. Birmingham Sunday (1964)\n\nWritten by Baez’s brother-in-law Richard Fariña, about the Ku Klux Klan church bombing that also inspired John Coltrane’s Alabama, Baez’s performance is more lamentation than protest. It’s a masterclass in the power of restraint, as if she has taken the line about singing “so softly it’ll do no one wrong” to heart.\n\n2. Love Song to a Stranger (1972)\n\nCome From the Shadows was a political album – it featured a song admonishing Dylan for his lack of engagement – but it also contained one of Baez’s most beautiful love songs, about the restorative powers of a one-night stand. Or as she puts it: “Passionate strangers who rescue each other from a lifetime of cares.”\n\n1. Diamonds and Rust (1975)\n\nIt’s one of the great ironies of Baez’s career: she is too often unfairly presented in pop history as merely an adjunct to Dylan’s rise, yet the song you would present as incontrovertible proof of her greatness as a writer is about … Dylan. But for all its scattering of historical details, Diamonds and Rust could be about anyone: its cocktail of tender nostalgia, weariness (“here comes your ghost again”) and simmering anger provoked by encountering an old flame with whom things ended badly is perfectly fixed, universally applicable and delivers an emotional gut punch.",

        "title": "What caused Myanmar and Thailand earthquake and how big was it?",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "An earthquake with a 7.7 magnitude has hit central Myanmar, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has said, with Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, among other areas affected. We take a look at the origins of the event and the scale of the disaster.\n\nWhat happened? According to the USGS, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Mandalay, Myanmar at 6.21am GMT. The quake is thought to have been shallow, arising at a depth of just 10km (6 miles), but the damage is expected to be enormous, with multiple buildings collapsed or damaged and reports of roads buckled and broken. The death toll is climbing, with fatalities reported in both Myanmar and Thailand. Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said: “It is highly likely that build quality will generally not be high enough to survive this level of shaking, and casualty numbers will almost certainly climb significantly as more becomes known of the scale of the disaster.”\n\nWhat caused the earthquake? Earthquakes arise when huge slabs of rock that make up the Earth’s crust, known as tectonic plates, move against each other. According to USGS, the Myanmar quake occurred as the result of “strike slip faulting” between the India and Eurasia plates – meaning that these two tectonic plates rubbed sideways against each other. Map showing areas affected by earthquake “The quake happened on the Sagaing fault, which marks the tectonic plate boundary between the Indian plate to the west and the Eurasian plate to the east. The Indian plate is moving north along the fault compared to the Eurasian plate,” said McGuire. The USGS says the region has experience several similar large strike slip earthquakes in the past, with six occurring within about 250km of the current earthquake since 1900 that were magnitude 7 or greater.\n\nWhat do these magnitude figures mean? While many people have heard of the Richter scale to measure the size of an earthquake, the current standard is the moment magnitude scale. “The Richter scale is an old scale developed for California. It is only good for smaller quakes, and is not very good at differentiating the sizes of bigger shocks,” said McGuire. As the USGS website notes, the moment magnitude calculation is based on the strength of the rock where the slip occurred, the area of the fault that slipped, and the distance the fault moved. “Thus, stronger rock material, or a larger area, or more movement in an earthquake, will all contribute to produce a larger magnitude,” it adds. However, like the Richter scale, the moment magnitude scale is logarithmic, meaning that as the magnitude increases by one unit, the degree of ground shaking involved increases 10-fold. “This is a major quake by any standard, and its impact is made far worse by the fact that it was very shallow – only about 10km down. If it had been 100km deep, the impact would have been much smaller, so depth as well as size is critical,” said McGuire. But, he added, measurements do vary dependent on the locations of the seismic arrays used. According to the China Earthquake Networks Center the Myanmar earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude, with tremors felt in China’s south-west Yunnan province.\n\nWill there be further quakes? “There has already been one large aftershock, and others can be expected in coming hours to days,” said McGuire. “These can bring down already weakened buildings and make the work of rescuers even more challenging.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "‘I’ve done any and all number of sexual situations in my 30-year career,” says Michelle Williams, all matter-of-fact and puckishly charming. “But I’ve never masturbated on film before … and I was nervous. It’s much easier to portray mutual desire than just the desire for oneself. But God, when Liz [Meriwether] wrote those scenes – when Molly’s alone in the hotel and by the end she’s masturbating to anything, masturbating to a fish in a bowl! – I thought: ‘Oh Liz. You’ve really done it.’”\n\nIn Williams’s new show, Dying for Sex, she spends one entire episode masturbating – a staggeringly unusual thing for a woman to do on screen. Dying for Sex has a very simple premise, so grab-you-by-the-throat tragic that you’d almost take against it. Except it’s based on a true story, which was made into a podcast. Molly is 42, and in remission from a bout of cancer that has robbed her of the marital sex life that wasn’t all that anyway, when she gets the news that the cancer has come back, and is terminal. A palliative care nurse – brilliantly played by Esco Jouley – asks her about a bucket list. Her initial resistance gives way to the realisation that she’s never had an orgasm with another person, and that’s all she wants. So she leaves her husband to spend the rest of her short life chasing tail.\n\nI was astonished to find myself crying within 13 minutes. Williams tells me exactly the same thing happened to her when she listened to the podcast: “And I’m not a crier. Things don’t get to me. I’m thick-skinned, I’m experienced, I’m savvy. It takes a lot to break through that.” It’s a very straight-down-the-line description, and the opposite of how she looks, which is much younger than 44, wide-eyed, elfin. In so many of her roles, Williams enlivens a kind of protectiveness, which she then undercuts in some way – in Dawson’s Creek it was with party-girl antics; in Brokeback Mountain, her Oscar-nominated turn, her vulnerability is both manipulative and tragic, as she ventriloquises the homophobia of her society; in Dying for Sex, everything is laced with bone-deep wit. “As soon as I had that reaction to the podcast, I thought: ‘Well, I’m sunk. Whatever this thing is, I’ve already emotionally signed on.’”\n\nView image in fullscreen Climactic scene … Michelle Williams as Molly in Dying for Sex. Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FX\n\nIt is an exquisitely affecting performance, but that’s not what’s radical about the show. First, it’s all the sex, “and we made this pre-All Fours. That book hadn’t come out yet. The world hadn’t been split wide open.” She’s talking about Miranda July’s semi (massively) autobiographical novel, which people call the first great menopause novel when it is actually (in my view) much more about female sexual appetite. In July’s telling, that appetite is immense and terrifying, can and will destroy anything in its path, particularly if what’s in its path is “marriage”. Anyway, Dying for Sex came first, and also kicks off with the protagonist leaving her partner. From there, Molly’s journey is as explosive as an Exocet missile. She discovers her inner dominatrix with a neighbour (played by Rob Delaney) who doesn’t use the rubbish chute correctly, and gets there via a same-sex experiment with submission.\n\nBut this is TV that’s also like Grand Theft Auto for cliches, casually shooting down norms and taboos like they’re defenceless passersby. The central female friendship is much more than a bit of sisterly support; Molly effectively swaps her husband for her best friend, Nikki (Jenny Slate), a charismatic, chaotic actor who already has amazing sex all the time. Jungians call this relationship the golden shadow – the friend who’s similar but excels you in some way you deeply value. The real-life Nikki Boyer worked with them on set, signing off the show’s embellishments – and it’s a gorgeous depiction of “that person [who] knows you in a wordless way, there’s no explaining, you’re not trying to woo, you’re not trying to impress”, but not idealised. Nikki is, as the abandoned husband Steve (Jay Duplass) constantly points out, the last person you want around when you’re having palliative chemotherapy. She can’t even reliably find her purse in her own handbag.\n\nDesire is a “portal” for Molly, says Williams, “and maybe that’s what moved us so much about it, is that she chose to see it as an opportunity – to gather something together and take it and imbibe it, own it, before she was divested of everything. She’s saying, I’m committing to this journey, and the only thing I’m taking with me is you, my best friend. I’m going to pursue my own pleasure in the midst of this illness, which is going to ultimately take my life and cause me a lot of pain. I’m going to continue to seek pleasure in this body, which is capable of both those things.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Bed fellows … Jenny Slate as Nikki (left) with Williams in Dying for Sex. Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FX\n\nThen there’s the menopause, which Molly has chemically induced as part of her treatment plan (and says, plaintively, “I thought the one good thing about dying was that I wouldn’t have to go through the menopause”). It’s still high jeopardy, playing a woman experiencing menopause – like playing a grandmother, actors cross a Rubicon where they no longer get cast in younger roles. Williams shrugs the risk off, as if to indicate that she doesn’t worry about things like that. Much less so now, but omertà around talking about menopause at all was so strong until recently that a woman in her 40s might, as Williams describes, “never have had this conversation. Nobody had ever mentioned to me that this was in my future. Not my mother, not my grandmother, not a doctor.”\n\nThe real Molly loved to take pictures of herself in hospital, says Williams. “She liked to buy beautiful lingerie, it made her feel great, and she would take beautiful photos of herself, hide her scars, send these selfies out, and communicate with strangers. When she was no longer able to have bodily encounters, she was still sexting from her hospital bed.”\n\nAnother stunningly mould-breaking thing about Dying for Sex is that there’s a huge amount of affection and acceptance and delight between Molly and the people she sleeps with. It’s not because they’re in love – nobody’s trying to turn this into a romcom – it’s simply what’s liable to happen when people desire each other and are open about what they want. On the podcast, after Molly dies, Nikki speaks to some of her lovers and, Williams says, one of them responds: “‘She made me feel so seen, and like I was OK – like the things that I desired, there was no shame or judgment about them.’ I think there’s some connection there, between what illness does to her body, and what desire does to a body. Because bodies have a mind of their own. They do things without us wanting them to. They get sick without us wanting them to. They secrete things without us wanting them to. And desire can also work like that.”\n\nFrom certain angles, the cancer – as real and inexorable and based-on-true-events as it is – functions as a shortcut to utopia. “Could you live like this if you didn’t have a terminal diagnosis? Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” says Williams. At one point, she’s in an Uber with a guy, on their way to have sex, when it all gets too much for him and he prematurely ejaculates. “It isn’t making fun of him, it isn’t ‘How lame, what a disappointment’, it’s thrilling and exhilarating, just to radically accept people as they are.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FX\n\nWilliams makes the case that, ultimately, Dying for Sex isn’t about dying or sex. If there’s a central theme, it’s sexual abuse. That’s why sexual fulfilment has eluded Molly to that point – she was abused by one of her mother’s boyfriends when she was seven: “She was split off from herself because of the abuse she experienced when she was a child. She still grew up, but a part of herself is frozen in time at that age – she’s in amber. I think that’s what she sets out to do, even though she doesn’t know that’s what she’s doing – the sexual journey is trying to repair the original wound while she still has time.”\n\nWhen she signed up for Dying for Sex more than three years ago, Williams discovered she was pregnant with her third child, her second with producer Thomas Kail (the father of her oldest daughter is Heath Ledger). “We toyed with the idea of using CG and painting out my stomach, but decided it would just be completely preposterous to do these scenes with a giant belly between me and my co-stars.” They had to wait, but that was fine because she really doesn’t work all that much, she says – this is the first thing she’s done since The Fabelmans, Steven Spielberg’s movie memoir. That looks like great confidence – the conviction to wait for something good, the courage to say no – but she bats that off. “No, it’s just having small children. I want to stay home with them.”\n\nI ask quickly about one of her other great roles: her 2014 Broadway turn as Sally Bowles in Cabaret – the musical about nightclub performers in 1930s Berlin as Nazism is on the rise. It felt as if that role really belonged to her, but “everybody feels like that”, she says. “Judi Dench used to say: ‘Oh, Sally Bowles? My part?’” It’s such a fantastic part, the tough-but-fragile, private-but-public siren, and no two actors ever play it the same way, and Williams brought a gaucheness and uncertainty that was truer to Christopher Isherwood’s book than the Liza Minnelli film. It must have been fun to do a production before there was so much actual fascism in the air, right? “I hope that a time comes when it loses its context,” she says, heavily. “I wish Cabaret didn’t feel so modern. I can’t wait for it to feel dusty.”\n\nMmm, same. But such consolation to the turmoil of the world as ordinary life, sex and death can offer, Dying for Sex has in spades. One of the things that’s rarely said about dying, or the menopause for that matter, is that it might not be characterised by sadness or brain fog but by sexual voraciousness. “This is what the real Molly was facing – how is she going to use her body sexually when it’s failing her in so many ways? But she figures it out. Esther Perel [the psychotherapist] talks about sex as an antidote to death. What could make you feel more alive? I think a lot about that … If you want to continue to explore sexually through menopause, you need to become creative. If you want to explore sexually through illness, you need to become creative.”\n\nDying for Sex is on Disney+ from 4 April",

        "title": "Why hasn’t middle America given Paige Bueckers the Caitlin Clark treatment?",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "UConn’s Paige Bueckers, the probable No 1 pick in this year’s WNBA draft, is a brilliant talent, although she may not want you to point that out.\n\n“Everybody was focused on me and what I did at UConn my freshman year,” she said during last year’s NCAA Tournament. “But I think it’s more important for the game to share the spotlight to grow the game and show all the stars of college basketball and not just focus on one particular player, whether it be me, Caitlin [Clark], JuJu [Watkins], Angel [Reese]. There’s so many names in college basketball now that are huge, that are stars that deserve credit.”\n\nThat’s very admirable of her, but sometimes praise is due. In 2021, Bueckers was the first freshman to earn the Wooden Award, Naismith Trophy, AP Player of the Year and USBWA Player of the Year. She also led the Huskies in points, assists, steals and three-point percentage for a team that played in the Final Four and finished 28-2 overall.\n\nThen, in July 2022, she tore her ACL and missed the entire 2022-23 season. She had also been sidelined by injury for 19 games the previous season.\n\nBut this season she is healthy and wreaking havoc on every team she faces. She is the model of efficiency. Right now, Bueckers is the only player across the NBA, WNBA and college basketball with a 50/40/90 line and top assist to turnover ratio. She’s averaging nearly 20 points per game and a conference-best 4.8 assists per game. It’s little wonder her team are one of the favorites to win the championship.\n\nTo bounce back from a series of serious injuries is amazing in itself, but to come back arguably better than she was before deserves a standing ovation. And, yet, Bueckers doesn’t receive the same fawning attention from large parts of white America as Clark, a player of similar skills. Why?\n\nPerhaps it’s because, unlike Clark, Bueckers has always been outspoken about issues off the court. At the 2021 ESPYs, Bueckers was named the college athlete of the year. She used her acceptance speech to celebrate and honor Black women in particular.\n\n“With the light that I have now as a white woman who leads a Black-led sport and celebrated here, I want to shed a light on Black women,” said Bueckers. “They don’t get the media coverage that they deserve. They’ve given so much to the sport, the community and society as a whole and their value is undeniable.”\n\nOnly 19 at the time, she told the audience that in the previous WNBA season, 80% of the postseason awards were won by Black players, but they received a fraction of the coverage given to their white peers.\n\n“I think it’s time for change. Sports media holds the key to storylines,” she said. “Sports media and sponsors tell us who is valuable, and you have told the world that I mattered today, and everyone who voted, thank you. But I think we should use this power together to also celebrate Black women.”\n\nShe went on to acknowledge Black female trailblazers. “To Maria Taylor, Robin Roberts, Maya Moore, Odicci Alexander. To all the incredible Black women in my life and on my teams,” she said. “To Breonna Taylor and all the lives lost, and to those names who are not yet learned, but I hope to share, I stand behind you and I continue to follow you, follow your lead and fight for you guys so I just want to say thank you for everything,”\n\nWhile Black America cheered Bueckers, it seemed like mainstream, white America – a demographic that once viewed her as, in her words, a “media darling” – weren’t singing her praises quite as much. And still don’t. Is this coincidence? Or maybe because her injuries have made people forget her greatness as an athlete? Possibly. But she’s back from injury now, so why aren’t people as focused on Bueckers as they were on Clark last season, when she was tearing up college basketball? Maybe if Bueckers had delivered a more vanilla ESPYs speech things would have been different.\n\nAnother factor is the Angel Reese effect. Women’s college basketball ratings surged in the last two NCAA Tournaments, some of that was to do with the excellence of the players on show. But some of it was for less edifying reasons. Much of the media made Reese the villain to Clark’s heroine after the Black Princess upstaged the Great White Hope in the 2023 NCAA Tournament championship game. The viral image of Reese defiantly waving her hand in front of her face – the same taunt Clark had used in a previous game – transformed Clark and Reese from great players to lightning rods for racial animus. People who had no interest in women’s basketball suddenly became fanatics – in every sense of the word – for all the worst reasons. They were there to cheer Clark’s whiteness, and attack Reese’s Blackness, not their talent. When she was drafted into the WNBA last year Clark repeatedly asked fans not to weaponize her, but it didn’t stop her becoming a dubious hero for bigots, who often spewed racist abuse at her Black opponents. Clark had become a huge star, because of her sheer talent – she was an WNBA All-Star and rookie of the year in 2024 – but also because of her supposed rivalry with Reese, a rivalry both players have played down (and, it has to be said, profited financially from).\n\nMeanwhile, there has been no Black villain for Bueckers to compete against. The fact that that has meant she has gained less attention and adoration from middle America says a lot about the state of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, during Ramadan Bueckers cooks breakfast for her muslim teammate, Jana El-Alfy, sings gospel songs (the Black versions) before games, has a level of connection with her Black teammates that truly resembles a sisterhood, was raised by her Black stepmother, has Black stepbrothers and sisters, has had Black boyfriends has designated herself an ally to her Black teammates on multiple occasions, not just in her ESPYs speech. All of this simply does not sit well with “that certain demographic” who embraced Clark and championed her for the wrong reasons. That’s not to say all of Clark’s fans fall into this category nor is this the fault of Clark, who just wants to play basketball.\n\nBueckers is a special player and deserves every ounce of praise and respect both on and off the court. But if she does end up winning a championship, and still doesn’t receive the praise given to Clark, you’ll know why.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "“Where is the resistance?” is a common refrain. Our research affirms that resistance is alive and well.\n\nMany underestimate resistance to the current Republican administration because they view resistance through a narrow lens. The 2017 Women’s March in particular – immediate in its response, massive in its scope and size – may inform collective imaginations about what the beginning of a resistance movement should look like during Trump 2.0.\n\nIn fact, our research shows that street protests today are far more numerous and frequent than skeptics might suggest. Although it is true that the reconfigured People’s March of 2025 – held on 18 January – saw lower turnout than the 2017 Women’s March, that date also saw the most protests in a single day for over a year. And since 22 January, we’ve seen more than twice as many street protests than took place during the same period eight years ago.\n\nIn February 2025 alone, we have already tallied more than 2,085 protests, which included major protests in support of federal workers, LGBTQ+ rights, immigrant rights, Palestinian self-determination, Ukraine and demonstrations against Tesla and Donald Trump’s agenda more generally. This is compared with 937 protests in the United States in February 2017, which included major protests against the so-called Muslim ban along with other pro-immigrant and pro-choice protests.\n\nCoordinated days of protest such as March Fourth for Democracy (4 March), Stand Up for Science (7 March), rallies in recognition of International Women’s Day (8 March) and protests demanding the release of the Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil suggest little likelihood of these actions slowing down. These are all occurring in the background of a tidal wave of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s early moves.\n\nHistorically, street protest and legal challenges are common avenues for popular opposition to governments, but economic noncooperation – such as strikes, boycotts and buycotts – is what often gets the goods. Individual participation is deliberately obscure, and targeted companies may have little interest in releasing internal data. Only the aggregate impacts are measurable – and in the case of Tesla, Target and other companies, the impacts so far have been measurable indeed.\n\nConsider the protests against Tesla in response to Elon Musk firing federal workers and blocking federal funding. The multifaceted campaign has a quite specific goal: punish Tesla, Musk’s signature company. In addition to protests at Tesla showrooms and charging stations, people have also sold their Teslas. Others have called on mutual funds to divest from Tesla stock. The stock price has dropped significantly in the last month, perhaps in part due to Musk’s Doge work.\n\nThis shift toward noncooperation over large-scale protests may be strategically wise. In 2017, many who attended Women’s Marches remained deeply engaged in civic activity, funneling into groups and coalitions like Indivisible, Swing Left, Run for Something, Fight Back Table and the like. People who aligned with Indivisible and groups like it were almost certainly responsible for saving the Affordable Care Act in 2017, largely through pressure on elected members of Congress. The Maga faction had not yet consolidated control of the GOP, and within a year the “blue wave” flipped the House during the 2018 midterms. Under such conditions, protests and political pressure made a lot of strategic sense.\n\nThose groups and others still remain active, but today’s political terrain may call for a more muscular movement strategy. The Maga faction controls the Republican party and enforces strict discipline among its members through fear and the threat of a well-funded Republican primary opponent in the next election. The supreme court majority is solidly on the right. Elected Republican officials are abandoning town halls and discouraging constituents from calling their offices. Street protests endure but are increasingly surveilled and high risk, as Khalil’s detention suggests. Uncertainty about whether the Trump administration will ignore the first amendment and weaponize the government to persecute political oppositionists looms large.\n\nIn the face of such changes, the public’s most powerful options are often withholding labor power and purchasing power. Calling in sick from work or school, refusing to buy and stay-at-home demonstrations are notoriously difficult to police. Last month, an inestimable number of people participated in such actions to highlight a Day Without Immigrants. The prominence of billionaires in the administration and populist anger toward them make this type of approach even more viable in today’s climate.\n\nIndeed, the diversification of resistance methods puts the United States on a similar trajectory to many democracy movements of the past. In anti-authoritarian movements of the 20th century, economic noncooperation – more so than protest alone – was the coordinated activity that split elites and made way for democratic breakthroughs. In apartheid South Africa, it was the enormous economic pressure – through boycotts of white-owned businesses, general strikes, divestments and capital flight – that brought the white supremacist National party to heel and elevated reformers who were willing to do business with Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress.\n\nIn communist Poland, it was the ability of trade unionists to credibly call for general strikes (and credibly call off such strikes) that gave the Solidarity movement the leverage to negotiate a peaceful democratic transition. Mahatma Gandhi’s noncooperation campaigns in India made the colony ungovernable by British colonial authorities.\n\nAnd when the Nazis invaded and occupied Denmark in the 1940s, noncooperation was near-total. No one remembered how to run the railroad. Teachers had to leave school early to tend to their gardens. Factory workers slowed down or stopped production altogether. Danes obscured the identities of their Jewish neighbors, gave them temporary haven and secured their passage through fishing boats to neutral territory, saving thousands of lives.\n\nSimilarly, in Czechoslovakia, six days after the Soviet invasion in 1968, the newspaper Večerní Praha published “10 commandments”, writing: “When a Soviet soldier comes to you, YOU: 1. Don’t know 2. Don’t care 3. Don’t tell 4. Don’t have 5. Don’t know how to 6. Don’t give 7. Can’t do 8. Don’t sell 9. Don’t show 10. Do nothing.”\n\nThese oppositional habits of thinking and practice, nurtured over two decades through underground popular schools, art, literature and outlawed news sources, ultimately paved the way for the Velvet Revolution.\n\nIndeed, the United States has its own storied history of resisting authoritarianism through noncooperation. Pro-independence colonists living under the British crown organized campaigns to refuse to buy or consume British goods; refuse to abide by laws requiring colonists to export raw materials to Britain; refuse to serve on juries under crown-appointed judges; and develop alternative institutions including the Continental Congress itself.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Fighting Back Free newsletter Big thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

In 1815, John Adams wrote to Thomas Jefferson of his hope that historians would recall those acts of noncooperation – and not the war of independence – as “the revolution”, that “was in the minds of the people”.\n\nMuch later, during the civil rights movement, desegregation was first tangibly achieved in large part through noncooperation campaigns like the courageous school attendance by the Little Rock Nine, the Montgomery bus boycotts, the lunch counter sit-ins and boycotts of businesses in Nashville and elsewhere, strikes among sanitation workers in Memphis and other acts of refusal to abide by the Jim Crow system of racial segregation. These took place in combination with marches and demonstrations that were powerful and dramatic displays of the moral power of the movement and legal action that demanded the government abide by its own constitution.\n\nThat Americans seem to be rediscovering the art, science and potency of noncooperation – combined with a robust protest capacity and legal action – shows that resistance against Trump’s agenda in America is not only alive and well. It is savvy, diversifying and probably just getting started.\n\nWhats giving me hope\n\nWhat’s giving me hope is watching ordinary people turn out at town halls, community meetings, rallies, protests, experimenting with economic noncooperation like consumer boycotts, and organizing their communities for rapid response and mutual aid. Countless people are speaking out about unconstitutional moves by the government, and in support of those who have been personally affected by them.

        "title": "Fired corporate regulator sounds ‘blinking red alarm’ over apparent rise of billionaire power under Trump",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The US is in the midst of an extraordinary battle between “the rule of law versus the rule of billionaires”, a top Democratic government official and attorney has warned, after his unprecedented firing by Donald Trump.\n\nAlvaro Bedoya, abruptly terminated as a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last week, sounded a “blinking red alarm” over backroom “quid pro quo” dealmaking he said appears to be taking place inside the Trump administration.\n\nBedoya and his colleague, commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, another Democrat, were fired from the FTC, Washington’s top antitrust watchdog. Both Bedoya and Slaughter have sued the administration over their respective dismissals, which they argue were illegal.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Bedoya expressed fear that his firing is a sign of billionaires’ growing power over the federal government. “This isn’t about progressive versus conservative,” he said. “This is about the rule of law versus the rule of billionaires.”\n\nIndependent and bipartisan agencies like the FTC are typically shielded from direct control by the White House. Supreme court precedents interpret the FTC Act’s terms, which only allow the president to remove FTC commissioners for “insufficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance” in office.\n\nWhen Bedoya first confirmed his firing on social media, he declared that the president “wants the FTC to be a lap dog for his golfing buddies”. In the days that followed, he has continued to express alarm about actions taken under Trump – and the striking group of wealthy allies and supporters he has amassed leading up to, and since, his victory last November.\n\nAt the FTC, Bedoya was involved in several cases against Amazon, for example, including allegations of the company keeping children’s voice data despite parental objections, and forcing small businesses into unfair pricing schemes. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who joined a string of tech billionaires including Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, and Sundar Pichai, the Google CEO, at Trump’s inauguration.\n\n“I think it’s remarkable that one of the last public statements I made before the president tried to fire me was denouncing the high injury rates and the working conditions at Amazon warehouse floors, such that the company literally has to position vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense painkillers,” said Bedoya.\n\nThe connection between Trump and Bezos should be clear to anyone watching closely, he suggested. Amazon donated $1m to the president’s inaugural fund, and its streaming arm reportedly paid millions of dollars for the rights for a documentary about the first lady, Melania Trump.\n\n“When you see a company with a safety track record like Amazon’s, then you see the donations from Mr Bezos and the deals that are being cut between the first family and Mr Bezos’s company, and then you see that the person nominated to head up the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is none other than an Amazon safety executive … it would be foolish to not worry about the possibility of corruption and the possibility of corporate pardon,” said Bedoya.\n\n“I don’t know what most Americans think, but I know what I think when I see it,” he added.\n\nTaylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, said: “President Trump has the lawful authority to manage personnel within the executive branch. President Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for.”\n\nBedoya’s claims about Amazon are “inaccurate and misleading”, a spokesperson for the company said.\n\n“Like any responsible employer, we make basic first aid items like over-the-counter pain relievers available to employees,” the spokesperson added, claiming that injury rates have fallen since 2019. Parents can “easily delete individual child voice recordings and transcripts” on an app linked to Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant, according to the company.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, a registered Democrat, is involved in an ongoing saga of corruption allegations, even as the Department of Justice seeks to dismiss the charges in a move that has been questioned by many.\n\n“For me, it’s a blinking red alarm about what happened with Eric Adams at the Department of Justice, where it appears there was some kind of deal struck between senior administration officials and the mayor to drop the charges against the mayor in exchange for some kind of quid pro quo,” Bedoya said.\n\n“I’m worried that that is going to come for a place like the FTC,” he said. “Because in a world where the president can fire anybody on that commission at any time, how do you say no, right?”\n\nThough Bedoya can’t say whether a majority of Americans see things the way he does, he’s hopeful that the influence of billionaires will becoming increasingly obvious, alerting more and more people to corruption within the US government.\n\nOver the weekend, he spoke at a packed rally hosted by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. While Trump continues to openly mock Democrats, such as in his controversial address to a joint session of Congress, certain leftist politicians are seeing an opportunity to foster the unity Trump failed to bring to the White House.\n\n“I think what was so exciting about that rally is that it wasn’t just about Democrats. Yes, Senator Sanders and Representative Ocasio-Cortez are Democrats, but afterwards at that rally, I was talking to the people in the audience and it was all kinds of people,” Bedoya said.\n\n“It was Democrats, it was Republicans, it was people who hated politics but know that something is wrong.”",

        "content": "As darkness fell in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city, many residents set up small tents and prepared to sleep on the streets rather than risk going back inside their homes.\n\n“We are afraid that some weak buildings might collapse,” said Ko Ko, who asked not to give his full name.\n\nMandalay was one of the areas worst affected by Friday’s earthquake, a shallow 7.7-magnitude tremor that was followed minutes later by a 6.4-magnitude aftershock.\n\nKo Ko had been driving in his car when the ground shook for the second time. “We stopped at the corner of the road because of the shaking. At that moment, a hospital collapsed right in front of me, like waffle sheets crumbling, and a large cloud of dust emerged like in the movie scene,” he said.\n\nMost places in Mandalay were badly damaged, he added.\n\nView image in fullscreen A building mid-collapse in Mandalay. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe true extent of the destruction could take time to emerge. Myanmar is ruled by a repressive military junta that took power in 2021, and which has banned most independent media, forcing journalists to operate underground or in exile.\n\nAfter the earthquake, the military – which has few allies – made a rare plea for international help, suggesting deep concern over the damage.\n\nThe military seized power after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi – a move that was widely opposed by the public and which triggered an armed resistance made up of a patchwork of pro-democracy groups and ethnic armed organisations. The junta has since lost swathes of territory along its borders, though it remains in control of areas such as Mandalay.\n\nNadi, who also asked not to give her full name, said her brother-in-law, Imran, had been praying inside a mosque when the ground began to shake violently on Friday afternoon. The force of the quake brought down all buildings inside the mosque compound.\n\nHe tried to escape, said Nadi, but was bleeding heavily. “The mobile phone networks were down and the rescue teams arrived very late,” she said. He died, aged 18.\n\nNadi said the mosque was one of two that collapsed in the area. A hotel building and surrounding houses had also been destroyed. “The hotel collapsed up to the third floor, and hotel staff and the owner remain trapped,” she said. “People are still trapped inside the houses.”\n\nThe casualties, Nadi said, were becoming “higher and higher”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Emergency services in Myanmar were already severely overstretched by the coup and subsequent conflict. Photograph: Reuters\n\nFootage shared on social media showed scenes of destruction: monasteries, mosques, flats and roads either damaged or destroyed. One video showed University of Mandalay consumed by thick smoke, while images elsewhere in the city showed buildings brought to the ground or skewed by the force of the quake.\n\nAnother showed a group of monks ducking as a large building in the distance collapsed entirely. Yet another, taken outside a damaged mosque, showed people clambering over debris and bricks. An eyewitness said eight people had been killed and others were feared trapped after a construction building in Pyigyidagun Township also collapsed.\n\nThe military regime has called for blood donors as public hospitals in the Sagaing and Mandalay regions filled with patients.\n\nHundreds of casualties were also taken to a hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, where the emergency department’s entrance had collapsed on to a car, AFP reported. Patients were treated outside. “I haven’t seen [something] like this before,” a doctor told AFP. “We are trying to handle the situation. I’m so exhausted now.”\n\nView image in fullscreen People have been sitting in the streets, fearing further tremors. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nEmergency services in Myanmar were already severely overstretched by the coup and subsequent conflict.\n\n“Myanmar is in a dire situation, where the military junta’s four-year war of attrition has plunged a third of the population – 20 million people – into poverty and humanitarian need,” said the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, an independent group of international experts set up after the coup to support the return of democracy.\n\nThe earthquake, the group added, had “come at a precarious moment when crippling aid cuts have left vulnerable communities more exposed than ever”.\n\nPeople needed reliable information, Ko Ko added, but social media feeds, where accessible, were instead flooded with unverified reports, or messages about mandatory conscription from the widely loathed military.\n\nWith rescuers overrun, local people have sought to protect themselves, he added. “People are managing on their own to solve the problem. The residents have blocked the overpass because they are afraid it will collapse.”\n\nThe aftershocks from Friday’s earthquake had continued into the evening. “About an hour ago, I felt it shake for about two seconds,” he said. For now, people in Mandalay felt safer sleeping outside.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "When George and Amal Clooney tied the knot in Venice in 2014, bringing the lagoon city to a standstill by blocking off the Grand Canal and filling its narrow alleys with celebrities and paparazzi, Venetians embraced the spectacle, proud to once again flaunt their hometown’s beauty and romance.\n\nBut news this week that Venice will host the nuptials between Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, and Lauren Sánchez, a former TV journalist, has not quite been met with the same reception.\n\nThe seed for the three-day event, due to take place between 24 and 26 June, was reportedly planted by the Italian fashion designer Domenico Dolce, who last year mentioned to Morris Ceron, the chief of staff at Venice’s council, that the couple were on the hunt for a magical destination to get married.\n\nAccording to reports in the Italian press, wedding planners have fully booked five of Venice’s plushest hotels and reserved almost the entire fleet of the city’s water taxis as well as a dock for Bezos’s mega-yacht. Hundreds of guests are expected, possibly even the US president, Donald Trump.\n\nFar from decrying overtourism, which has intensified in Venice in the 11 years since the Clooneys’ big day, leading to the introduction last year of an access charge for pesky day-trippers, Luigi Brugnaro, the city’s mayor, publicly thanked Ceron for luring the couple. “The event will have economic repercussions worth millions of euros for our city,” he told the Veneto edition of Corriere della Sera.\n\nBut not everyone sees it that way.\n\n“It’s going to be a great big nuisance,” said Francesca, a tour guide. “I think most people are of the same opinion. We are exasperated by a whole series of problems related to overtourism and this is the umpteenth thing foisted on the city that we have to suffer.”\n\nThe Clooney wedding was also a nuisance for Francesca because it caused “a lot of confusion and was impossible to move around”, but the actor and his bride, a human rights barrister, were well liked. “They were very kind, and easy-going, they perhaps seemed less invasive,” she said. “We have no idea what kind of behaviour to expect from this lot.”\n\nView image in fullscreen George Clooney and Amal Clooney on the way to their wedding in Venice in 2014. Photograph: Robino Salvatore/GC Images\n\nThose rumoured to be on the guest list include Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Orlando Bloom and his fiancee, Katy Perry. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, have also reportedly been invited. Bezos and Sánchez had front-row seats at Trump’s inauguration in January, meaning his attendance is highly possible too.\n\nIt is unclear where exactly the wedding will take place, although it could be held at the Doge’s Palace, which was the seat of power during Venice’s years as a republic.\n\nGiusi Giudice, another tour guide, said Venice was used to hosting big events and with everyone earning from the occasion, she was unable to grasp why people were complaining. “Are they just envious of the rich? It didn’t seem to matter with the Clooneys, but here we have a billionaire who is a Trumpian and so is maybe perceived as less pleasant,” she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen George Clooney travelling in a taxi boat a few days before his wedding. Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/Reuters\n\nMatteo Secchi, who leads Venessia.com, a residents’ activist group, said everyone, “whether rich or poor”, was welcome to Venice. “However, what bothers us is that we bend over backwards because a rich guy is coming. We are the city that sells itself to the highest bidder.”\n\nThe social media accounts of Venezia Non è Disneyland (Venice Isn’t Disneyland), a group set up by young Venetians with the aim of sensitising visitors to the city, were filled with comments in response to the Bezos nuptials, with one person joking that tariffs should be imposed on weddings in Europe. “We are waiting for more details before making an official comment,” said one of the activists from the group. “But the city hosted Pope Francis [last year]. Therefore I think we can tolerate this kind of wedding too.”",

        "title": "Off-season: has The White Lotus become a letdown?",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Over three seasons, The White Lotus, HBO’s acclaimed limited series-turned-anthology, has specialized in a particular type of scene: a group of American characters on vacation abroad – always rich and usually white, as per the real patrons of international luxury resorts – engage in conversation with the veneer of politeness but intent to draw blood. None of the players are considered “good” – in the world of the show, not too far removed from ours, to be rich enough to vacation at the White Lotus implies some level of moral rot that blossoms like black mold – but one has leverage over the other in the small-scale arena of taste. Think Sydney Sweeney’s terrifyingly gen Z dismissal of Alexandra Daddario’s journalist in season one, or Aubrey Plaza’s blase assurance that she “doesn’t watch Ted Lasso” in season two. Though distinct from its viral moments – “these gays, they’re trying to murder me” rightfully lives on and on – these cringe-inducing send-ups of the privileged’s code of conduct are the engine of the show.\n\nYet it took until the third episode of this season, set in Thailand and maintaining the vague whodunnit setup of the first two, for the set-up to finally click. Three childhood friends now in their 40s – Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), Laurie (Carrie Coon) and Kate (Leslie Bibb), all bottle blondes simultaneously entreating and competing with each other – are having dinner at the hotel’s restaurant, one of the show’s consistent set pieces. LA-based Jaclyn and New York resident Laurie press Kate, who lives in Austin and is the least self-absorbed friend to date, about the fact that she regularly goes to church with “conservative” people. Wait … she didn’t vote for Trump, did she? “Are we really going to talk about Trump tonight?” Kate replies, eyes crinkling, lips pursed in a smize universally recognized as the suburban white woman’s sign of judgment.\n\nIt’s a serrated, loaded exchange familiar to anyone who’s attended a dinner party outside of New York or LA in the past year; creator Mike White is the star student of human denial and delusion, and of white women’s foibles in particular. It was the first moment I felt the show’s signature bite: the hair-bristling, too-close-to-home dialogue that has become White’s signature. And it stood in noticeable contrast with the rest of the season, which has spun its wheels around a repetition of theme that has grown stale. Once again, The White Lotus revolves around a cast of miserable rich people: the aforementioned friends; an insular UNC-Duke family with the douchiest eldest son of all time (a too-good Patrick Schwarzenegger); and a sourpuss rich floater up to no good (Walton Goggins) and his younger girlfriend (Aimee Lou Wood). And once again, all hijinks, entanglements, betrayals and misunderstandings will culminate in the violent death of someone at the resort.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: HBO\n\nBut whereas previous outings conveyed strains of delusion with clear visual motifs – the self-justifying allegiance to wealth and status rotting like Hawaiian fruit in the season one title sequence, the wandering eyes and creeping lust of season two in Sicily – season three has an emptier stare. It has interstitials of a churning sea, a lush jungle, a Buddhist temple conveying … trouble in paradise?\n\nThe show, also directed by White, is still gorgeous to look at. It’s still achieved moments of appointment television virality – Parker Posey’s extravagant North Carolina accent (Piper, nooooaaughh!”), pissing off Duke University, the incest storyline. It’s sticking to the form, playing the hits, but to diminishing results. Three seasons in, The White Lotus finds itself in a similar position to its oft-compared prestige HBO brethren Succession, another satire of wealth and privilege (though of the most extreme kind) that found itself stuck in a rut in its penultimate season, the same characters cycling through the similar beats and always landing in misery, thus continually lessening the stakes. The White Lotus’s characters are new, with a few nagging exceptions (does anyone want Tanya’s sinister ex Greg back?), and its locale far from Hawaii or Sicily, but its players sub into the same game with the same result: rich and unhappy, doomed to be themselves.\n\nWhite billed this season as exploring eastern spirituality – or, more pointedly, white westerners’ Orientalist conceptions of spiritual enlightenment in Thailand. And while there are hints of it: Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) naively committing to a year in a Buddhist monastery to escape her family, Goggins’s Rick admitting his revenge plot to healer Amrita (Shalini Peiris) in a confession so bald I thought it had to be a joke. But any statement on foreigners’ attraction to eastern religion takes a backseat to the machinations of a mystery with minimal dramatic engine; complicated whodunnit with a dose of financial crime is not White’s strong suit as a writer, and I mean that as a general compliment.\n\nAnd the show’s operating logic for locals – embodying the attitude of the guests by keeping them mostly tangential and outside the frame unless directly related to the action – was, I’d argue, justifiable for the first two seasons, and sputtering in this one. Tayme Thapthimthong’s sweet but simple-minded security guard Gaitok acts purely as a sympathetic plot mover. Why cast Blackpink’s Lisa, one of the most popular and charismatic pop performers in the world, yet barely feature her? (It should be noted that the series was made in conjunction with Thailand’s ministry of tourism.)\n\nThe stasis – the staff used, the guests using in a vicious cycle – has the feel not of satire but, in its third outing, a sitcom of self-repeating structure. Or, as Slate’s Sam Adams argued, a slasher movie, with every character set for self-inflicted, blindspot-ridden downfall other than Natasha Rothwell’s Belinda, a recurring character given little to do besides maintain connections to prior seasons. As the Final Girl, Belinda remains impervious to The White Lotus’s ethos: a deceptively cynical view on the human capacity for progress, enlightenment or marginal betterment, particularly in the face of potential material sacrifice or social discomfort. In other words, a resistance to change.",

        "content": "At least 144 people have died and 732 have been injured after a powerful earthquake struck Myanmar, killing at least nine more in neighbouring Thailand where a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok collapsed.\n\nThe 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar at 12.50pm local time on Friday at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles). Its epicentre was about 11 miles (17.2km) from Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city.\n\nMin Aung Hlaing, the chief of Myanmar’s junta, said he expected the death toll to rise and urged “any country, any organisation” to help with relief efforts – a rare request from the isolated military government. The junta said blood was in high demand in the worst-affected areas as concerns grew about how rescuers would even reach some parts of a country already enduring a widespread humanitarian crisis.\n\nThai authorities said eight of the nine reported deaths happened after the high-rise building crashed to the ground in the capital. Rescuers are searching for another 81 people trapped in the rubble. Damage was also reported in China.\n\nIn Myanmar, witnesses and local media said people had been killed in the city of Mandalay and in the towns Toungoo and Aungban. Hundreds of casualties were taken to a hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, where injured people were being treated outside because of damage to the building.\n\n1:11 Moment skyscraper under construction collapses in Bangkok after earthquake – video\n\nThe scale of the damage in Myanmar is yet to become clear, though social media footage emerging from central regions has shown many buildings collapsed or damaged.\n\nIn Bangkok, authorities declared the city a disaster area, saying they needed to assess and monitor damaged areas and help people who may still be at risk. People ran out on to the streets in panic, many of them hotel guests in bathrobes and swimming costumes, as water cascaded down from an elevated pool at one luxury hotel. In the northern tourist destination of Chiang Mai, where the power briefly went out, stunned residents also hurried outside, unsure how to respond.\n\n“I quickly rushed out of the shop along with other customers,” said Sai, 76, who was working at a minimart in Chiang Mai when the shop started to shake. “This is the strongest tremor I’ve experienced in my life,” Sai told Agence France-Presse.\n\nMohamed Riyas, the regional director of the International Rescue Committee, said the earthquake’s impact was likely to be severe and could displace thousands of people, leaving them in need of food, shelter and medical aid.\n\n“We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake, as communication network lines are down and transport is disrupted,” he added. “The damage to infrastructure and homes, loss of life, and injuries sustained by communities affected should not be underestimated.”\n\nThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, offered his condolences and said regional networks were mobilising to help those in need.\n\nMyanmar’s junta, which has lost swathes of territory to armed groups, declared a state of emergency across the six worst-affected regions. As well as the call for international aid, state TV made a domestic appeal for medical supplies and blood donations because of what it said were “so many” injuries in three urban centres.\n\nThe quake will further stretch Myanmar’s ruling military. The anti-junta militias, known as the people’s defence forces, said their troops would provide humanitarian help.\n\nFootage reportedly taken inside Mandalay airport showed people racing to safety through dusty hallways, the floor scattered with ceiling panels. The videos, published by local media, show panicked people crouching on the floor outside the airport for safety.\n\nView image in fullscreen The damaged emergency department of a hospital in Naypyidaw. Photograph: Sebastien Berger/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA witness in Mandalay, who asked not to be named, said eight people had been killed and others were feared to be trapped after a construction building in Pyigyitagon township collapsed. “The whole of Mandalay city was affected by the earthquake. The rescue teams and hospitals are now overrun. We are managing with the resources we have in the neighbourhood,” they said.\n\nImages published by Khit Thit Media, a news agency based in Myanmar, showed piles of bricks and rubble outside a damaged mosque, also in Mandalay. At least 20 people had died there, it reported, though it was not possible to verify this figure.\n\nAt least three people were also killed after a mosque in Toungoo, in Bago region, partly collapsed, two witnesses told Reuters. “We were saying prayers when the shaking started … Three died on the spot,” said a witness. Local media reported that at least two people died and 20 were injured after a hotel collapsed in Aungban.\n\n0:41 Water cascades down side of high-rise Bangkok hotel during earthquake – video\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization described the earthquake as “a huge event” that posed “a very, very big threat to life and health”, adding: “We’ve activated our logistics hub to look particularly for trauma supplies and things like external fixators, because we expect that there will be many, many injuries that need to be dealt with.”\n\nA programme coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, Marie Manrique, in a briefing from Yangon, said: “Public infrastructure has been damaged including roads, bridges and public buildings. We currently have concerns for large-scale dams that people are watching to see the conditions of them. We anticipate the impact to be quite large.”\n\nMyanmar has been gripped by conflict since the military seized power in February 2021 in a coup widely opposed by the public. It has since launched brutal crackdowns on any forms of opposition, and it is dangerous for journalists to operate inside the country.\n\nA senior UN official warned in November that 2 million people in Myanmar’s Rakhine state could face starvation within months because fierce conflict and trade blockades had led to a “total economic collapse” and the imminent risk of famine.",

        "title": "Two law firms sue after Trump orders target them over links to his opponents",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Two prominent law firms sued the Trump administration on Friday, seeking to block executive orders that would halt the firms’ business with the government and revoke the security clearances of its attorneys.\n\nThe two firms, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, both sued in federal court in Washington and asked a judge to quickly step in and try and halt the orders. They are two of the five firms Trump has targeted with executive orders so far, all in retaliation for employing or representing political enemies. The other firms targeted are Paul, Weiss; Covington & Burling; and Perkins Coie. Until Friday, only Perkins Coie had challenged the order in court and successfully convinced a US district judge in Washington to block it.\n\nThe suits are significant because they come at a moment when there is deep concern that the legal community is not doing enough to push back against Trump’s efforts to target firms. Lawyers and other experts see Trump’s executive orders targeting firms as an anti-democratic program to intimidate adversaries and make it more difficult to challenge him and his administration in court.\n\n“Today, Jenner & Block filed a lawsuit to stop an unconstitutional executive order that has already been declared unlawful by a federal court. We expect to prevail quickly,” the firm said in a statement. “For more than 100 years, Jenner has stood firm and tirelessly advocated for our clients against all adversaries, including against unlawful government action. We once again go to court to do just that. To do otherwise would mean compromising our ability to zealously advocate for all of our clients.”\n\nIn its own suit, lawyers for WilmerHale wrote: “In an unprecedented assault on that bedrock principle, the President has issued multiple executive orders in recent weeks targeting law firms and their employees as an undisguised form of retaliation for representing clients and causes he disfavors or employing lawyers he dislikes.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Jenner & Block LLP’s office in Washington DC in 2020. Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nWilmerHale is being represented by Paul Clement, one of the most prominent conservative lawyers who argues frequently before the US supreme court and served as a solicitor general in the George W Bush administration. “The Order’s declared purpose is to retaliate against WilmerHale – and certain of its clients – for WilmerHale attorneys’ constitutionally protected advocacy in matters that President Trump perceives to be adverse to his personal and/or political interests,” the lawsuit says.\n\nThat concern escalated after Paul, Weiss reached an agreement with the Trump administration to withdraw the executive order against it. Another major firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is reportedly in talks with the Trump administration to avoid having an executive order issued against it, the New York Times reported on Thursday evening.\n\nTrump targeted Jenner & Block over the firm’s employment of Andrew Weissmann, a former prosecutor who worked on Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia during the 2016 campaign. Weissmann has not worked at the firm since 2021 and has been a prominent Trump critic, frequently appearing on television. Trump targeted WilmerHale because it once employed Mueller.\n\nJenner & Block’s suit, filed in the federal district court in Washington DC, details how the order cripples the firm. Over the last five years, 40% of its revenue has come from clients who are government contractors, subcontractors, or affiliated with the government. It also says it harms the firm’s pro-bono practice because it may represent clients and take positions that are at odds with the administration.\n\nLawyers from Cooley LLP, which is representing Jenner & Block, say that the executive order targeting the firm is blatantly unconstitutional.\n\n“The Constitution, top to bottom, protects against such attempts by the government to target citizens and lawyers based on the opinions they voice, the people with whom they associate, and the clients they represent,” the lawsuit says. Creating a list of disfavored law firms, it says, “is anathema to our scheme of ordered liberty”.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "In the wake of the 2021 exit of banjo player (and son of the co-founder of GB News) Winston Marshall, Mumford & Sons have reverted to a trio for their fifth album. Marshall’s departure followed an outcry after he praised “alt-right” agitator Andy Ngo. Yet listening to Rushmere, one wonders whether the world might be a better place had every member of the band felt obliged to quit three years earlier, when news broke that they had hosted Jordan Peterson at their studio.\n\nThere’s a distinct back-to-basics feel to the album, the drearily unappealing (relative) experimentalism of 2018’s Delta ditched in favour of the grating folk hoedowns that first made their name or utterly insipid balladry. The default mood is self-pitying and self-justifying, which is even less attractive than that may sound. “I can’t say I’m sorry if I’m always on the run,” mewls Marcus Mumford on Anchor.\n\nIt’s so miserable that the irritating uptempo songs that recall 2012’s Babel (the title track, Surrender, Carry On) come across as a welcome relief. On the plus side the band have decided not to also resurrect their toffs-cosplaying-farmhands image this time around. Small mercies.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "John Lennon and Paul McCartney met and fell for each other in the summer of 1957. John was 16, Paul 14. Paul came to see John play with his skiffle group, the Quarry Men, at a village fete. Introduced afterwards, they almost immediately formed a connection that went beyond the bounds of normal male friendship.\n\nLennon and McCartney were not sexual partners, as far as we know. But in every other sense, their relationship was a romance: intoxicating, tender and bittersweet. Passionate male friendships like this are rare, but not unique, and a remarkable number of them have changed the world, transforming our ideas about music, art, poetry and human nature. John and Paul were, without knowing it, part of an extraordinary lineage.\n\nAfter impressing John with his guitar-playing and his ability to remember all the words to a song, Paul accepted John’s invitation to join the Quarry Men. The pair began sharing the front of the stage; this was no longer just John’s group. They were fascinated by each other. Paul admired John’s coruscating wit and teddy boy swagger. John admired Paul’s musical abilities and pop star good looks. They made each other laugh more than anyone else they knew.\n\nView image in fullscreen With a little help from my friend … John and Paul’s post-Quarry Men band the Silver Beetles in 1960. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nThey made for an odd couple: John spiky, full of bravado, prone to anger; Paul more temperate and socially subtle. But each thought the other the most brilliant person they knew and they shared a fierce ambition. On weekday afternoons, they would bunk off from school (for Paul) and college (for John) and go to one of their houses to play songs.\n\nAnyone who has shown someone their own creative ideas knows how terrifying it can be. Since they were writing in the idiom of pop, these were songs about feelings – desire, yearning, jealousy. Through music, John and Paul became vulnerable to each other. They allowed the other a glimpse of their soul.\n\nFriends remarked on how John and Paul seemed to be able to read each other’s minds\n\nThe friendship was deepened by shared pain. Paul’s mother, Mary, died from cancer eight months before he met John. About a year afterwards, John’s mother, Julia, died after she was hit by a car. Later, McCartney said that while they didn’t talk much about losing their mothers, just knowing the other had been through the same thing brought them closer. It also reinforced a sense of being different from their peers – different and special.\n\nAs their group, now with different members and a new name, conquered the world, the two remained tight. Friends remarked on how they seemed to be able to read each other’s minds and finish each other’s sentences.\n\nTheir chemistry was inherently volatile. John liked to dominate any group he was in, Paul hated to be pushed around, both were strong-willed. John, whose childhood was marked by abandonment and uncertainty, felt increasingly insecure about the most meaningful relationship in his life. He became more reliant on drugs and found it hard to keep pace with Paul’s relentless productivity.\n\nView image in fullscreen All you need is love … Yoko Ono, John Lennon and Paul McCartney in 1968. Photograph: Roy Cummings/THA/Shutterstock\n\nAs the 60s went on, they began to argue more. The partnership sparked as it splintered; that their tensions were creatively productive is evidenced by the remarkable evolution of the Beatles’ music. But when John and Paul got together with the loves of their lives – Linda Eastman, for Paul, Yoko Ono, for John – they found it hard to sustain their closeness. Finding themselves on opposite sides of an argument over the Beatles’ business affairs, they fell out bitterly.\n\nBoth were disoriented and depressed by the rupture. But even when John recorded a vicious song about his former partner, entitled How Do You Sleep?, their relationship never felt exhausted. During the 70s, they exchanged messages of reconciliation and affection in songs, and gingerly re-established relations in person. While they found it hard to recapture the easy intimacy of their younger days, they never stopped being enthralled by each other.\n\nI don’t think we have ever quite understood the depth, significance or strangeness of this friendship. The two of them are talked about as mates, “brothers”, rivals and enemies. Yet to my mind they don’t fit into any of these prefabricated categories, which perhaps helps to explain why they were able to envisage new possibilities for music. This was an intense, platonic friendship between two men: loving, torrid, explosively creative. Friendships such as this have made a mark on cultural history several times. They seem more likely to be formed in the crucible of an artistic or intellectual revolution. It’s as if the intensity of the personal bond creates a kind of protected space where radical new ideas can incubate.\n\nView image in fullscreen Got to get you into my life … Paul and John in 1964. Photograph: William Vanderson/Getty Images\n\nWilliam Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge met in 1795 when both in their early 20s (Wordsworth was two years older). They bonded over disappointment with the French Revolution and a love of hikes in the English countryside. Temperamentally, they were very different: Coleridge voluble, excitable, a brilliant talker, deeply insecure and prone to depression; Wordsworth more even-keeled, reserved and methodical. But they shared a vaulting ambition to remake the world through poetry.\n\nWordsworth’s steadiness helped ground Coleridge; Coleridge’s enthusiasm energised Wordsworth. They critiqued each other’s work and planned poems. Out of this friendship came Wordsworth’s Lyrical Ballads, Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and a whole new movement in poetry. Over time, Wordsworth grew frustrated with Coleridge’s inability to complete projects and increasing dependence on opium. Coleridge felt judged and constrained by Wordsworth’s more disciplined approach, both to life and to poetry.\n\nThey fell out badly after Coleridge found out that Wordsworth had criticised his character to their friend Thomas De Quincey. While they reconciled somewhat in later years, they never regained their former intimacy. By the 1830s, they could meet cordially, but the bright flame of their early friendship was gone. Coleridge never really got over the rupture, continuing to process it in his writing until his death in 1834.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But perhaps the closest analogy to John and Paul comes not from the arts but the social sciences. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky met in 1969 at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, forming the most productive partnership in the history of psychology (a story told in Michael Lewis’s book The Undoing Project). Their work revolutionised multiple fields, from economics to medicine, challenging fundamental assumptions about human rationality and decision making.\n\nThey were very different: Kahneman self-doubting, pessimistic and quiet; Tversky confident and quick-witted. But their communion transcended these differences in personality. They would shut themselves away for hours before emerging with groundbreaking insights into decision making and judgment, often without being able to remember who had contributed what.\n\nView image in fullscreen This boy … Paul and John in 1963. Photograph: Val Wilmer/Redferns/Getty Images\n\nTheir enthusiasm for their ideas couldn’t be separated from their enthusiasm for each other. This was a romance, a mutual absorption. “Their relationship was more intense than a marriage” said Barbara Tversky, Amos’s wife. “Just to be with [Amos],” Kahneman told Lewis. “I never felt that way with anyone else, really. You are in love and things. But I was rapt.”\n\nThe partnership became strained after they moved to North America to work for different universities, putting physical distance between them. Professional acclaim generated competitive tensions, and they had terrible rows over the phone. The friendship endured until Tversky’s death in 1996, but it was frayed.\n\nThere are several examples of intense male friendship in ancient texts. In Homer’s Iliad, Achilles and Patroclus have a bond so profound that when Patroclus dies Achilles is driven to inconsolable grief and murderous rage. In the Bible, the souls of Jonathan and David are said to be “knit together”. When Jonathan dies, David laments: “Your love to me was more wonderful than the love of women.”\n\nThere is a strain of sadness to all these stories. Society finds it hard to categorise passionate male friendships, and the difficulty can be shared by the friends themselves. In Plato’s Symposium, Aristophanes describes how a pair of friends can be “lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy” yet unable to “explain what they desire of one another. For the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of sexual intercourse, but of something else, which the soul of either evidently desires but cannot identify.”\n\nEra-defining partnerships such as John and Paul’s exist in the space our culture struggles to name, neither friends nor lovers. Yet in that nameless space, new worlds are born.\n\nJohn & Paul: A Love Story in Songs by Ian Leslie is published by Faber.",

You can watch it below, and I will bring you all the key lines here. Live Live US vice president JD Vance arrives in Greenland – watch live Share Updated at 14.05 EDT\n\n32s ago 14.23 EDT 'You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,' Vance tells Denmark Vance continues saying that “the story of Greenland over the past 20 years when it comes to security is that we’ve under invested in the infrastructure.” He says when he first made similar comments “there was a lot of criticism from Denmark” for what he says was “saying the obvious, which is that Denmark has not done a good job at keeping Greenland safe.” He dismisses the argument that many Danes lost their lives in the “war on terror” fighting alongside the US, saying that while he “honours the sacrifice of our Danish friends,” he wants to focus on the future. He says: “Recognising that there are important security partnerships in the past does not mean that we can’t have disagreements with allies in the present about how to preserve our shared security for the future, and that’s what this is about. There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue. Our message to Denmark is very simple: you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have under invested in the people of Greenland, and you have under invested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change, and because it hasn’t changed, this is why President Trump’s policy in Greenland is what it is.” Share\n\n4m ago 14.20 EDT Vance directly attacks Denmark for 'not keeping pace' with resources, keeping Greenland safe JD Vance then turns directly against Denmark, saying he wanted to “be honest what failed over the last 20 years to do in some cases,” saying the area is less important, because “allies have not kept up as China and Russia have taken greater and greater interest in Greenland.” “We know that too often our allies in Europe have not kept pace. They haven’t kept pace with military spending. And Denmark has not kept pace in devoting the resources necessary to keep this base, to keep our troops, and in my view, to keep the people of Greenland safe from a lot of very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China and from other nations.” Share\n\n6m ago 14.17 EDT Vance talks about importance of Greenland base Vance starts by talking about the importance of Greenland and this base, as he says: If, God forbid, to my fellow Americans, if a missile was fired from an enemy country or an enemy submarine into the United States, it is the people here before us, who would give notice to our brave men and women further south, in the United States to let people know what was coming, and God willing to try to shoot it down and prepare for it. He says Russia and China and other nations “are taking an extraordinary interest in Artic passageways,” and the US needs to “lead in the Arctic, because we know that if America doesn’t, other nations will fill the gap”. Share Updated at 14.18 EDT\n\n9m ago 14.15 EDT Vance first invites some of the officials to speak alongside him. US energy secretary Chris Wright speaks about “what energy can do” as he talks about the challenges of running a base “in a tough Arctic environment” like this. Senator Mike Lee pays tribute to US personnel deployed to Greenland without their families, saying “what you do here makes us safer.” National security adviser Mike Waltz follows the suit, thanking US personnel for “continuing a tradition of the US military’s presence” here since the second world war.

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Twenty years after Watergate we still do not know the identity of the secret source who gave Bob Woodward, of The Washington Post, information that led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon. But the author, a former colleague of Woodward’s at the Post, reveals something almost as important about the source, which throws new light on an old scandal.\n\nWITH the anniversary of Watergate approaching, one question about the affair remains as haunting today as it was at the time: Who was Deep Throat, the mysterious source within the federal government who repeatedly met The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward in a parking garage in the early morning hours to guide the Post’s inquiries into the scandal, to pass on information about the federal investigation, and to thwart the Nixon Administration's efforts to rein in that investigation?\n\nThe identity of Deep Throat remains a subject of intense public curiosity. A recent book about Watergate, Silent Coup, by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin, shot to the top of best-seller lists in large part because of its speculation (the authors admitted they had no proof) that Alexander Haig, who was Henry Kissinger’s deputy at the National Security Council at the time of the break-in, was at one point Woodward’s prime source. Over the years countless other recognizable names within the Nixon White House have figured in the speculation.\n\nBeyond mere curiosity, the answer to the question is of considerable historical interest. Identifying Deep Throat would clarify our view of the Nixon Administration and would enhance our understanding of the underlying institutional forces at work in Washington during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the common imagination, the executive branch is run by the President, his Cabinet, and his White House advisers. Thus much of the speculation about Deep Throat over the past two decades has focused on known names within Nixon’s White House, such as Haig, the press spokesman Ronald Ziegler, and the White House adviser Leonard Garment. Rarely is it asked whether these people had the regular, immediate access to the federal investigation of Watergate which provided the backdrop to the Post’s stories. Even more rarely is it asked whether White House aides like Haig, Ziegler, and Garment were the sort of people willing to hold 2:00 A.M. meetings in a parking garage, or whether they were able to arrange the circling of the page number 20 of Bob Woodward’s copy of The New York Times, which was delivered to his apartment by 7:00 A.M.—the signal that Deep Throat wanted a meeting.\n\nDuring any Administration, institutions and bureaucracies are powerful entities within themselves, sometimes with more clout than the White House personalities who theoretically govern them. And among these powerful bureaucracies are the U.S. intelligence and investigative agencies: the CIA and the FBI. In what follows I will explore some of these matters. I cannot reveal who Deep Throat was, because I do not know. I do know, however, the part of the government in which Deep Throat worked, and I can speculate with some conviction about what Deep Throat’s institutional motivations may have been.\n\nHoover’s Secrets\n\nThe year 1972 was the most tumultuous one in the history of the FBI. On May 2, J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI, died at the age of seventy-seven. Over a period of nearly five decades he had built up the organization from scratch, had ruled it in an autocratic fashion, and had filled its upper ranks with men acceptable to him.\n\nTo these men of the Bureau, Presidents were temporary and Hoover’s FBI was permanent. Hoover had dealt with and outlasted every President since Calvin Coolidge. He and his associates had fended off the Kennedys and Lyndon Johnson, and they believed they would survive Richard Nixon, too. This was a matter of pride, of virtue: although it occasionally provided a bit of clandestine help to occupants of the Oval Office, the FBI saw itself as fearlessly independent—outside politics and ultimately beyond the control of the White House. Unlike, say, the Justice Department or the State Department, the FBI did not get a new leader with each new President.\n\nThis tradition was suddenly thrown into question with Hoover’s death. Officials at the Bureau believed that Hoover’s successor would be appointed from within their ranks. W. Mark Felt, the FBI’s deputy associate director, the No. 3 man in Hoover's hierarchy, wrote in a 1979 memoir, The FBI Pyramid:\n\nIt did not cross my mind that the President would appoint an outsider to replace Hoover. Had I known this, I would not have been hopeful about the future. There were many trained executives in the FBI who could have effectively handled the job of Director. My own record was good and I allowed myself to think I had an excellent chance.\n\nWhen Hoover died, FBI officials like Felt did not have much time to think. On May 3, while Hoover’s body was lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda, Assistant Attorney General L. Patrick Gray III appeared at FBI headquarters and asked to see Hoover's secret files. FBI officials refused, insisting that there were no such documents, and after a nasty face-off Gray left. A few hours later Gray was appointed by the Nixon Administration to be the FBI’s acting director.\n\nNixon and his aides had many reasons for wanting to appoint an outsider to head the FBI—some of them honorable, some not. They felt, as had some of their predecessors in the White House, that the FBI was too tradition-bound, and badly needed to adopt more-modern law-enforcement techniques. They also wanted the FBI to be subject to much greater political direction from the White House and the Justice Department than had been possible under Hoover.\n\nThe FBI had resisted several law-enforcement and domestic intelligence-gathering initiatives by the Nixon White House, notably the famous “Huston plan”—the effort, led by the White House aide Tom Charles Huston, to expand intelligence-gathering through a network of informants along with a campaign of wiretapping, bugging, mail opening, and burglaries. Moreover, White House officials feared that if the FBI retained the independence it had had under Hoover, it would never go along with the Nixon Administration’s continuing efforts to use the federal bureaucracy to reward friends and punish enemies.\n\nIn short, Hoover’s death presented the Nixon Administration with a long-sought opportunity to gain political control of the FBI. Traumatized by Hoover’s death, and anxious to preserve the Bureau’s traditions, the FBI’s leadership resented and resisted the Administration’s efforts. By coincidence, the Watergate break-in occurred on June 17, less than seven weeks after Hoover’s death and Gray’s appointment. The FBI took charge of the federal investigation at the same time that the Administration was trying to limit its scope.\n\nTherein lies the origin of Deep Throat.\n\nEnter Woodward\n\nWHEN Bob Woodward arrived in the Post newsroom, less than a year before Watergate, he quickly established himself as one of the top investigative reporters on the local staff. Other reporters might spend weeks, months, or even years on a single project (as, indeed, Woodward himself does now). Woodward distinguished himself by delivering stories fast, sometimes coming up with new information on the controversy of the week. I was a Post reporter at the time of his arrival, and because I was covering Washington’s federal courthouse, Woodward and I often worked closely together. We were friends, reporting alongside each other on the Post’s metro staff.\n\nDuring the late winter and early spring of 1972, the story that occupied much of his time was a running local scandal involving corruption within the District of Columbia police department. Some members of the D.C. vice squad had been found to have been involved in gambling and prostitution, and there were allegations that others had ties to narcotics figures. Woodward monitored the developing investigation—reporting, for example, in a front-page story on February 3, “Two grand juries here are conducting separate investigations into police corruption and major drug dealers, it has been learned. Sources say the probes may lead to the most sweeping criminal indictments in the city in recent years.”\n\nThis was a natural subject for a new investigative reporter on the Post’s local staff. Yet in writing about the D.C. police, Woodward happened to step onto one of the main political battlegrounds in the ongoing struggle between the Nixon Administration and the FBI. At that time the District of Columbia Police Department was favored by Nixon and particularly by his Attorney General, John Mitchell. Top FBI officials suspected, rightly, that Nixon and Mitchell would have liked to name the D.C. police chief, Jerry V. Wilson, to be the next FBI director. Wilson’s police force was everything the FBI was not: it espoused a belief in the need for more-progressive law-enforcement techniques, and it got along well with the Administration. The D.C. police hired minority members, women, and even a handful of “Ivy League cops”—young college graduates who were eager to learn about law enforcement at the street level. These personnel practices were intensely mistrusted by the FBI.\n\nIn one particular crisis, the sweeping anti-war demonstrations that had threatened to close down Washington on May 3, 1971, the White House and the Justice Department had worked closely with Wilson's police in arranging the arrest of some 12,000 people.\n\nIn short, the FBI viewed the D.C. police force as an ally of the Nixon Administration and thus an implied rebuke to the Bureau and its independent tradition. The symbolic value of the investigation into police corruption was openly discussed and debated at the time. Here is how Woodward himself put it in an article on January 13, 1972:\n\nBecause Washington is the nation’s capital and since President Nixon has said he wants to make Washington a model city of law enforcement, the allegation of police corruption has political overtones.\n\n\n\nSome investigators say political pressure has been brought to find widespread corruption. They conjecture it is perhaps to discredit the President. On the other hand, some other investigators say pressure has been exerted to not uncover too much and protect the Administration.\n\nOnly days after this story appeared, the White House moved to lend political support to the police department. “President Nixon yesterday opposed any outside investigation of alleged corruption in the metropolitan police department,” the Post reported on its front page. It quoted Egil (Bud) Krogh, the White House adviser responsible for the District of Columbia (and one of the Nixon “plumbers”), as saying that Nixon believed the D.C. police themselves should be allowed to uncover and correct any corruption that might exist.\n\nThe FBI had been in charge of the investigation of the D.C. police, and Woodward would have dealt with FBI officials in the course of his reporting. Then, in mid-May of 1972, with the investigations winding down, the Post's metropolitan staff, and Woodward in particular, shifted their attention to a new story: the attempted assassination of Alabama Governor George Wallace. By this time Woodward was clearly making considerable and frequent use of a source at the FBI.\n\nAs the former Post city editor Barry Sussman has disclosed in his Watergate book, The Great Cover-Up, within hours of the Wallace shooting, when the identity of the assailant was still not publicly known, Woodward volunteered that he had a “friend” who might be able to help. And indeed, on that day and over the following two weeks, working as part of a team of Post reporters, Woodward was able to come up with details about the life and travels of Arthur Bremer, the man who stalked and finally shot Wallace, virtually as soon as FBI investigators uncovered them.\n\nHigh federal officials who have reviewed investigative reports on the Wallace shooting said yesterday that there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Bremer was a hired killer.\n\n\n\nAt least 200 FBI agents still were following leads across the country and have found no indication of a conspiracy in the Wallace shooting, federal sources here in Washington said.... officially the FBI declined to comment on the search.\n\n\n\n[Bob Woodward, May 18. Italics mine.]\n\n\n\nA reliable federal source close to the investigation termed \"incredible\" the picture of Bremer's travels being assembled by federal investigators.\n\n\n\nBremer has been positively placed in the following places....\n\n\n\n[Hedley Burrell and Bob Woodward, May 25.]\n\n\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has finished its investigation into the life and travels of suspect Arthur Herman Bremer and has found no evidence of any conspiracy or accomplices in the May 15 shooting of Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, federal sources said yesterday.\n\n\n\n[Philip McCombs and Bob Woodward, June 3.]\n\nTwo weeks after the last of the above stories on the Wallace shooting, five men were arrested inside the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate. Immediately, on Monday, June 19, Woodward turned to his source at the FBI for help: “Federal sources close to the investigation said the address books contain the name and home telephone number of Howard E. Hunt [sic], with the notations ‘W. House’ and ‘W.H.’” (Bob Woodward and E. J. Bachinski, June 20.)\n\nBy Woodward’s own description, in All the President’s Men, this source was Deep Throat. “It was he who had advised Woodward on June 19 that Howard Hunt was definitely involved in Watergate,” Woodward wrote.\n\nAt the time of the Watergate break-in, of course, “Deep Throat” was not yet the name of a Watergate source but merely the name of a recently released pornographic movie. Rather, during the summer and early fall of 1972, Woodward spoke to me repeatedly of “my source at the FBI,” or, alternatively, of “my friend at the FBI”—each time making it plain that this was a special, and unusually well-placed, source.\n\nWriting much later, in All the President's Men, Woodward noted that “Deep Throat had access to information from the White House, Justice, the FBI, and CRP [Committee for the Re-election of the President]. What he knew represented an aggregate of hard information flowing in and out of many stations.” FBI officials, in their investigations of Watergate, were collecting information about the CRP and the White House. At the same time, they were working with prosecutors at the Justice Department and were trying to deal with, and fend off, efforts by Nixon and his aides to restrict the Watergate investigation.\n\nMy conviction that Woodward’s FBI source was the man later called Deep Throat was buttressed by the following incident. On September 15 the first Watergate indictments were handed down, against the original burglary team. At the time I had just left the Post and was emptying out my Washington apartment before spending a year in Italy. The day after the indictments were handed down, I called Woodward to say good-bye. I raised the subject of the indictments and asked what was new. “I just talked to my friend at the FBI,” Woodward answered. “I think we’re on to a whole new level on this thing.”\n\nIn All the President’s Men, Woodward and Bernstein wrote,\n\nThe day after the indictments were handed down Woodward broke the rule about telephone contact. Deep Throat sounded nervous, but listened as the draft of a story was read to him.... ‘Too soft,’ Deep Throat said. ‘You can go much stronger.’\n\nOn September 18 the Post published the first story broadening the investigation beyond the Watergate break-in. SECRET FUND TIED TO INTELLIGENCE USE, the front-page story said.\n\nTwo of President Nixon’s top campaign officials each withdrew more than $50,000 from a secret fund that financed intelligence gathering activities against the Democrats, according to sources close to the Watergate investigation.\n\n\n\nThe two officials, both former White House aides, are Jeb Stuart Magruder, deputy director of the Committee for the Re-election of the President, and Herbert L. Porter, scheduling director of the committee....\n\nInstitutional Motives\n\nWITH the benefit of hindsight, it becomes abundantly clear why someone at the FBI would have an interest in leaking information about Watergate to The Washington Post. In the very first week after the Watergate arrests, FBI investigators found that the White House was putting obstacles in the way of its investigation of the case. White House counsel John Dean insisted on sitting in on the FBI’s interviews. The Bureau’s efforts to interview witnesses and to obtain various records were being stalled or blocked. L. Patrick Gray, who was working closely with Dean, ordered FBI agents to call off a proposed interview with Miguel Ogarrio, a lawyer whose checks totaling $89,000 had been deposited in the bank account of one of the arrested men; Gray said the interview might jeopardize existing CIA operations in Mexico.\n\nNixon’s White House tapes later demonstrated that, in one of the key acts of the Watergate cover-up, Nixon and his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, had ordered the CIA deputy director, Vernon Walters, to ask the FBI not to pursue its inquiries in Mexico. Of course, FBI officials other than Gray did not know this at the time. All they knew in late June of 1972, little more than a month after Hoover’s death and Gray’s appointment, was that the White House was impeding their investigation. And these White House efforts seemed to validate their worst fear: that the Nixon White House intended to use the FBI for political purposes.\n\nFBI officials were furious. According to Mark Felt, on July 5 three top FBI officials asked for a meeting with Gray to protest White House obstruction of the Watergate investigation. The three were Felt, Charles W. Bates, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's General Investigative Division, and Robert Kunkel, the special agent in charge of the Washington field office, which was conducting the investigation. As Felt recounted in his memoir,\n\n“Look,” I told Gray, “the reputation of the FBI is at stake.... We can’t delay the Ogarrio interview any longer! I hate to make this sound like an ultimatum, but unless we get a request in writing from [CIA] Director Helms to forego the Ogarrio interview, we're going ahead anyway....\n\n\n\n“That's not all,” I went on. “We must do something about the complete lack of cooperation from John Dean and the Committee to Reelect the President. It’s obvious they’re holding back—delaying and leading us astray in every way they can....\n\nInvoking Hoover’s name, Felt made clear that he and his colleagues believed that the FBI’s traditions and its future were at stake:\n\nIn fact, no one could have stopped the driving force of the investigation without an explosion in the Bureau—not even J. Edgar Hoover. For me, as well as for all the Agents who were involved, it had become a question of our integrity. We were under attack for dragging our feet and as professional law enforcement officers we were determined to go on.\n\nFor a senior FBI official like Deep Throat, talking to Woodward and the Post about Watergate was a way to fend off White House interference with the investigation. The contacts with the press guaranteed that information developed by the FBI’s Watergate investigative team would not be suppressed or altered by Nixon Administration officials. And, more broadly, the leaks furthered the cause of an independent FBI unfettered by political control.\n\nCandidates From the FBI\n\nAS I said at the outset, I didn’t know who Deep Throat was. I know from conversation with Bob Woodward at the time only that he was from the FBI.\n\nHe could well have been Mark Felt, who admitted that he harbored ambitions to be the FBI director—not only at the time of Hoover’s death but also in the spring of 1973, when Gray’s nomination as permanent director failed to win confirmation and Nixon named William Ruckelshaus acting director. Felt was known in Washington as a person willing to talk to the press. He has denied that he was Deep Throat. “I never leaked information to Woodward and Bernstein or to anyone else!” he wrote in his 1979 book. Felt retired from the FBI in 1973, not long after Ruckelshaus’s appointment.\n\nPerhaps he was Charles Bates, whose job as assistant director of the General Investigative Division would have given him direct supervisory authority over the police-corruption investigation, over the investigation into Arthur Bremer's shooting of George Wallace, and over the investigation into the Watergate break-in. In the midst of the Watergate investigation Bates asked to be reassigned as special agent in charge of the FBI’s field office in San Francisco, where he later headed the Bureau’s investigation into the kidnapping of Patty Hearst.\n\nPerhaps Deep Throat was Robert Kunkel or one of the other FBI agents in the Washington field office who were working on Watergate. That seems less likely, however. Gray ousted Kunkel from his job and assigned him to be head of the St. Louis office in the middle of Watergate; FBI agents attributed the demotion to Kunkel’s aggressive direction of the Watergate investigation. And the Washington field office didn’t have direct responsibility for the investigation of the Wallace shooting, about which Woodward’s FBI source had proved so helpful.\n\nConceivably, Deep Throat was some other senior FBI official who was keeping track of the Watergate investigation and the Administration’s efforts to thwart it—or acting as a messenger from top officials like Felt and Bates to Woodward.\n\nBy Woodward’s account, in All the President’s Men, Deep Throat passed on most of his crucial information from June of 1972 to early 1973. However, Woodward says in the book that he met with Deep Throat at least once in November of 1973, when his source provided him with some information on the gaps that investigators had found on Nixon’s White House tapes. By that time Felt had officially retired from the FBI, and Bates and Kunkel were out of Washington. Still, all of them would have kept in close touch with the FBI’s Watergate investigators, and would have been in a position to pass on information to Woodward. It is also possible that the FBI official who was Woodward’s original source handed over the mantle of Deep Throat to a successor.\n\nThere has been considerable speculation that Deep Throat never existed, that he must have been either a complete fiction or a composite of several people. My memory of those early months of Watergate is otherwise: that there was a specific individual, from the FBI, and Woodward had special access to him.\n\nWhat seems important, with two decades of hindsight, is that in our national preoccupation with personality and celebrity in the nation’s capital, we have concentrated too much on Deep Throat as an individual and not enough on the underlying bureaucratic forces. To be sure, Deep Throat may have had personal motives for his parking-garage meetings with Woodward. Several top FBI officials, including Felt, hoped to take over Hoover’s job. Moreover, Woodward demonstrated great skill in cultivating and preserving Deep Throat as a source and a friend. But the institutional motivations at work would seem to have been at least as important as the personal interests or idiosyncrasies of an individual source and a newspaper reporter.\n\nAfter Hoover’s death, the FBI faced what its officials felt was a threat to its tradition of independence from political control. Top FBI officials were worried about the impact of Gray’s appointment. And in less than seven weeks, White House interference with the Watergate investigation proved to them that their fears were justified. They responded—as FBI officials had often done during the Hoover era-by going to the press.\n\nAn Ironic Coda\n\nIN the battle over the independence of the FBI there were no unblemished heroes, no white hats. The Watergate investigation demonstrated that the Nixon White House had dishonorable motives for wanting to gain political control over the FBI. Yet the FBI’s motives for seeking to retain its independence were not entirely pure either. Under Hoover the Bureau had become an autocratic institution, mistrustful of change and modernization, secretly engaging in a number of activities for which it had no legal authorization.\n\nWatergate inspired a series of congressional investigations of abuses by the FBI. These investigations focused on such activities as the bugging of Martin Luther King, Jr.; the counterintelligence program to disrupt political groups on the left and the right; and a pattern of illegal break-ins and burglaries.\n\nIrony is the lifeblood of history. And so, throughout the late 1970s L. Patrick Gray, who had been assigned by Richard Nixon to take political control of the FBI, and Mark Felt, who had fought to resist that control, found themselves joined together in a prolonged legal battle to fend off prosecution by the Justice Department for approving illegal break-ins at the homes of members of the Weathermen underground organization and their families and friends. The government eventually dropped charges against Gray. But in 1980 Felt and another of Hoover's top aides were convicted of conspiracy to violate civil rights. Soon after taking office President Ronald Reagan granted the two men a pardon, claiming that they had “acted on high principle to bring an end to the terrorism that was threatening our nation.”\n\nThus, in this epic institutional battle between the Nixon Administration and the post-Hoover FBI, neither side won. Deep Throat’s secret meetings with Woodward helped, in the long run, to preserve the FBI’s investigation of Watergate and thus ultimately to force Nixon to resign. But whereas Nixon came out a loser, so did the FBI, which found itself unable to preserve the independence and the freedom from scrutiny which it had long enjoyed under Hoover.",

Sign up for it here.\n\nI.\n\nIn my childhood, even before my education had been begun, I was allowed to take part in the elaborate ritual which, in those days, marked the making of a fruitcake at Christmas time. Although I was blind, deaf, and speechless, the thrill of the occasion communicated itself to me. There were all sorts of pungent and fragrant ingredients to collect and prepare — orange and lemon peel, citron, nuts (which had to be cracked), apples, currants, raisins (which had to be seeded), and a host of other things. The family encouraged me to assist in these preparations, for they discovered that this was one means of keeping me, at least temporarily, out of mischief; and I, for my part, was just as eager to help, because I was always permitted to claim my wages in raisins.\n\nAll in all, this concoction of a fruitcake was a long and complicated task. If there had been some oversight in the preliminary planning and an important ingredient was missing, someone had to make a trip to town to fetch it. While the mixing process was being carefully attended to, a roaring fire was built in the stove. At last, when everything was ready and the fire was giving off just the right degree of heat, the great pan was placed reverently in the oven. The climax of the ritual was now at hand. The temperature had to be maintained for several hours with the utmost precision, and everybody had to walk about on tiptoe lest some unguarded step shake the floor and cause the precious batter, swelling with the heat, to fall. In the end, if all went well, we were rewarded with a very miracle of a fruitcake, without which Christmas would not have been Christmas.\n\nTo-day this ritual, so delightful to children, so exacting to the mothers who superintended it, is fast becoming a lost art. The modern housewife has only to go to her compact kitchen cabinet to assemble the ready-prepared ingredients, even to shelled nuts. If one should be lacking, she telephones to the corner grocery. The cake almost bakes itself in an automatically regulated gas stove, while the lady of the house goes about her other duties. Or perhaps she achieves her fruitcake by buying it in a tin container at her grocer’s. Whether she bakes it or buys it, her labor in either case is simple and quick compared to what it was even a few years ago.\n\nThe same thing may be said of almost every other phase of household work. Our grandmothers had to perform a tremendous amount of dreary drudgery in managing their homes. They were kept busy from morning till night, for those were the days when a woman’s work was never done. Since then, however, the machine age has come upon us, transforming the home no less surely than the factory. The housewife of to-day finds that many heavy responsibilities which she would have had to assume in any other age, such as the baking of bread and the weaving of cloth) have been lifted from her, and scores of other tasks which still remain in her province have been so simplified that they can now be performed with a great saving of time and effort. Electricity and gas and innumerable mechanical devices have reduced household labor to a fraction of its former burden. In consequence, the modern woman enjoys a degree of leisure which her grandmother could hardly have dared to dream of.\n\nWhether women are using their newfound leisure to its full advantage is a debatable question, and one which I shall not attempt to discuss here. The point that I want to emphasize is that they have it — and they have it because of these countless machines and clever contrivances which have been invented to save them time and labor.\n\nVideo: “Put Your Husband in the Kitchen”: An Animated Excerpt\n\nThis, of course, is a very familiar observation, and I claim no credit for originality in mentioning it. But recently, as I was turning over in my mind the tragic muddle of present economic conditions, it suddenly occurred to me that this commonplace is not nearly as hackneyed as it may seem. Few of us seem to have grasped the significance of this new leisureliness which has come to grace our households. As a matter of plain fact, what women have done with labor-saving machinery in the home is exactly the reverse of what men have done with it in their factories and offices. The captain of industry seizes upon improved tools as means to increase production, and now he finds the channels of trade clogged with more goods than can be sold; his wife uses them to produce leisure, of which she can never have too much.\n\nThe average woman is not very familiar with the complexities of economics, but it seems to me that she has ordered her household economy upon a more solid basis than that upon which men have arranged the affairs of their larger world. In industry, the amazing increase in the use of labor-saving machinery has brought about overproduction, unemployment, and widespread suffering. Either women are wiser, or they have a sounder instinct for economics. At any rate, they use labor-saving devices for the heretical purpose of saving labor, and in doing so they have, I think, demonstrated in their homes a practical object lesson in economics which their husbands would do well to master. While theorists are still searching for the causes of the depression, and politicians remain at loggerheads in their effort to conjure up remedies, I am tempted to think that the perplexed businessman might discover a possible solution of his troubles if he would just spend a few days in his wife’s kitchen.\n\nLet us see what would happen if he did.\n\nII.\n\nMr. Jones, let us say, is a modern captain of industry. Mrs. Jones is an intelligent woman who knows more than the average about economics, and has the knack of seeing things through to their essentials. She had often discussed business problems with her husband, and had endeavored without success to win him to her point of view. At last she decided to try an experiment. She persuaded her husband that he owed it to humanity to demonstrate the correctness of his ideas by applying them to the home — the one field which men had not yet touched with their organizing genius. Mr. Jones accepted the challenge and agreed to serve for a term as cook, maid, and household manager. He promised to see what improvements he could effect by directing all domestic activities in precisely the same way that he conducted his own business.\n\nMr. Jones had grown up on a farm. The chores that fell to his lot as a boy made him familiar with the drudgery of household work in former days. Although he was vaguely aware that the home had kept pace with the mechanical age, he did not know what a startling revolution had taken place in the economy of the household until he surveyed his wife’s model kitchen, with its gas range, its dishwashing machine, its electric mixer, and its various other labor-saving appliances. He investigated the interior of the compact kitchen cabinet, containing all sorts of prepared foods. He was particularly impressed by the special cake flour and the shelled nuts.\n\n‘Ah, the wonders of science and modern efficiency!’ he said to himself. ‘I remember the fine nut cakes my mother used to make. What a job it was in those days! But now, with all these prepared ingredients, with the electric mixer and the automatically regulated gas range, I ought to be able to make ten cakes in less time and with less trouble than my mother required to make one in her primitive household.’\n\nSo, true to the ideas which had made him a captain of industry, Mr. Jones proceeded to transform potential power into actuality. When the family assembled at the dinner table that evening, the new household manager could hardly restrain his enthusiasm. Laughingly, he said to his wife: ‘See now, Mary, what I have done. Ten cakes. Ten! When you were running the house we had only one, or two at most. Ah, the logical, orderly, efficient brain of a man is needed even in the kitchen, that sacred province of woman. In one day I have revolutionized the business of cooking, and have put it on a sound basis.’\n\nThe cakes were good, and the family ate almost a whole one with relish. They were persuaded to finish it. But there were still nine left. By good salesmanship the industrialist-turned-cook induced the family to eat another, which they did to please him, but they had no relish for it. At this point Mr. Jones found himself confronted with the same problem which he had to face every day in his business — he would have to sell more. Inventory would have to be reduced, unit costs slashed. That could be done only by stimulating demand and increasing consumption. So he employed the cash rebate system, offering small William a dime to place his order for a large section of the third cake. William saw that it was a consumer’s market; he knew that such wonders are unnatural and impermanent, and could not resist stocking up. In the end, by using every known trick of the salesman’s art, Mr. Jones coaxed, wheedled, and bribed the family to dispose of the third cake. By this time everybody had arrived at a stage of acute discomfort and complete indifference to further entreaties, and he recognized the symptoms of a saturated market.\n\nThat night the family physician kept busy ministering to varying degrees of indigestion from mild to acute. The care with which Mrs. Jones had nurtured the family stood them in good stead, however, and all were fairly well recovered by morning.\n\nAt breakfast Mrs. Jones said to her husband: ‘Of course you realize the doctor’s fees will have to come out of your budget. It was all your fault.’\n\n‘But I have no reserves set for that,’ replied Mr. Jones. ‘You know that before we changed places I always paid the doctor. His bill shouldn’t be charged against the household budget.’\n\n‘Just the same,’ said Mrs. Jones, ‘I’m afraid you’ll have to add it to your production costs. Then next time you’ll know better than to glut the market.’\n\nFor once Mr. Jones had nothing to say, and his wife continued: ‘Fortunately, we shall not want any more cake for a long time to come. But when we do, you can bake ten, if you must, and then throw away nine. You can’t object to that. I understand that such methods are common in your economic world. “Maintaining the market,” — isn’t that what you call it? It won’t be the first time food has been destroyed to maintain the market. And, of course, you manufacturers are constantly producing goods that go to waste because of lack of demand. So I shouldn’t dare suggest that you bake only one cake merely because that is all we need. That would be heresy. It would be inefficient. It would be criminal failure to take advantage of “plant capacity.” The gas stove will easily hold ten cakes, and the same gas that will bake one will bake the others too. The electric mixer also represents an investment. You should not let it stand idle, for the overhead will ruin us. So go ahead with your plans, John. I just know you are going to do remarkable things in increasing and cutting unit costs — but don’t forget to dispose of your surplus.’\n\n‘Getting sarcastic, aren’t you?’ replied Mr. Jones. ‘Well, perhaps I did make a mistake. Anyway, let’s forget want to be helpful, tell me do with these seven cakes from yesterday. It seems a pity to throw them away.’\n\nMrs. Jones was helpful. She took the remaining cakes in her car and distributed them among her friends. She knew that it would not be long before her friends would bring her a few glasses of jelly or some other homemade delicacy in return.\n\nMr. Jones did not like his wife’s solution of the problem, but he was not in a position to protest. Such friendly bartering of goods struck him as very primitive, a reversion to the economic methods of savage tribes. He thought of economics in terms of money, vast organizations, complicated financial structures, stocks and bonds, banking and credits, and a hundred and one other intricate devices. All these he contemplated with pride, as evidence of the lofty plane upon which our civilization moves. But in this imposing forest he lost sight of the trees. He forgot that the sole purpose of any economic system is to facilitate the manufacture and exchange of the necessities and luxuries of life, in order that life may be made easier and finer. Like many another captains of industry, he had come to consider business, not as a means toward this end, but as an end in itself. No wonder he was having difficulty accommodating himself to the elementary principles of household economy, the sole purpose of which is to promote the welfare and happiness of the family.\n\nIII.\n\nWhen Mrs. Jones returned from her little tour of barter, her husband was busy with the vacuum cleaner and was putting the finishing touches on the living-room rug.\n\n‘Why,’ she cried, ‘you’ve practically completed the cleaning! What will you do then? With a broom it would have taken you four times as long. Here you’ve used the vacuum cleaner only a few minutes, and you’re almost through. Then the machine will have to lie idle until to-morrow. Heavens, you could have cleaned a house twice as large! I suppose there is really nothing for us to do but buy a larger house. It is really a shame to waste all the time that is saved by this electric sweeper. Then there is the investment in the machine; you can’t afford to let it stand idle. That is not efficiency. Yes, I can see that the vacuum cleaner will have to give a better account of itself in future. It must be used more, and the only way to make sure of that is to get a larger house.’\n\n‘Have you gone completely out of your senses?’ asked the astonished Mr. Jones.\n\n‘Not at all,’ replied his wife. ‘I’m just beginning to understand your way of looking at things. We must go in for “plant expansion” — isn’t that what you business men call it? We must realize the productive potentialities of our vacuum cleaner. It cries out for new carpets to sweep, and of course the new house will need lots of new rugs. Just think, John! We shall immediately create a vast, untouched market for the services of our electric sweeper. How foolish I have been all these years! How inefficient! Why, that silly old vacuum cleaner has been in the closet, for years, idle practically all of the time except for a few minutes a day, and I never realized until now how wasteful it was.’\n\n‘Please, Mary, don’t be ridiculous,’ Mr. Jones snapped.\n\n‘Oh, was I being ridiculous? Why, I thought I was following your business logic. Have you forgotten the time, two years ago, when your foreman invented that labor-saving device which made it possible for a man to tend two machines instead of one? You expanded the plant, put in twice as many machines, and doubled production. You said then that it wouldn’t be long before I could have a new car and a new fur coat and all sorts of things, because profits would be more than doubled. Production was doubled, just as you planned, but at the end of the year you had half of the goods in the warehouse and you closed the factory while the machines and the new plant “ate their heads off,” as you so quaintly put it.’\n\nMrs. Jones smiled sweetly, but Mr. Jones stammered and rushed away to his new sanctum — the kitchen.\n\nEarly that afternoon when Mrs. Jones came downstairs on her way to a meeting of her church club, she found her husband seated before the living room fireplace smoking a fragrant cigar and contentedly immersed in a book. He looked up guiltily as she entered.\n\n‘Is something wrong, John?’ she asked. ‘It isn’t at all like you to be wasting time in this fashion. Surely you don’t sit in your office and read a book in the middle of the afternoon! Even when you have nothing to do, you at least try to appear busy.’\n\n‘I won’t need to start dinner for another hour,’ Mr. Jones explained, ‘and everything else has been attended to.’\n\n‘Have you finished the luncheon dishes? Yes, I suppose you have. It takes very little time with the new dishwasher. But, really, I don’t know how to suggest making efficient use of the time you save. I don’t know how to provide more raw material for a machine which transforms soiled dishes into clean ones. I hope you won’t be driven to the extremity of having to invent a dish-soiling machine so that the dishwasher may be kept operating at capacity.’\n\nMr. Jones’s cigar turned bitter in his mouth and he lost interest in his book, but his wife hurried out the door and went her way.\n\nIV\n\nWhen Mrs. Jones returned from her club meeting she brought news cheer her husband. The women of the church were to give a large charity dinner, and Mr. Jones saw in this an opportunity to demonstrate his methods of efficiency, organization, mass production in a real test. He sprang to the telephone and immediately began placing orders for hams and chickens, jellies and pickles, and scores of other things that would be needed to feed the hundred people who were to be invited.\n\nThat evening Mrs. Smith came in to talk over arrangements for the dinner, but Mrs. Jones referred the embarrassed caller to the new director of cuisine and household economics. Mr. Jones was pleased to have this chance to spread his gospel of efficiency, and he launched at once upon a technical outline of his plans for preparing the whole affair according to the most improved factory methods.\n\n‘I am sure,’ he concluded, ‘that by proper organization and mass production I can bring the unit cost per dinner down to a record minimum. I think I can guarantee that the cash contribution from each member of the club will be smaller than has ever before been possible.’\n\nMrs. Smith interrupted him. ‘But, Mr. Jones,’ she said, ‘your proposal would upset all our arrangements. You see, each of our members has her own specialty to supply. Every summer when I put up jelly, for example, I always set aside a few extra jars for the church dinner. Mrs. Doe does the same with chowchow and pickles. Mrs. Roe supplies chickens from her own barnyard, and Mrs. Franklin furnishes potatoes from her farm. Very little actual money goes into the dinner. Each of us donates what she is best equipped to give.’\n\n‘You see, John,’ spoke up Mrs. Jones with an indulgent smile, ‘none of us tries to capture the whole dinner market. We plan and cooperate. We don’t go about it as you manufacturers do when a new field is opened up, and every manufacturer sets out to capture the market in toto. If we did that, we should find ourselves spreading a dinner for a thousand people instead of a hundred. Mrs. Roe might make a full supply of potato salad, while Mrs. Doe, convinced that her own potato salad was far better, might make another full supply and place it in competition with Mrs. Roe’s product. Then we should have overproduction, and all of us would lose by it. We avoid this by estimating our market as closely as possible, and we plan and cooperate to supply the demand. I suppose, John, that this will strike you as very primitive indeed, but somehow it seems to accomplish our purpose with a minimum of waste.’\n\nIn the end Mr. Jones had nothing for it but to sneak away to the telephone and cancel the orders he had placed.\n\nThereafter he seemed a much chastened man. He did not again make himself the butt of his wife’s irony by producing more things than his family could use, just to demonstrate the efficiency of his household machinery. In a few days he took to spending an occasional afternoon at his club. He began playing golf, and devoted many of his leisure hours to exploring his rather large library, which had hitherto been merely an unused collection of books. He found himself becoming interested in all sorts of fascinating subjects. He was really enjoying himself immensely, although he had a guilty look on his face whenever Mrs. Jones caught him at any of these diversions during working hours.\n\nOne day she said to him, ‘Perhaps you can see now, John, that the purpose of labor-saving devices is really to save labor, so that more time can be devoted to pleasant and stimulating living.’\n\nNot long after this, Mr. Jones decided that his business again required his attention. His wife is convinced that he returned to his office with a few elementary but enlightening lessons in economics well mastered.\n\nV.\n\nNo one, of course, would act as foolishly in the realm of household economics as did this mythical Mr. Jones, but there are many Mr. Joneses who have acted no less foolishly in their own sphere of large-scale industry, expanding plants and piling up goods with complete disregard of market demand. It may be argued that the parallel I have drawn is not a fair one because the family unit is so small and static that its requirements can be easily gauged, while there is no element of competition in supplying these requirements. But the nation, after all, is only the sum of these small units, and with proper cooperation it should not be impossible to estimate, within certain limits, the amount of goods the nation needs.\n\nHere, of course, arises the question of whether we are at present suffering from overproduction or underconsumption — the question, in short, of purchasing power. This is a large subject which I do not have space to deal with in this article, but I hope to write about it some other time. The only point I want to make here is this: that it is about time for us to begin using our labor-saving machinery actually to save labor instead of using it to flood the nation haphazardly with surplus goods which clog the channels of trade. That will presuppose, to be sure, some cooperative effort to determine the needs of the people and to produce accordingly.\n\nIn the allegory of Mr. Jones, perhaps Mrs. Jones came off better than she should. She has obtained leisure, certainly, but it is doubtful whether the hundreds of thousands of Mrs. Joneses throughout the land are making the best use of the new wealth of hours which the labor-saving devices in their homes have made possible. But at least the opportunity is there. Women have won the first skirmish, whereas in the industrial world — the world of men — the machine is battering at the very livelihood of our beleaguered people. If we are to win this larger battle, we must adopt a new collective view of the machine and the complex economic structure which has been erected upon it.\n\nI am convinced that the machine has taken something out of life. We have paid, and are still paying, a great price for the benefits it has given us. But the fault lies with us. We have not used it properly. If the progress of the mechanical age should suddenly cease now, I should say that its disadvantages had outweighed its benefits. But further developments are certain to come. We cannot now throw the machine overboard. It is with us to stay, and our task is to turn it to our proper need. In the machine, rightly controlled, lies the hope of reducing human drudgery to the minimum — not merely that we may be free of drudgery, but that every individual may have the opportunity for a happy life, for a leisure which, under wise guidance, may lead to mental and spiritual growth.\n\nI do not set myself up as an economist, but from my detached position I have tried to examine the whole problem from a humanitarian and common-sense point of view. It evident to me, as it must be to thinking people, that the manufacture and exchange of goods constitute the preponderant influences in modern life. That is a false emphasis. Now, at I we have an opportunity gradually to shift that emphasis by using laborsaving machinery for its ostensible purpose of saving labor. This will mean a reduction in the hours of toil for the great masses of the people. The trend is already in that direction, as an emergency measure, and I am convinced that the pressure toward this end will outlast the emergency, for it is a logical result of the flowering of the mechanical age. This new orientation is by no means impossible. If I thought it were, I should lose my faith in humanity.\n\nAfter all, is it too much to expect that our ingenuity can reorganize our economic system to take advantage of the machines which we have created? It is largely up to the men — the statesmen and the captains of industry; and, if they are unable to accomplish the task, we women shall have to send them into the kitchen for a few lessons in common-sense economics.",

        "title": "Politicians Think Voters Are Dumb. Are They Right?",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nAcross 11 different democracies, politicians share a shockingly pessimistic view: They believe that their voters are uninformed, unreasonable, and short-sighted. In a paper recently published by the American Political Science Review, the University of Calgary political scientist Jack Lucas and his co-authors surveyed 12,000 citizens and conducted face-to-face interviews with nearly 1,000 elected officials. In this wide-ranging study of countries including Australia, Denmark, Germany, and Canada, the researchers find that elected officials and voters diverge wildly. Unlike politicians, voters believe themselves to be policy-oriented, politically knowledgeable, and engaged.\n\nOn today’s episode of Good on Paper, I speak with Lucas about how this research reveals a striking divide between democratically elected officials and the voters who put them into office. Even in countries with extremely varied political systems and demographics, this difference persists, suggesting that something fundamental to democracies—at least modern ones—is creating this division. Tellingly, Lucas’s research shows that senior politicians tend to be more cynical about voters than junior ones, suggesting that expecting the worst from voters doesn’t carry an electoral penalty.\n\nDespite this, Lucas is an optimist:\n\n“I’m more on the ‘voters aren’t that dumb’ side of the spectrum,” Lucas tells me, acknowledging that this puts him in the minority among political scientists. “There is pretty good evidence that at least on issues that voters care a lot about, they’re thinking carefully about policy.”\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: When Donald Trump said, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters,” he was ostensibly making a joke about the loyalty of his followers. But another way to read it is that it is a revealing comment on how he thinks about voter psychology—that they care little about personal virtue and are with him for his other qualities.\n\nDeciphering voter psychology can feel like an insurmountable exercise. If you talk to individual people about why they voted for their chosen candidate, their answers range from reasonable to incomprehensible.\n\nIn a new paper, the University of Calgary political scientist Jack Lucas and his co-authors investigate this through survey evidence. Their interests lie in both how voters see themselves and, crucially, how politicians see their voters.\n\nIn face-to-face interviews with almost a thousand elected politicians across 11 countries, as well as survey data from over 12,000 citizens, the paper seeks to map how voters think across several key dimensions. Unfortunately, none of that data includes the United States, for reasons we’ll get into, but it’s still relevant to understanding the American electorate.\n\n[Music]\n\nDemsas: The paper seeks to understand whether voters vote based on policy or identity. Are they short-term or long-term oriented? Do they tend to be single-issue or multi-issue voters? Are they pocketbook oriented, or do they vote based on their perception of the national economy? Do they make decisions based on past performance and behavior, or on what they expect to see happen?\n\nMy name’s Jerusalem Demsas. I’m a staff writer at The Atlantic, and this is Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. To tease out what we know about these questions, I asked Jack to come on the show and give me a better sense of voter psychology.\n\nJack, welcome to the show.\n\nJack Lucas: Thank you. Thanks for having me.\n\nDemsas: So a recurring question on this show, and unfortunately in real life, is: Are voters dumb?\n\nWhat’s your take? Are voters dumb?\n\nLucas: Well, this is the age-old debate in theories of voting behavior. There are a number of competing theories, as you know, and one of the things we’re looking into in this paper is to try and understand where politicians stand on this question. But if you ask me where I stand on this question, I guess I’m more on the “voters aren’t that dumb” side of the spectrum.\n\nDemsas: It’s a bold claim to make right now. (Laughs.)\n\nLucas: Yes, I know. (Laughs.) It’s tough times for those of us who believe policy voting is a thing.\n\nBut I think that arguments that come out of the democratic realist kind of tradition and the work of Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels in their book, Democracy for Realists, really poses an important challenge to any theories of policy voting that we have to grapple with, and there’s a lot in there that’s, I think, quite persuasive.\n\nBut I also think that when we look at the wider picture of examples, where we can really tease apart whether people are voting on the basis of policy versus whether they’re voting on the basis of things like social identity or irrational retrospection, there is pretty good evidence that, at least on issues that voters care a lot about, they’re thinking carefully about policy.\n\nSo I don’t want to go all the way down the road to say, you know, I’m hard-core spatial voting, and nothing else ever. But there’s, I think, some pretty good evidence to suggest that voters aren’t perhaps as dumb as they seem, if the only thing you look at is the, kind of, democratic-realist theory of voting and voting behavior.\n\nDemsas: And can you define “spatial voting” for us?\n\nLucas: Yes, absolutely. We’re right, straight into the jargon. I apologize.\n\nDemsas: No, you’re good.\n\nLucas: The idea of spatial voting is that all of us carry around in our heads a bundle of policy preferences. You can summarize that bundle of policy preferences with something called an “ideal point,” but this is really just kind of where you live on the left–right spectrum.\n\nAnd when you vote in an election, spatial voting theory suggests that you look around at the candidates or the parties; you identify the one who is closest, whose policy promises are closest to your own ideal point, your preferred bundle of policies; and you support that candidate or party. That’s sort of the basic logic of spatial voting. And it’s prospective, so people are looking forward at the candidates’ and the parties’ policy commitments, and they’re voting on that basis of future promises. And it’s policy oriented because you’re not voting on the basis of how well things are going in your life or your social identity or any other kinds of things like that. You’re really voting on the basis of your policy preferences. So that’s sort of the theoretical arguments at the heart of spatial voting.\n\nDemsas: So you’ve sort of alluded to this, but there’s a variety of axes on which you could be more of, like, a democratic optimist versus a democratic realist. Though, in my head, maybe realists, I would classify them as pessimists. And there’s whether you’re looking forward (you’re prospective) or you’re looking backwards (you’re retrospective). Are you actually voting on a specific issue, like a single-issue voter? Are you a multi-issue voter? There’s just, like, lots of different ways that you can evaluate whether you’re kind of fitting into one of these two camps.\n\nYou’re kind of an outlier, I would say, in political science. Maybe I’m wrong here, but I feel like most political scientists are more on the realist, pessimist side. Or am I reading that wrong?\n\nLucas: No, I think that’s probably right. I mean, all of the debates that we’re exploring in this paper, we selected because they are genuine debates in political science. So you can find examples—and I’m not talking about obscure arguments that nobody ever looks at—but serious, well-cited arguments on both sides of all of these debates.\n\nSo there’s certainly active debates in political science on all of these dimensions. But I think you’re right that, at the moment, you know, we haven’t done a survey of political scientists, so we’ve always talked about how we should, so that we can actually—\n\nDemsas: Oh, yeah. That’d be great.\n\nLucas: —tell people what proportion of political scientists hold these different theoretical positions. I think that my guess is that, as with everything, most people are kind of in the center. And so what you’re going to see if you talk to political scientists is varying degrees of acceptance of the core tenets of democratic realism or spatial voting or whatever.\n\nBut a lot of people will say, as I do, this slightly more hedging kind of argument that there are circumstances in which we would expect to see policy voting matter a lot. And there are a lot of circumstances where voters don’t have sufficient information on candidates, or the election issues aren’t especially salient, or whatever might be happening in that particular election, where people are just gonna fall back on social identities, partisan identities, ingrained rational or irrational retrospection about the past. So you’re going to see different examples of this depending on the election.\n\nSo part of the debate after Achen and Bartels’s book, Democracy for Realists, has been—I think much of the debate has been—not so much about, like, Let’s show that they’re completely wrong, but Let’s try to understand the conditions under which the kinds of phenomena they observe in that book happen, and how common are these things?\n\nAnd so, you know, Anthony Fowler, for example, has a paper where he uses some experimental designs to try to understand how often we would expect people to just vote with their party, regardless of the party’s policy commitments. And he finds it’s, like, maybe a little less than a third of the time. And that’s not nothing. I mean, that’s an enormous proportion.\n\nDemsas: Wait—how does he identify that? How does that paper go?\n\nLucas: It’s based on a conjoint experiment, and the conjoint experiment adds additional policy items. So you know the candidates’ parties. The way these conjoints work is you get two hypothetical candidates, and you’re asked, basically, which one you prefer.\n\nAnd so not only does the partisanship of the candidates vary, but the policy commitments of the candidates also varies, and the number of policy commitments varies. So what he shows is that as you add more policy information to the experiment, people are less likely to just vote straight party selection.\n\nAnd also, as you add more kind of counterintuitive policy commitments on the part of the candidate—like, you have a Republican who is, I don’t know, supportive of income-tax increases on the rich or something—that in those circumstances, you also see that people move away from those candidates. So they’re incorporating the policy information when they can, and about, I think, 29 or 30 percent in that study of the respondents just stick with the party candidate regardless of the policy commitments of the candidate.\n\nSo, you know, that’s a large number. The conclusion I draw from that is definitely not Okay, well, Achen and Bartels’s Democracy for Realists is wrong. But it’s also informative to try and understand, like, how often would it be the case that people would just vote for a partisan candidate, even if that partisan candidate doesn’t share some of their core policy commitments?\n\nAnd obviously, most of the time, these things are observationally equivalent. The Republican candidate is also more conservative on policy, and so it’s really hard to disentangle what is driving the choice of the voter to select that candidate. But there are these cases, both experimentally and also just some weird events that happen in the course of history, where you can try and disentangle that. And when you do, you see that there is some evidence to suggest that voters are able to incorporate their policy commitments into their voting.\n\nBut to come back around to your original question: Yes, I think if I were to preregister a hypothesis on this, my guess is that the democratic realists are the majority among political scientists who do voting behavior right now.\n\nDemsas: Turning to your paper, you’re interested in evaluating two things: one, how voters see themselves, and secondly, how politicians see voters. To this end, you designed a pretty massive survey. Can you walk me through what you and your co-authors did? What was the survey? Who did you talk to?\n\nLucas: Sure. So we wanted to understand on all of these debates that we’ve been talking about where politicians and members of the general public stand, rather than political scientists. So we have theories—political scientists have theories—about voters and voting behavior, and we spend much of our career arguing with each other about those theories. But especially when you watch politicians do their work, or you listen to what they say in speeches, or you even just pay attention to what they say in their memoirs about elections, they, too, seem to have theories of how voters behave and how elections work. And so we wanted to try and measure those among politicians and then also measure them among citizens to have some point of comparison for the politician’s theory.\n\nSo what we did was we wrote up eight questions that we hope capture eight of the more important theoretical debates in voting behavior, without kind of technical language or jargon or anything like that, and we just asked politicians and the members of the general public in 11 countries where they position themselves on each of those debates.\n\nSo we end up with data from just short of a thousand politicians, as well as data from about 12,000 citizens in the same country. So we can compare the citizens and the politicians within countries. And this is all part of a project that’s led by Stefaan Walgrave at the University of Antwerp called POLPOP, which stands for Politicians and Public Opinion.\n\nDemsas: And what kinds of politicians are we talking about here? I mean, I know these are very different systems. You’re looking at Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland. These are very different political systems. But are these, like, local? Are these federal? I mean, what kind of mix are you looking for?\n\nLucas: In this POLPOP project, it’s all national and regional politicians. So these are politicians who are in the central legislature in their country, as well as in some cases, some federal countries like Germany or Canada, where we have really important subnational systems, and we interview provincial or state politicians as well.\n\nSo these are kind of top-level politicians, if you think about the ladder of ambition in politics. We’ve done earlier studies with local politicians, but there are no local politicians in this study.\n\nDemsas: As you said, the questions are pretty straightforward. Like, for example, you just ask straight out, “Some say that voters are impatient and think about the short term when they vote. Others say that voters tend to focus on the long term. Where would you position yourself in this debate?” Zero to 10, with zero being short-term.\n\nIt’s very, very clear to the politician or the voter—you know, the general public that you’re surveying—what you are actually asking them to do. Why did you choose to have this kind of straightforward question versus, like, a question that could get at this answer, perhaps, by asking like, “Would you prefer a candidate whose policies you think would create long-term economic growth or one who would help address immediate cost-of-living concerns?” What was the benefit of the former?\n\nLucas: I think that you’re already onto the basic idea here, which is we just wanted it to be maximally clear. These are, in some cases, sort of complicated social-science debates, and we wanted to say, here, Look—there’s two poles in this particular debate. Here’s one pole; here’s the other. Where would you position yourself in that debate? So there are a number of ways to think about measuring this. And we’re thinking about ways to try and do some of those measures in the future. But because this was the first time that anyone had set out to measure these things among politicians in the kind of way that we do, we wanted to be able to make a clear case about what it was that we were measuring.\n\nAnd so asking sort of straightforward questions, having people position themselves in those debates seemed to us the best way to get started with this sort of work. And this, Some say X; others say Y. Where would you position yourself? is a really common structure for survey questions, and so that was something we thought would feel familiar to the people who are responding, which might also help with some understanding and clarity in the responses.\n\nDemsas: Cool. So let’s get to the findings. What do politicians think of voters, and what do voters think of themselves?\n\nLucas: So politicians, we say, are democratic realists. That is, they tend to subscribe to theories of voting behavior in which voters are not particularly well informed. They focus on short-term considerations. They focus on single issues rather than many issues. They blame politicians for things that are outside the politicians’ control. All of the sort of key ingredients of that book, Democracy for Realists, seem to be reflected in many politicians’ views.\n\nAnd we find that three-quarters of politicians across all of our countries fall into that theoretical type. And that contrasts very starkly with the members of the general public, who are much more evenly divided between the democratic realists and the other group, which we call “democratic optimists.” And these are a much more optimistic theory of a policy-oriented, well-informed, long-term-focused kinds of voters.\n\nDemsas: I thought this was really interesting. Most variation that you find is within country rather than cross-country, which is not something I expected. So essentially, it’s just in two of 22 cases that the country someone is from explains more than 10 percent of the variation in their position. To make that maybe even more clear: In the rest, 90 percent of the variation had nothing to do with whether you were Canadian or Portuguese or whatever. Does that surprise you?\n\nLucas: Yes, absolutely it does. I think it’s really remarkable that in countries as diverse as the ones we’re studying—some have proportional-representation systems, some have single-member plurality systems, some have compulsory voting, and some have mandatory—I mean, it’s just really diverse party systems and institutions. And we see really similar patterns among both the politicians and the comparison between the politicians and the general public across all of these countries. And yes, that was a surprise.\n\nDemsas: But there were two cases where it did explain more than 10 percent of the variation. What were those countries, and what happened there?\n\nLucas: The two areas where we do see meaningful cross-country variation are the question about whether voters focus on a party’s policy commitments or on the leader’s characteristics and competence—the characteristics of the party leader. And we see there is some cross-country variation on that one for sure. It does make sense because some electoral systems and party systems create more personalized politics than other systems. And so we do see that’s reflected in the results.\n\nAnd the other difference is on policy versus identity. This is really the question that’s kind of at the heart of a lot of debates about voting behavior these days—whether voters are oriented toward policy commitments that candidates and parties make, or if they vote based on deeply held social identities. And we see that a pretty substantial amount of the variance in responses on that question is explained by cross-country variation but, again, only among the politicians.\n\nSo it seems that there is something to be said for the experience of particular kinds of institutional structures or party systems in the development of the theories that you have about voters, especially on these two debates. But on the others, it’s much more consistent across countries.\n\nDemsas: One way to read your results, right—the fact that there’s such a difference between how voters view themselves and, you know, I guess many people would view it as, like, voters have a more rosy picture about themselves and what they’re doing than politicians do—is that voters are lying about themselves. And I think particularly in this moment, where there are a lot of people who are calling voters stupid for one reason or another, it can be tempting to just assume that voters are full of it, right? Like, that they’re just wanting to sound nicer than they are.\n\nBut there’s another study that pairs quite nicely with this that just came out recently in PNAS by a friend of the show, David Broockman and his frequent co-author Josh Kalla, about whether political practitioners have good instincts. So what they do is they basically measure the effects of a bunch of messages, real ones that politicians have either tweeted out or, like, the Heritage Foundation, for example, has put in documents, or other partisan outfits have put out about, you know, marijuana or guns or whatever. And then they ask political practitioners and lay people to predict which ones were effective. They find that political practitioners and lay people both performed barely better than chance at predicting persuasive effects. And you don’t really see much difference in those two groups.\n\nThis is obviously a different sort of study. They’re looking at different questions here. But there’s something here about our expectations that political professionals really understand the public better than the public understands itself. Like, maybe it’s the case that voters are more correct. So where do you fall in this? Like, I know you already said that you are more of a democratic optimist, but why would politicians be wrong about how voter publics are thinking about voting?\n\nLucas: Yeah, that’s a great question. One of the things I love about the work that David Broockman and his co-authors, Luke Hewitt and the others, have been doing on persuasion is that, in a way, it reveals how important politicians’ theories of the world really are. Because if it’s extremely difficult to know, for example, what kind of message is going to be persuasive in advance—in the absence of an experiment, kind of A/B testing persuasiveness, it’s really hard to know in advance—that opens a lot of room for people to rely on their intuitive working theories of the world to make decisions about what they’re going to do and how they’re going to behave, and in that case, what kind of advertisements to run, but also how to campaign or how to represent their constituents more generally.\n\nSo I think it’s just really difficult to learn about voting behavior from direct experience when you’re a politician. So there’s a lot of noise mixed in with the signal. It looks, based on our evidence, like politicians tend to be surrounded by democratic realists, and so it’s a little less likely that they’re going to update starkly on what seems like policy information. If you’re surrounded by people who have a different theory, you’re more likely to sort of retain that theory.\n\nAnd just in general, it’s very easy to interpret election results in a variety of ways. So you can imagine a scenario where a party runs an election campaign which is really focused on social identity, in-group appeals, anti-outgroup kind of sentiment, etcetera, and that party loses. And sure, a politician in that party could say, Well, I’m gonna update my theory a little bit and say, maybe, social identities aren’t as important as I thought. Or they might say, Well, we didn’t go far enough. We need to double down. We didn’t really fully commit. I mean, we hear this kind of thing in politics from campaign strategists and politicians and so forth sometimes.\n\nSo the feedback mechanism is really noisy, and the way that politicians learn about voting behavior is sometimes—you know, you’re getting conflicting signals sometimes, and it’s really hard to know. So I wouldn’t necessarily say that they’re always wrong, but you can imagine a mechanism where politicians, even though they have an incentive to know true information about how voter behavior really works, could hold theories that aren’t actually accurate.\n\nDemsas: So if voters were right about their own views of themselves, then wouldn’t that sort of imply that they were able to get good information about what elected officials are trying to do? We had this episode a few months ago on the show with Hunter Rendleman, who had a paper about the earned-income tax credit and looking at, in the United States, whether voters were actually responsive to governors expanding this social-welfare benefit in their state. And she is kind of an outlier in this field—well, I wouldn’t say outlier. She’s in the minority in the field of believing that voters, especially at the state level, are able to see and respond effectively to policies that may benefit them, that they say that they like.\n\nSo like, I guess my question to you is, like, why don’t we see more of these results in political science then? Why don’t we see voters responding positively to policies that they say that they want, that they like? Why don’t we see politicians recognizing this? Like, doesn’t this kind of push against a lot of our intuitions about how democracy is not really working right now?\n\nLucas: Yeah, I think it does. I will say, though, that we do have, even now, quite a bit of evidence that things like clear-eyed retrospection and policy commitments among parties still may matter. I mean, we have some evidence, for example, that more extreme candidates who run for office do worse than more moderate candidates coming from the same parties, and that suggests that voters are incorporating the information about the policy positions of these candidates into their choices.\n\nThe other thing to say is that I don’t think even the most fiercely committed spatial-voting theorists today would probably not want to claim that voters have the same level of importance or attach the same level of salience to every policy issue. And on a lot of issues, it does appear to be true that voters haven’t thought about it much. A party takes a position on that issue, and they just adopt the position of their preferred party.\n\nBut there can be an important difference between policy issues in general and the issues that you really do care about or think about a little more regularly. And we have some pretty good evidence that a lot of people—not all, but a lot of people—do have one or two issues that they care about with particular strength. And if their party abandoned their preferred position on those issues, there’s some reason to think that the voters would notice.\n\nSo I think you’re right that the citizens’ responses in the survey reflect a level of optimism that doesn’t seem to be manifested in the kinds of voting behavior that we’re seeing in elections right now. And so recent elections, I think, maybe lead you to think that there’s something persuasive about democratic realism. Let’s put it that way.\n\nDemsas: Well, I guess to steelman it, right, because the case that some people will make about Donald Trump, for instance, who I think is maybe the elephant in the room in every conversation right now, is that, you know, Donald Trump did attempt to moderate on key political promises. When he was running for office, he disavowed—well, he distanced himself, at least—he distanced himself from the most extreme parts of the pro-life movement. How reasonable you find that, given that he appointed members of the Supreme Court who were responsible for the end of Roe v. Wade, you know, your mileage might vary there.\n\nBut you know, he did distance himself verbally during the campaign. And there are reports that people believed he was interested in expanding IVF access and that people found that promise to be credible. On Medicaid and Social Security, he’s made multiple comments in public that he doesn’t want to touch. Of course, this was when he was running. Now that DOGE is happening, it’s unclear whether those promises will remain true.\n\nBut there is a story you could tell where Donald Trump really attempted on key issues to the electorate to appear more moderate. And there was—I mean, speaking of spatial voting—a survey where they looked at how the average voter saw themselves on sort of a left–right spectrum. And they saw themselves much closer to Donald Trump than to Kamala Harris. And to me, that indicates that, you know, regardless of whether people find some of his other policy positions and commitments to liberal democracy to be disqualifying, the voting public clearly saw many of his policy commitments as closer to where they were.\n\nLucas: Yes. Well, let me first say, as you well know, there’s quite an industry of research on the correlates of vote choice for Donald Trump these days, and I don’t have a particular comparative advantage on that as a person who mostly studies Canadian politics.\n\nBut a couple of pieces to put into the mix here that are absolutely happening: I mean, one, the point you made about policy voting, I think, is true. You see much more attention to cultural policy issues, in general, in recent elections and particular attention to immigration. And on those issues, there was some kind of policy alignment that Donald Trump was able to create, I think, that’s really important.\n\nBut the big thing I think I would point out is just this long-run trend toward personalization in politics. This is captured by our “party versus leaders” kind of theoretical debate in the paper—that people seem to be voting more and more on the basis of a particular leader’s character and competence in the eyes of voters, and that’s separate from their specific policy commitments. So even though we still see some evidence of spatial voting these days, it’s also true that when you look at many countries, including the United States, there’s very strong evidence of leader-based voting, where people are voting for somebody because they like that person, they like their character, or whatever.\n\nAnd they’re adopting the policy positions of that leader kind of after having decided that they really like them. So it’s, If this party leader has this view, then maybe I should have that view as well. And that’s not something that we would expect from spatial-voting theory, and it is something that seems to be happening in many countries, and so I think that’s definitely true.\n\nDemsas: After the break: the foreign national election that is somehow about Trump.\n\n[Break]\n\nDemsas: Well, let’s bring you to Canada, which remains a separate country from the United States. (Laughs.)\n\nIn Canada right now, the Conservative Party was slated to win quite handily. But things have changed, both after Trudeau resigned but notably after Trump was elected. And in particular, the kind of bump comes in January, when he is about to come into power and the threat of tariffs was becoming more real. How does that drastic shift towards the Liberals fit within these theories of voting behavior? I feel like there are a lot of stories you could tell.\n\nLucas: There are a lot of stories you could tell, and I suppose the story is still in the process of being written.\n\nBut one of the things that has happened in Canada since Pierre Poilievre became the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada is that we’ve had a radical shift in the kinds of issues that we’re talking about. And so whereas this time last year, we might have been talking about carbon taxes and the excesses of woke politics or whatever, now the focus is trade, economic health, economic survival, etcetera.\n\nAnd so we have an incoming leader of the Liberal Party who’s a former governor of two national banks, who is, I think most would agree, very competent on economic-policy issues. And that’s occurring at a moment when economic policy is just more salient than it has been in a long time. And there’s some really nice examples in the literature where researchers have seen that for parties, either an issue becomes extremely salient unexpectedly, or parties surprisingly change positions on an issue.\n\nAnd that gives you an opportunity to see what effect it has on voting. So a policy-voting theorist would expect in Canada that, because trade and the economy have become so salient, voters are going to—maybe a voter who would have otherwise supported the Conservatives, for example, but they trust Mark Carney’s Liberals to deal best with the trade issue—may shift their vote in the direction of the Liberals if it’s about that particular policy being important to them.\n\nDemsas: That raises, for me, a question about how stable you would expect findings about people’s self-assessments and politicians’ assessments of voter publics to be on these political theories. Like, do you think you’ve captured something lasting or just a snapshot of 2022 and 2023, when you were doing these surveys?\n\nLucas: There is evidence that politicians’ theories of voting behavior do evolve over time. There’s a study by John Kingdon many years ago, which compared candidates who had recently won an election and candidates who had recently lost an election. And as you may imagine, the candidates who lost were a little more cynical about voters’ capacities.\n\nSo certainly, politicians learn from experience. They become more or less optimistic, I think, based on how things seem to be going. But we have been asking these same questions of local politicians in Canada each year, going back a number of years now, and we see that there is some meaningful stability to the responses they give.\n\nSo we find that there’s some correlation year over year in their responses, in the way that you would expect if their responses are tapping into some meaningful position on the debate. So they’re certainly not perfectly correlated; there’s plenty of measurement error in these questions. But there’s a relationship over time that suggests that politicians have somewhat stable views on this.\n\nNow, among the general public, our working theory of what citizens are doing when they answer these questions is essentially accessing top-of-mind cultural narratives about how democracy works. We don’t want to make the claim that when members of the general public encounter these questions, they think, Well, I’m glad you asked, because I’ve been spending the last eight months thinking about prospective versus retrospective voting, and here’s my position.\n\nIt’s more like, What is the most common top-of-mind, culturally available or culturally acceptable narrative about how democracy works? I think that’s a reasonable inference about what those general-public responses reflect. And so the important thing for our purposes is to say, If it’s true that this is your kind of default, culturally accessible story about voters and voting behavior and elections, then it’s remarkable that politicians have developed a very different kind of theory that doesn’t reflect those highly accessible kinds of cultural narratives.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. I wonder, too, about which way the causal arrow goes, right? Like, is it that working in politics makes politicians more likely to have these democratic-realist views of voters? Or that there’s a selection effect going on whereby democratic realists are more likely to become politicians? Does your study give us any insight into that?\n\nLucas: Yeah, I love this question. I’m sort of obsessed by it, actually. How politicians come to develop these theories, I think, is super interesting. So we have some clues about this, but really nothing more than clues in the paper as it stands.\n\nOne thing we can say is that more senior politicians are a little more likely to be democratic realists than more junior politicians. So it’s not a huge difference. It’s, like, 60 percent versus 68 percent when you compare the junior to the senior. But there’s a difference there, which suggests that politicians learn; they become more democratic realist in their theories over time as they move through their political careers. So they’re not arriving on the scene kind of fully formed, hardcore democratic realists, it looks like from the data.\n\nThe other sort of clue that we have is that we can compare members of the general public whose demographic characteristics most closely resemble politicians—because, of course, politicians are not a random draw from the public. They tend to be older, better educated, more wealthy, and so forth. So we can look at citizens who match those characteristics of politicians and compare them to the politicians. And we still see there’s an enormous gap between citizens who are kind of like politicians in their demographics and politicians.\n\nAnd so that suggests there is something like the selection effect you describe going on, where people who have these kinds of views about politics—maybe because they’ve become involved in politics, and they’ve learned these theories from others, more senior people who are involved in politics, early in their career, before they even jump into politics themselves as a candidate—but something is going on to select people who are disproportionately likely to be democratic realists in the first place. And then it seems like the political experience is reinforcing those views over time.\n\nDemsas: So I guess another story I could tell is that the reason why older, more experienced politicians are morally democratic realists is: Maybe cynical people kind of stick it out longer in politics.\n\nLucas: Could be.\n\nDemsas: And I guess the reason why I am pondering that story is because if you abstract away from politics, if you’re just talking generally about someone with expertise in a field or in a job, you’d expect that over time, that you get better at doing the job, right? Even if you’re just, like, learning from your environment. You’re, like, picking things up generally. But also just in politics, it’s not exactly like the private sector, but there is, like, a win-loss condition that’s extremely impactful, both to your financial interests but also your identity, like desires in life and your self-conception as a successful person. And so you’d expect people to get better over time the longer they stay in there, or at least better at winning elections, which I would think requires understanding how to get voters to vote for you. So I don’t know how plausible you find that story.\n\nLucas: It’s true that there’s a certain species of very senior politician that has become quite grizzled and cynical about voting and voting behavior. We heard from them because we did these interviews face-to-face with the politicians. So as they work through the survey, because they’re politicians and they generally like to talk, they would sometimes provide a little color commentary as they’re working through the questions. And I certainly remember some very senior politicians in Canada saying, Well, you know, I’m sorry to say it, but voters are not that knowledgeable. You know, that kind of “grizzled old veteran” view of politics.\n\nBut yeah, I mean, I think that you would expect there to be some kind of learning mechanism. The tricky thing is, and the thing that we have to ponder here is how involved politicians are in different countries in making decisions about the campaigns they run and the consequences of those campaigns.\n\nSo we think it really matters what politicians’ theories of voting and elections are for the choices they make about how they behave as representatives and how they communicate with constituents and maybe how they campaign. But how they campaign is quite variable. Depending on if you’re looking at, like, a closed-list PR system in Portugal or a single-member plurality system in Canada, you have kind of varying levels of control over how you present yourself to voters.\n\nSo I think you would expect that the machinery of campaigns would improve over time. But that may not be reflected very directly in the theories that individual politicians hold about voters and voting behavior. And the other twist on this, going back to the paper you mentioned and more generally the research agenda that David Broockman and his co-authors are doing on persuasion: Using the swayable experiment data, they show that the factors that predict whether an advertisement in their case is persuasive are quite context dependent. They change over time. So what predicts persuasiveness in one election looks different in the next election. And so it may be harder to learn. There may be less of a sort of evolutionary convergence toward the optimal election strategy than you expect, because each election has dynamics that are so different from the previous one.\n\nDemsas: So one of the axes I definitely want to ask you about is on sociotropic versus egocentric voting, because I think that’s been a big point of debate in the American context. To define things, sociotropic means, like, kind of voting in the national interest, versus egocentric, in self-interest, sometimes referred to, I think, as pocketbook voting.\n\nSo my friend and colleague Derek Thompson had this fun piece titled “‘Everything Is Terrible, but I’m Fine.’” We’ll link it in the show notes. And he points to a couple of indicators where people say that their own personal situation, you know, they’re doing pretty well. Like, on finances, they look at consumer sentiment. But if you ask about the nation as a whole, they think we’re, like, being fed to the dogs. You know what I mean? And it’s, like, this massive divergence between people’s self-assessments and even their local-community assessments and the national context.\n\nYou know, we’ve seen this, also, in crime, as well, when you ask people about how much crime is happening, but also about public schools. Like, people usually like their public schools, but they’ll say, like, Public schooling in the country is just absolutely trash. So lots of poli-sci literature shows that voters are sociotropic in their voting, which feels pretty weird to me. I would assume people would be self-interested.\n\nAnd there was a 2017 study in ASPR by Andrew Healy, Mikael Persson, and Erik Snowberg, which showed that voters do focus on their own pocketbook as well as national assessments of how the country is going, which is a more moderate view. I guess, like most things, people are doing both of these all the time. But what do you find in your survey? How are people thinking about these questions?\n\nLucas: Politicians overwhelmingly think that voters are egocentric. And citizens are a little more divided, but they tend to think that voters are more sociotropic. And if there’s any one of these debates where one could I most strongly claim that the politicians have it wrong, this is probably the one that you’d pick. I mean, this is actually one where we got a little bit of pushback when we were presenting the paper to some colleagues, and they said, Well, you call these debates, but we all know that it’s sociotropic. So it’s not really a debate, is it? But as you say, there’s the “Digging Into the Pocketbook” paper by Healy et al. And it uses really high-quality Swedish registry data, where you know survey respondents’ actual tax records and their personal financial situation, and it suggests that the pocketbook voting does happen.\n\nThere’s some other evidence like this, but I do think that the consensus for a long time—and it was unexpected at first but has grown over time to be, I think, accepted as consensus—is that sociotropic voting is most of what people are doing when they engage in retrospective thinking about: How well are things going? And on that basis, will I reward or punish the incumbent? So on this one, I think you could make a pretty good case that the politicians’ general consensus is not the same as the political scientists’ general consensus.\n\nDemsas: I mean this “sociotropic versus pocketbook” really fits into what happened with the Biden administration. I mean, I hear from Biden officials all the time that they’re like, Well, if you look at people’s personal financial situation, they were doing much better when you look at real wages, or all these, like, debates. But then, of course, you know, a lot about the American economy was great in the last couple years in terms of growth, but inflation as a macro story was really high.\n\nAnd it’s funny—even as people have understood that inflation was a big part of this election, they still talk about it in terms of their pocketbooks, right? They’re still like, Oh, the reason why inflation was so harmful to the Biden administration’s reelection efforts and, of course, Harris’s election effort was because people had to pay too much for eggs or for milk or for whatever. But it seems like: No. People actually really do care about the national vibe of these things. And I mean, to me, that’s actually a very optimistic view of my fellow countrymen, that, like, Even if I’m doing okay—you know, my wages are pretty good; I got a house in 2021 with a 2 percent mortgage rate—like, I still care that inflation’s doing really badly across the whole country.\n\nLucas: Yeah. Well, I’m all for your optimistic take on your fellow countrymen. I mean, why not? But I suppose the democratic-realist response, the sort of slight devil’s advocate response here would be that the sociotropic retrospection depends much more clearly on a perception of how well things are going that may be quite a bit less clearly linked to reality. So you kind of know what your income is and how it’s changing and probably know how much your groceries are costing week by week, but to have a clear perception of how well the economy has done over the last four years on a number of indicators is more challenging, and so more susceptible to elite framing and so forth. So I suppose the-glass-half-empty story would be: It’s just much more malleable.\n\nDemsas: I was looking at the response rate from your data collection from the politicians, and it’s highly variable. I was really surprised. I don’t know if you read anything into it. In Canada, where you are: 12 percent response rate, and that’s the lowest of any country you guys reach out to in this study. And in Belgium, the response rate is 85 percent. Does that mean anything to you about the politicians you have or the system? (Laughs.)\n\nLucas: What it means to me is that my colleagues on this project love to tease me about our low response rate in Canada. So thank you for bringing that up. This is sort of an enduring mystery of elite research that nobody really quite understands.\n\nSo there’s two pieces to this. One is that the Belgian team are a bunch of wizards when it comes to attracting and recruiting politicians to participate in their studies. They’re just tireless and really amazing at what they do, and so part of their high response rate is definitely down to their hard work and the credibility that they’ve built over the years with the politicians in that country.\n\nBut we also see systematic differences in response rates across countries. When you do surveys of politicians, the response rates in North America are just lower, no matter how much you beg, what strategies you employ. They’re just a lot lower, and nobody seems to know—I mean, even within Europe, there’s a lot of variation—nobody seems to know exactly why. It’s not entirely a function of how many requests they receive. Because we see some very large countries, where the politicians are getting a lot of requests, have low response rates, and some big countries have high response rates. It’s a bit of a mystery, to be honest with you.\n\nBut yes, the response rates are quite variable across countries. And even though we have a large number of politicians in total, it is certainly true that more of those politicians come from some countries than from others.\n\nDemsas: Do you worry about selection effects in countries with low response rates? Like, you’re getting responses from people who are especially motivated to engage in this research versus one where you’re getting kind of broad representation?\n\nLucas: Yeah, absolutely. This is something that we worry about, and it’s especially the case because this isn’t a random sample of politicians. I mean, I suppose there’s really no random samples out there anymore. But this is certainly an opt-in study. We invite them to participate. We send invitations to all of the politicians, and those who choose to participate, they do. And the other ones don’t. So yes, we have to think about this a lot.\n\nAnd so one of the things you can do is just collect as much background information on all of the politicians in the country that you can, and then you can compare the people who participate in the survey to the full population of politicians to get some sense of how different they are. And what we find is that on most of the observables that we collect, the politicians who participate in our study look a lot like the broader population of politicians. So that’s true on age, gender, on the party they come from, the ideological flavor of the party they come from. On many of those things, we don’t see any particular reason to worry.\n\nThe one thing I would flag as a difference between our sample and the population is that the participants in our study do tend to be a little bit more junior in their careers. So the amount of time they’ve had in office is a little less, and it’s not surprising that’s the case, because if you’re a cabinet minister or a prime minister or a party leader or something who’s been around a long time, you probably have less time to spend with us answering questions about politics. So—\n\nDemsas: But that could actually cut both ways, interestingly. Because one way you could read that is like, Oh, are you missing out on people with the most information about voters? But junior people are the ones who just had to win potentially more difficult elections, because they don’t have, you know, the incumbency advantage or the party connections in parliamentary systems. And so, you know, they maybe are actually more closely aligned with what voters are looking for right then.\n\nLucas: Yeah, that’s exactly the logic I think you have to use to think this through, is if you do have a slight underrepresentation from some group, like, what evidence is there that the people in that group would be different in their responses to the people, when compared to the people who did respond? So we can look at the smaller number of very senior politicians who are participants in our study, and we can say, Is there any evidence that our findings are really particularly influenced by a slight underrepresentation among those folks? And that’s a way that you can kind of test this out.\n\nAnd we find that the people who don’t participate in these surveys, partly because of how many politicians do participate, they would have to be so dramatically, kind of implausibly different in their views from the people who do participate to change the results. That gives us some confidence. But yes, you’re right. I mean, it could be an advantage. Sometimes you want overrepresentation from certain kinds of participants in order to get their views a little more clearly.\n\nDemsas: So can I ask why you guys don’t have America in your sample? Just because it’s an American show.\n\nLucas: Yeah. This is a good question. It’s a little bit above my pay grade, but I think that if I can speculate a little or put words in Stefaan Walgrave’s mouth a little bit: I mentioned how response rates in Canada are quite low relative to Belgium or Switzerland and so forth. The response rates in studies of national politicians, especially, in the United States are even lower.\n\nDemsas: Brutal.\n\nLucas: So the prospect of getting members of Congress to sit down with us for 30 or 40, 45 minutes and participate in this study, I think, are really low. Now, we could still explore maybe state-level politicians or state-level politicians in very big states. There are alternatives here, but for the moment, I mean, this project started in Europe, and it seems to be continuing to expand. So it may be that down the road, the United States is included in future rounds.\n\nI will tell you, though, that we have collected data on these questions in the United States, separately from the POLPOP project. There are local-politician responses. It’s not the national politicians, but we still do have some information about where American politicians stand on these questions. So if you’re curious about the American politicians, I can tell you a little something about them. Although, they’re not exactly equivalent to the others in this study.\n\nSo we have data from about, I think, 580 American local politicians. These are mayors and councilors from municipalities above about 1,000 population. And what we found is that two-thirds of the American local politicians are democratic realists. So what that tells me is two things: First, the majority of American local politicians are democratic realists, just like every other country that we study, and second, in Canada, we can compare local politicians to federal and provincial politicians. And we find the local politicians tend to be a little bit less likely to be democratic realists. And so if we extrapolate that logic to the United States, my guess is that you’re probably seeing proportions that are similar to Canada, like 80–85 percent of national politicians espousing these democratic-realist positions. That’s a guess, but it’s an educated guess based on the data that we have from American local politicians.\n\nWe also see some differences across party. For the most part, two things: The American local politicians are more democratic realist in character than the Canadian local politicians, and second, there’s not that much difference between the two parties. So only on the question of identity versus policy do we see meaningful, statistically distinguishable differences between the parties, where the Democrats are more identity-oriented theorists, and the Republicans are more policy oriented. So Democrats are a little more likely to think that voters are identity oriented, that they kind of make their voting decisions based on deeply held social identities, when compared to Republicans. So that’s an interesting—\n\nDemsas: When did you do this survey? What year?\n\nLucas: It was 2022 when we did this survey of American local politicians.\n\nDemsas: So I guess that would indicate that Democratic politicians—well, like, if we assume that voters are correct about why they vote and voters in the United States are similar to the voters you’re seeing in your sample of other Western democracies in your newer paper, that would indicate to me that Democrats are worse than Republicans at assessing voters’ behavior. Is that what you’re getting?\n\nLucas: It could be. It could be that Democratic voters really are more oriented to social identity. I mean, there’s this long-standing argument that the Democratic Party is more of a coalition of groups, and the Republican Party has been, at least historically, focused on particular kinds of policy commitments. I don’t feel like I’m in a position to adjudicate the persuasiveness of that argument. But it is out there that maybe the factors that predict voting are a little bit different among Democratic voters than Republican voters. So that’s possible.\n\nAnd it’s also possible that just by virtue of being socialized into a particular political party, you learn slightly different theories from your mentors and campaign strategists and campaign managers and so on, and that there’s just, like, a slightly different subculture in those two different parties.\n\nDemsas: Always our last question is: What is something that you once thought was a good idea but ended up being only good on paper?\n\nLucas: Well, I’m embarrassed to admit, I have always had a bit of a weakness for the life-hacks genre of online writing, which means I’ve tried many, many things that turned out to be a bad idea. But let me give you a non-life-hack example.\n\nSo when I started my job at the university, I was so excited to have gotten an academic position, and I felt like I really wanted to give this new role the respect that it deserved. So I came up with this romantic idea that I was gonna write all of my lectures word for word, and there are gonna be these beautiful lectures that had allusions to poetry and history and so forth.\n\nAnd I can tell you that the look on my students’ faces when I showed up in a classroom in 2015, and they realized I was gonna be lecturing at them like it was a sort of Oxford College in 1875, they were not thrilled. So I quickly realized I needed to adopt a teaching style that was somewhat more appropriate for the century I was living in.\n\nDemsas: Well, thank you so much, Jack. This was a fantastic conversation.\n\nLucas: Thanks so much for having me. It’s a real thrill to be part of the podcast.\n\nDemsas: Good on Paper is produced by Rosie Hughes.

        "title": "The Retired J.P. Morgan Executive Tracking Trump’s Deportation Flights",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration’s plan to dust off the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was in the works long before March 15. But the precise timing was hazy. Immigration attorneys went to federal court that morning to try to block the government from using the extraordinary wartime authority, which allows deportations without due process. There were few signs that the White House was about to use the law to send planeloads of Venezuelans to a prison complex in El Salvador.\n\nThe first person to alert the public that the flights would actually take place was not an official or a lawyer or a journalist, but a retired J.P. Morgan executive living in Ohio named Tom Cartwright. “TWO HIGHLY UNUSUAL ICE flights showing up now from Harlingen to El Salvador,” he wrote on social media, noting that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken that route, flying out of a city in southern Texas, only once during the past month and a half. “Venezuelan deportation??”\n\nImmigration attorneys raced back to court. And the events of the next several hours took the country closer to a constitutional crisis than any other clash to date between Donald Trump and the judicial branch, as Trump officials brushed off D.C. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg’s order to halt the flights.\n\nCartwright’s role in the episode isn’t well known. But over the past two months, as immigrant-rights groups, congressional aides, and reporters have struggled to keep tabs on the Trump administration’s deportation push, they have relied more and more on Cartwright, a 71-year-old immigrant-rights activist who, in retirement, has become an eagle-eyed tracker of U.S. deportation flights, which the government rarely publicizes.\n\nEvery day, he compiles data on ICE flights, applying skills developed over a career managing banks with hundreds of billions of dollars in assets. Using publicly available information from aviation tracking sites, he produces weekly and monthly reports detailing where ICE Air—the government’s deportation airline—is directing its planes.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: Trump is deporting ‘them’ in ways that threaten us\n\nOver the past several weeks, Cartwright has become the go-to source for many people looking for details on the Trump administration’s deportation flights to Guantánamo Bay, its use of military transport planes, and the controversial flights to El Salvador. Think tanks and legal organizations cite his work. This past weekend, when The New York Times published a visual report describing how the frequency of U.S. deportation flights has not significantly increased since Trump took office, despite the president’s promises, the article cited “a New York Times review of an independent database.” The database is Cartwright’s. His work was the basis for a similar CNN story earlier this month.\n\nCartwright began tracking ICE flights during Trump’s first term and continued sending out monthly reports to journalists, nonprofit groups, and congressional staff through the Biden administration. But Trump’s pledge to deport “millions” in his second term—and his mobilization of federal resources and aggressive use of executive authorities—has recently put Cartwright’s data in higher demand.\n\n“He took information that was publicly available but labor-intensive to compile, and did something nobody else was doing,” Adam Isacson, a border-security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a rights organization in D.C., told me. “I don’t know if he expected this second career to make him basically the world’s only credible public source on U.S. deportation flights, just as they were becoming part of one of the United States’ biggest national news stories.”\n\n“He’s indispensable,” added Robyn Barnard, an advocate for refugees with the group Human Rights First, who told me she was stunned when she first learned of Cartwright’s background in banking rather than activism.\n\nSoft-spoken and bookish, with a graying beard, glasses, and a gentlemanly manner, Cartwright takes a more modest view of his role in the nation’s immigration furor. “I think that these people deserve the dignity of at least someone paying attention to what’s happening to them,” he told me, referring to the deportees on ICE Air. “It’s a dehumanizing process.”\n\nICE Air doesn’t operate like an ordinary commercial carrier. It uses private charter aircraft whose crew include security contractors and ICE officers. The flights typically carry about 125 deportees placed in shackles and leg chains. ICE says that these security measures are necessary to ensure that the badly outnumbered crewmembers can maintain order and prevent deportees from attempting to seize the cabin or rioting (both of which sometimes happen).\n\nThe U.S. immigration enforcement system is notoriously opaque; unlike in the criminal-justice system, ICE does not typically release the names of the people it arrests. ICE periodically discloses its flight activity in press releases, though it does so selectively and at its own pace. Still, the charter aircraft that ICE uses have tail numbers that show up on aviation tracking apps and sites, such as Flight Aware, Flightradar24, and ADS-B Exchange, where Cartwright can get a real-time view of the planes in the air.\n\nQuinta Jurecic: The ultimate Trump story\n\nThe work became more difficult when Trump officials started putting deportees on military-transport planes, whose tail numbers and itineraries don’t appear on the tracking sites. Cartwright has managed to find military flights by using the apps to search more than a dozen airports where U.S. military flights originate, looking for aircraft with no tail numbers. Then he cross-references that information with other public sources, such as news reports in destination countries.\n\nCartwright said that he spent about 20 hours a week tracking ICE flights before Trump took office this year. That’s up to 30 or 40 hours now. “It’s literally an everyday job,” he told me, wearily. “There’s no backup.”\n\nCartwright grew up in Springfield, Illinois, and settled in Columbus, Ohio, as he moved up the ranks at J.P. Morgan to become the chief financial officer for one of the company’s largest divisions, covering 5,000 bank branches. He sees the immigration-advocacy work he embraced in retirement as a continuation of the ethos he practiced during his career. “I always felt in the financial world we were helping people,” he told me. “I know that’s a really bizarre thing to say for someone who's a liberal activist, but that’s really how I got into the career in a small bank in Springfield.”\n\nCartwright did volunteer work during the migrant crisis in Greece in 2015, when the bodies of drowned migrants were washing ashore, including a toddler whose photograph pushed European countries to accept more refugees. During the first Trump administration, when the president escalated ICE efforts against Central American families and minors who arrived without parents, Cartwright, a practicing Catholic, began volunteering at shelters run by Catholic aid groups in South Texas. He joined the activist group Witness at the Border, which monitors ICE operations to “bear witness” to practices it considers abusive.\n\nCartwright told me he was inspired by a fellow volunteer he met in Texas, a woman in her 80s, who was watching deportees being loaded onto an ICE flight, counting each person out loud. He asked her if she was trying to figure out how many people were getting on the plane. “She said, ‘No,’” Cartwright told me. “‘I don’t know their names, but I want to make sure I see every individual.’”\n\nActivist groups were struggling at the time to figure out where ICE was sending deportees. Cartwright had never used aviation tracking apps, but he had data-management and analytical skills that other activists lacked. Tracking ICE flights allowed him to ward off the despairing feeling that no one was watching and no one cared, he told me.\n\nCartwright’s database shows that ICE has carried out 267 deportation flights under Trump, and that the president is using military-transport planes—whose operating costs are three to five times as high as conventional passenger aircrafts’—at an unprecedented rate.\n\nRead: ICE isn’t delivering the mass deportation Trump wants\n\nOtherwise Cartwright’s data show that the pattern and frequency of ICE flights haven’t significantly changed under Trump 2.0—something that might come as a surprise given the controversies and court battles triggered by the administration’s aggressive attempt to ramp up immigration arrests and deportations. ICE officers—backed by other federal law-enforcement agencies that Trump has mobilized—have made about three times as many immigration arrests as they did during President Joe Biden’s final months in office. But a sharp drop in illegal crossings at the Mexico border has left ICE with fewer easy-to-deport migrants. ICE officers are trying to meet Trump’s deportation goals by going after more immigration-law violators in U.S. cities and communities than during Biden’s term.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has not told Cartwright to stop publishing the information he compiles, he said. In fact, he sometimes sends his reports to ICE, though he’s never received a response. The agency did not respond to a request for comment about Cartwright’s data gathering.\n\nCartwright takes accuracy in his reports seriously, he told me. “I spent 38 years in the financial world, and often my things would end up in SEC filings,” he said. “I don’t bend facts. It’s not in my nature.”\n\nBut after logging nearly 35,000 ICE flights, Cartwright told me that he’s worn out. He’s ready for his retirement to become a real one. He wants the work to continue, though, and has found some willing understudies among a group of activists in Seattle whom he’s started to train. He’ll share his methods with anyone, he said, then added: “There are some things you know that just aren’t teachable. You have to learn them as you go.”\n\nWhat’s important to him, he said, is to make sure someone will keep watching.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The administration has downplayed the importance of the text messages inadvertently sent to The Atlantic’s editor in chief.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSo, about that Signal chat.\n\nOn Monday, shortly after we published a story about a massive Trump-administration security breach, a reporter asked the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, why he had shared plans about a forthcoming attack on Yemen on the Signal messaging app. He answered, “Nobody was texting war plans. And that’s all I have to say about that.”\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nAt a Senate hearing yesterday, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Ratcliffe, were both asked about the Signal chat, to which Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, was inadvertently invited by National Security Adviser Michael Waltz. “There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal group,” Gabbard told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nRatcliffe said much the same: “My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump, asked yesterday afternoon about the same matter, said, “It wasn’t classified information.”\n\nThese statements presented us with a dilemma. In The Atlantic’s initial story about the Signal chat—the “Houthi PC small group,” as it was named by Waltz—we withheld specific information related to weapons and to the timing of attacks that we found in certain texts. As a general rule, we do not publish information about military operations if that information could possibly jeopardize the lives of U.S. personnel. That is why we chose to characterize the nature of the information being shared, not specific details about the attacks.\n\nRead: The Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans\n\nThe statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump—combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts—have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions. There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared.\n\nExperts have repeatedly told us that use of a Signal chat for such sensitive discussions poses a threat to national security. As a case in point, Goldberg received information on the attacks two hours before the scheduled start of the bombing of Houthi positions. If this information—particularly the exact times American aircraft were taking off for Yemen—had fallen into the wrong hands in that crucial two-hour period, American pilots and other American personnel could have been exposed to even greater danger than they ordinarily would face. The Trump administration is arguing that the military information contained in these texts was not classified—as it typically would be—although the president has not explained how he reached this conclusion.\n\nYesterday, we asked officials across the Trump administration if they objected to us publishing the full texts. In emails to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, and the White House, we wrote, in part: “In light of statements today from multiple administration officials, including before the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the information in the Signal chain about the Houthi strike is not classified, and that it does not contain ‘war plans,’ The Atlantic is considering publishing the entirety of the Signal chain.”\n\nWe sent our first request for comment and feedback to national-security officials shortly after noon, and followed up in the evening after most failed to answer.\n\nLate yesterday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emailed a response: “As we have repeatedly stated, there was no classified information transmitted in the group chat. However, as the CIA Director and National Security Advisor have both expressed today, that does not mean we encourage the release of the conversation. This was intended to be a an [sic] internal and private deliberation amongst high-level senior staff and sensitive information was discussed. So for those reason [sic] — yes, we object to the release.” (The Leavitt statement did not address which elements of the texts the White House considered sensitive, or how, more than a week after the initial air strikes, their publication could have bearing on national security.)\n\nA CIA spokesperson asked us to withhold the name of John Ratcliffe’s chief of staff, which Ratcliffe had shared in the Signal chain, because CIA intelligence officers are traditionally not publicly identified. Ratcliffe had testified earlier yesterday that the officer is not undercover and said it was “completely appropriate” to share their name in the Signal conversation. We will continue to withhold the name of the officer. Otherwise, the messages are unredacted.\n\nListen: Jeffrey Goldberg on the group chat that broke the internet\n\nAs we wrote on Monday, much of the conversation in the “Houthi PC small group” concerned the timing and rationale of attacks on the Houthis, and contained remarks by Trump-administration officials about the alleged shortcomings of America’s European allies. But on the day of the attack—Saturday, March 15—the discussion veered toward the operational.\n\nAt 11:44 a.m. eastern time, Hegseth posted in the chat, in all caps, “TEAM UPDATE:”\n\nThe text beneath this began, “TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.” Centcom, or Central Command, is the military’s combatant command for the Middle East. The Hegseth text continues:\n\n“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)”\n\n“1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)”\n\nLet us pause here for a moment to underscore a point. This Signal message shows that the U.S. secretary of defense texted a group that included a phone number unknown to him—Goldberg’s cellphone—at 11:44 a.m. This was 31 minutes before the first U.S. warplanes launched, and two hours and one minute before the beginning of a period in which a primary target, the Houthi “Target Terrorist,” was expected to be killed by these American aircraft. If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests—or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media—the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds. The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.\n\nThe Hegseth text then continued:\n\n“1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)”\n\n“1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)”\n\n“1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”\n\n“MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”\n\n“We are currently clean on OPSEC”—that is, operational security.\n\n“Godspeed to our Warriors.”\n\nShortly after, Vice President J. D. Vance texted the group, “I will say a prayer for victory.”\n\nAt 1:48 p.m., Waltz sent the following text, containing real-time intelligence about conditions at an attack site, apparently in Sanaa: “VP. Building collapsed. Had multiple positive ID. Pete, Kurilla, the IC, amazing job.” Waltz was referring here to Hegseth; General Michael E. Kurilla, the commander of Central Command; and the intelligence community, or IC. The reference to “multiple positive ID” suggests that U.S. intelligence had ascertained the identities of the Houthi target, or targets, using either human or technical assets.\n\nSix minutes later, the vice president, apparently confused by Waltz’s message, wrote, “What?”\n\nAt 2 p.m., Waltz responded: “Typing too fast. The first target – their top missile guy – we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed.”\n\nVance responded a minute later: “Excellent.” Thirty-five minutes after that, Ratcliffe, the CIA director, wrote, “A good start,” which Waltz followed with a text containing a fist emoji, an American-flag emoji, and a fire emoji. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.\n\nLater that afternoon, Hegseth posted: “CENTCOM was/is on point.” Notably, he then told the group that attacks would be continuing. “Great job all. More strikes ongoing for hours tonight, and will provide full initial report tomorrow. But on time, on target, and good readouts so far.”\n\nIt is still unclear why a journalist was added to the text exchange. Waltz, who invited Goldberg into the Signal chat, said yesterday that he was investigating “how the heck he got into this room.”",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Poetry in the 21st century is both ubiquitous and oddly peripheral. Verses are displayed on subway walls, recited on momentous occasions, and served up in giant fonts on social media, but rarely do they merit a book review or a position on end-of-year reading lists. Yet the medium evolves even when it isn’t the center of attention, and over the past 25 years, its authors have pursued astonishing new forms and reinvented old ones. The Atlantic has prized and published poetry since its founding in 1857. And so, a quarter of the way into this new century of cataclysmic change, we thought it was an apt time to consider how poets fit into the broader conversation—to document an emerging canon of the most significant verse of the century so far.\n\nNo list can be comprehensive or infallible, but we did not approach this one lightly. After considering various criteria, we landed on work that felt consequential. We were looking for poetry that had struck its readers, for whatever reasons, as unforgettable, enduring, and influential: maybe because it came as an unexpected gift from a friend or loved one, or in the form of a classroom discovery; maybe because it reframed the world in such a way that culture or society felt foundationally shaken. Maybe it was just because, to paraphrase Emily Dickinson, it takes the top of your head off.\n\n↓ Jump to the list here\n\nTo establish a consensus, we consulted with more than 450 people—poets and fiction writers, but also publishers, editors, and informed readers from a variety of fields—asking them to name 10 books apiece. Together, they cast nearly 1,000 votes and recommended more than 400 collections of verse. Finally, we limited the list to Americans: Asking 25 books to represent 25 years of artistic progress within the many traditions that feed into American poetry was difficult enough.\n\nFor all the variety that emerged in this process, the collections below have a striking amount in common. These poems share a sense of urgency that reflects the overwhelmingly stressful events swirling around them—matters of war, race, gender, politics, health, immigration, climate change, rule, and misrule. Many of them mix genres and media in ways that were rare before 2000. Building on 20th-century innovations within confessional and prose poetry, they have melded lyric verse with memoir and essay, poetry with prose, official documents with photographs, video stills, and paintings. These poets have not walled themselves off from a world that has grown more fragmented, hybridized, and image driven. They have let it in, and allowed it to enrich their work and open up new pathways for younger writers.\n\nIn the previous century, the poet Derek Walcott invoked the image of a broken vase that is reassembled with a love “stronger than that love which took its symmetry for granted when it was whole.” His metaphor certainly encompasses this new canon, but it also describes an ongoing tradition. Poetry has always assembled and disassembled—and reassembled—in all kinds of magical and necessary ways. — Daniel Halpern and Walt Hunter\n\n25\n\nTo 2040\n\nBy Jorie Graham\n\n“Are we / extinct yet. Who owns / the map. May I / look”: Blending question and proposition, the opening lines of Graham’s To 2040 stake out the ambitious scope and elegiac spirit of the poet’s foray into a near future. Her 15th collection reflects on a natural world under siege, fading human memories of a once-bounteous Earth, and the poet’s own failing body. As in Graham’s earlier work, the changing terrain—both planetary and personal—demands fierce attention. Her signature long lines track the speaker’s mind as it registers difficulty and darkness: that “the quiet / before the storm is / the storm,” that “the claw full of hair” on a shower ledge is “such a surprise.” Lyric moments arrive in short lines and brief stanzas: “The fish the / water the sand the / needle in the pine. The here. Hear it / breathing.” Don’t expect a map. Instead, the poet summons readers to “look behind you, turn, look down as much as you can, notice all / that disappears.”\n\nTo 2040 By Jorie Graham\n\n24\n\nDon’t Call Us Dead\n\nBy Danez Smith\n\nHow fragile is the wall between life and death? Smith’s writing asks the question again and again. “every day is a funeral & a miracle,” one of the works in this collection announces with the confidence of a proverb. For the Black, queer speaker, the possibility of death is a constant companion: “hallelujah! today i rode / past five police cars / & i can tell you about it.” In that poem’s first stanza, Smith introduces an unsettling image: “on the bad nights, i wake to my mother / shoveling dirt down my throat / i scream mom! i’m alive! i’m alive! / but it just sounds like dirt.” This is not the account of a natural demise, but Smith relays the harrowing sense that its untimely arrival was inevitable. Life is not just a miracle in the biblical sense, then, but a commodity often denied to the people once sold as cargo themselves. With a clear reverence for both the living and those who have passed on, Don’t Call Us Dead weaves together history, intensely personal revelations, and Smith’s audacious visions of a safer future for us all.\n\nDon’t Call Us Dead By Danez Smith\n\n23\n\nThe Shadow of Sirius\n\nBy W. S. Merwin\n\nMerwin implores us to see that “the past is not finished / here in the present / it is awake the whole time.” The poet’s recollections include the texture of his mother’s hand at the piano, the image of an old dog running in the hills “like an unmoored flame,” the graciousness of a roofer named Duporte, now long dead. But the act of remembering always takes place amid natural as well as personal history: Merwin’s poetry has an ecological awareness that he sharpened through decades of work restoring and conserving palm trees in Hawaii. His careful stewardship of local flora helps make these poems’ descriptions—of the passing days and returning seasons; of birds and trees; of his wife, Paula, and the life they made together—tangible. That same tactile quality is what makes these verses’ sadness at the finality of loss so pointed.\n\nThe Shadow of Sirius By W. S. Merwin\n\n22\n\nNox\n\nBy Anne Carson\n\nThe uncontainable grief animating Nox is mirrored in its presentation: not a bound book, but a sinuous, accordion-folded pamphlet spilling out of its box, simulating the notebook that Carson assembled after the death of her distant brother, Michael. “WHO WERE YOU,” Nox cries out. That anguished scribble appears among photographs, handwritten notes, and typed thoughts. Beside these are cards defining and investigating Latin words; Carson, a classicist, is at the same time attempting to translate a poem by the Roman poet Catullus about his brother, who also died far from home. This magpie’s collection of ideas and images conveys that there is no clear, unbroken story to tell about a brother whom Carson hardly knew as an adult. She is aware that these emotions have been felt before, but that doesn’t diminish her sorrow. She pulls on the thread that connects her to Catullus and a community of mourners as old as human history, one that we all belong to or will eventually join.\n\nNox By Anne Carson\n\n21\n\nLife on Mars\n\nBy Tracy K. Smith\n\nSmith, a former poet laureate of the United States, is deeply concerned with history and place. Yet she begins Life on Mars by imagining a completely new, futuristic world, in which humans sail along “in the haze of space” among chrome aesthetics and “clean lines pointed only forward.” In this science-fiction universe, “history, with its hard spine & dog-eared / Corners, will be replaced by nuance.” The trappings of the genre allow Smith to conjure a life unmoored from what came before—but briefly: It turns out that space isn’t all that far from home. Smith soon starts writing about her father, an engineer who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope, and orbits the massive, superdense hole left by his death, while clinging to moments of beauty and a kind of agnostic optimism. In one poem, the victims of high-profile murders write postcards to their assailants from some unknown hereafter. In another, which imagines her father’s “ride beyond the body,” Smith muses hopefully that “he is only gone so far as we can tell.”\n\nLife on Mars By Tracy K. Smith\n\n20\n\nOne With Others\n\nBy C. D. Wright\n\nIn a town Wright calls Big Tree, Arkansas, in the late 1960s, a group of Black schoolchildren were arrested and detained in a dry swimming pool for staging a walkout from their all-Black school. Wright, who was born in the region, stitches together found materials from locals, reconstructing “the memories summoned and branded into their histories” to form a kind of poetic documentary. She creates a particularly vivid picture of V, a white woman whose full name was Margaret Kaelin McHugh—someone who “woke up in a rage, eight days a week” and was so horrified by the event that she later joined a civil-rights march to Little Rock. In response, she was violently expelled from her family and community. One With Others is an experimental collage of voices that becomes a groundbreaking testament—a record of small-town racism and an elegiac biography of a flawed, courageous individual.\n\nOne With Others By C. D. Wright\n\n19\n\nPostcolonial Love Poem\n\nBy Natalie Diaz\n\nSince 1754, when Benjamin Franklin published a political cartoon imploring the American colonies to “JOIN, or DIE,” the rattlesnake has been “a classic American character in a classic American font,” as Diaz puts it in her poem “Snake-Light.” Franklin’s image referenced folklore that suggested a cut-up snake would be reanimated if its parts were reunited before sunset. But in Postcolonial Love Poem, the brutality committed in the name of our nation’s founding has not healed. Diaz, an enrolled member of the Gila River Indian Community, refracts our country’s origin story through the blood of its chosen sacrifices, the rattlesnake just one among many. The Mojave poet’s collection is awash in scenes of conquest, depletion, and profound yearning; animals perish, rivers dry up, people burn with lust for one another in the absence of other sustenance. Yet each of the poems feels alive, pointing to the fact that our foundational myths can still be reconsidered—and that Indigenous people are still here to rewrite them.\n\nPostcolonial Love Poem By Natalie Diaz\n\n18\n\nCatalog of Unabashed Gratitude\n\nBy Ross Gay\n\nSweetness recurs in Gay’s collection, in the form of abundant fruit—figs, pears, berries—and in the dominant emotion of these poems: joy. Here, even death is transformed into the syrupy juice of a stone fruit dripping down a chin. Gay describes sprinkling his father’s ashes at the base of a tree and then finding the dead man’s spirit transferred into its bounty, “almost dancing now in the plum, / in the tree, the way he did as a person.” The poems are redolent of spring, full of verdant growth and birdsong. Perhaps such happy poetry shouldn’t be so unusual, but Gay’s odes to such everyday pleasures as sleeping in his clothes or drinking water from his hands bring a rare satisfaction. “Friends this is the realest place I know, / it makes me squirm like a worm I am so grateful,” he writes in one poem, and this sentiment captures it all, both the cheerful squirming and the gratitude simply for being alive.\n\nCatalog of Unabashed Gratitude By Ross Gay\n\n17\n\nBright Dead Things\n\nBy Ada Limón\n\nThe best way to describe Limón’s poetry, perhaps, is saturated: Emotions run through it undiluted and her language is simple, yet full to bursting. Bright Dead Things is laced with these qualities. “I am beautiful. I am full of love. I am dying,” she writes in one of several poems about the death of her stepmother. Repeatedly in these pages, Limón plays with scope and blunt imagery to produce moments of humanistic insight. The physicality of illness, rendered almost dryly and at industrial scale, becomes strangely moving: “Her job, / her work, was to let the machine / of survival break down, / make the factory fail.” A detail about a partner’s preference for “a lot of washcloths, / the small, cheap kind / for every day you’re alive” turns the most domestic of predilections into a memento of a life lived in tandem. Limón’s great gift is her bracing comfort with being earnest. “I’m thirty-five and remember all that I’ve done wrong,” she writes at one point, reminding us that her plainspoken observations are a form of generosity.\n\nBright Dead Things By Ada Limón\n\n16\n\nLook\n\nBy Solmaz Sharif\n\nUsing the Department of Defense’s Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms to deliver a fierce critique of America’s War on Terror, Sharif deploys terms such as hostile environment and diversion in surprising ways. Sometimes these reclamations have nothing to do with war; they crop up, for instance, in reflections on a dinner party, or during a swim in a friend’s father’s pool. The appropriated words, distinguished in the text in small caps, shed light on the euphemistic, sterile language used to describe the atrocities of combat. Sharif’s poems also examine how violence can carve out gaping holes in language. A series of seven poems in the middle of Look appear as doctored letters from a woman to her husband, who is being detained in Guantánamo. These verses of love and pining are made more devastating by the absences they contain; their redactions reflect the blank space the speaker’s husband left behind. Sharif demands that her readers—especially Americans who live thousands of miles away from the destruction—stare directly at the costs of war.\n\nLook By Solmaz Sharif\n\n15\n\nSlow Lightning\n\nBy Eduardo C. Corral\n\nSlow Lightning evokes the U.S.-Mexico border and the difficulties of undocumented life as if they exist on a liminal plane; deserts, snakes, lovers, and cacti recur throughout, as does the notion of living in between. One poem, dedicated to Frida Kahlo’s painting The Broken Column, moves between eagle-eyed analysis of Kahlo’s artistry and musings on the perfect shade of red. Like Kahlo’s work, Corral’s verse is shaped with a painterly eye: His lines are more impressionistic than narrative, as if he’s stringing together images with thin, wispy brush strokes. Nothing is static here: Humor is invoked to mask suffering. “Sapo shits behind a cluster of nopales,” Corral writes in a poem about two friends crossing the border, “& shouts out our favorite joke, No tengo papeles!” (“I don’t have papers.”) Sometimes lines are peppered across the page, instead of beginning by the left margin; other times a whole poem is turned sideways. English sentences slip into Spanish. The result is a collection that tells no tidy stories, dropping readers instead into a swirling, shadowy dream world.\n\nSlow Lightning By Eduardo C. Corral\n\n14\n\nThe Tradition\n\nBy Jericho Brown\n\nIn The Tradition, Brown catalogs the ills of American society—police brutality, mass shootings—and immerses the reader in the physical pain that they cause, bringing up images of wounds dressed with tar and bullets tucked in brain folds. His precise and spare language leaves little room for error, a credit to the poet’s power. Appearing sporadically in the collection are a series of poems called duplexes—a form Brown invented as a way of “gutting” the traditional sonnet by mixing in the blues and the Arabic ghazal. Each duplex is composed of seven couplets in which the first line of each pair echoes and twists the second line of the previous one: “Men roam shirtless as if none ever hurt me. / Men roam that myth. In truth, one hurt me.” Often, the last line of the poem also folds back into the very first. Through this construction, Brown hints at the cyclical nature of American progress: Stepping forward, in the duplex, is always accompanied by a step back.\n\nThe Tradition By Jericho Brown\n\n13\n\nMan and Camel\n\nBy Mark Strand\n\nThis book starts with a series of fables that a grandmother might tell to a tired child: There’s a king who no longer wants to rule; a man who goes to pick up a cake and never comes home; a polar explorer who encounters a spectral figure he seems to know; a camel who sings. These are followed by a concluding set of personal meditations that riff on the seven sayings of Christ on the cross. Each of these somnolent vignettes immerses us in a world from which the meaning seems to have escaped just a short time ago, leaving behind a somber landscape of tantalizing symbols: “If the moon could speak, what would it say? / If the moon could speak, it would say nothing.” Death and loss color the tone and texture of the poems, but Strand still gives his visions a cryptic, enthralling beauty. Take the final poem’s descent to a moonlit sea: “a place of constant beginning that has within it / what no eye has seen.”\n\nMan and Camel By Mark Strand\n\n12\n\nOlio\n\nBy Tyehimba Jess\n\nOlio—the word refers to the second half of a minstrel show, a variety act that eventually became known as vaudeville—features more than a dozen real and fictional Black musicians, all of whom are the first generation of their family not to be enslaved. These artists, including Scott Joplin, the ragtime piano player, are caught at the intersection between Black art-making and white profiteering. Jess’s songbook contains sonnets, interviews, letters, pages to unfold and tear out, and forms of the poet’s own invention, such as the “duet” poems that stage two voices in parallel columns of text. Olio’s virtuosic spectacle is a performance put together as carefully as any of its characters’ work. As a whole, it examines art’s sometimes-uneasy, ambiguous relationship to freedom.\n\nOlio By Tyehimba Jess\n\n11\n\nStag’s Leap\n\nBy Sharon Olds\n\nBy 2012, when Olds published this collection about her husband leaving her, she’d already been divorced for more than 10 years. Yet the marriage had lasted more than 30, meaning she had a lot left to unpack. Stag’s Leap traces the long arc of her own healing, vacillating among disbelief, shame, nostalgia, and gratitude. Olds is remarkably generous to her ex: “When anyone escapes, my heart / leaps up,” she writes in the title poem. “Even when it’s I who am escaped from, / I am half on the side of the leaver.” But she’s gentle with herself, too, holding her heartache up to the light with nonjudgmental curiosity. Olds comes away with a profound, and widely applicable, reflection about the impossibility of truly knowing someone at all—and the sometimes-foolhardy bravery required to try anyway. These poems are a perfect example of what Olds does best: She makes you blush, then laugh, then cry.\n\nStag’s Leap By Sharon Olds\n\n10\n\nfrank: sonnets\n\nBy Diane Seuss\n\nSonnets impose a welcome constraint on poetry, which Seuss takes as a challenge, stretching the form to its limits across 127 poems. In languid sentences, Seuss manages to fit a full life into her book, collecting snippets from her midwestern childhood and her youthful romps in New York City. Her poems squint and fearlessly examine death: She writes of her father’s tumor, her son’s life-threatening struggles with addiction, and the early demise of a cherished friend. These events lead Seuss to think on her own mortality, yet her ontological probing is balanced by an awe for the minutiae of modern human life. She might describe a house as “covered in the pollen / of Cheetos dust.” She devotes as much reverence to poetic abstractions as to quotidian details such as Q-tips, Jack Nicholson in Chinatown, or “chips, dip, pizza rolls.” Over time, she comes to view the end with more wonder than terror. As she writes in the book’s final sonnet: “When it happens I don’t want to be afraid I / want to be curious.”\n\nfrank: sonnets By Diane Seuss\n\n9\n\nDeaf Republic\n\nBy Ilya Kaminsky\n\nAt the beginning of the play-in-verse that largely makes up Deaf Republic, soldiers enter a square in the fictional town of Vasenka, in an unidentified country perhaps inspired by Kaminsky’s own childhood in Soviet Ukraine. People have gathered to watch a puppet show, and as soldiers attempt to disperse the crowd, a deaf boy is shot. The next day, the townspeople adopt deafness in protest; they refuse to hear the soldiers, and they develop their own sign language, illustrated in drawings throughout the collection. “The deaf don’t believe in silence,” Kaminsky, himself hard of hearing, writes. “Silence is the invention of the hearing.” Soldiers “arrive in Vasenka to ‘protect our freedom,’ speaking a language no one understands.” And yet there is love, joy, tenderness—a newlywed couple welcoming a baby, the baby learning to walk. Bookending the two-act play are two poems set in the United States, where Kaminsky lives now as a citizen—and where many, too, wrestle with the power and protection found in silences, chosen or imposed.\n\nDeaf Republic By Ilya Kaminsky\n\n8\n\nTime and Materials\n\nBy Robert Hass\n\nBefore this collection, much of Hass’s work focused on concrete, everyday details: seasons, scents, sex, changing light, singing birds. Time and Materials is both different and not. Hass is still concerned with the immediate, but also with how the small scenes he’s mastered are the building blocks of even the most lofty and abstract concepts. In one poem, he marvels at Vermeer’s famous painting The Milkmaid—how incredibly alive those “thin strips of paint on three hundred year old canvas” are—and then flits to describing a lover: the vein in her neck, the small hairs on her lower back. He is creating something like a portrait. His point isn’t only to separate major ideas into their constituent pieces; rather, he wonders at how the world manages to be so much greater than the sum of its parts. Perhaps he’s defending, too, writing that interests itself not only in “time” but in “materials”—the stuff from which existence is built.\n\nTime and Materials By Robert Hass\n\n7\n\nFaithful and Virtuous Night\n\nBy Louise Glück\n\nFaithful and Virtuous Night is the culmination of Glück’s long and lauded career: a collection of poems by a woman in her early 70s, looking back at life with the clarifying vision that time can bring. What Glück sees first is childhood, its innocent joys, “sheets printed with colored sailboats,” birds and insects, summer days. Then, as the loop of years closes, she also sees old age, its frailties and confusions, its finalities—“It came to me one night as I was falling asleep / that I had finished with those amorous adventures / to which I had long been a slave.” Many of the poems shimmer as if illuminated by moonlight, dreamy and ruminative. She is taking account of the ephemerality of human existence, and in one poem, an airplane ride becomes a metaphor for an entire life. Near its end: “I will be brief. This concludes, / as the stewardess says / our short flight. / And all the persons one will never know / crowd into the aisle, and all are funneled / into the terminal.”\n\nFaithful and Virtuous Night By Louise Glück\n\n6\n\nCrush\n\nBy Richard Siken\n\nInfatuation is one of life’s glorious mysteries: At peak intensity, it can spin out of control, teetering from beautiful to frightening. This might be the double meaning of Crush, Siken’s poetry collection about longing: Like a volcano, desire is awesome but destructive. Siken describes it at times as a source of stigma, self-hatred, or material danger. “The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater / because he is trying to kill you / and you deserve it,” he writes, “because you wanted to touch his hands and lips.” But the only greater threat than love’s power is the possibility that it’s not powerful enough—that it can’t stop time, or overwrite humankind’s mundane cruelties. Siken is a patron saint for those who feel deeply, and he lays it all out, raw but tender, in the first poem: “Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake / and dress them in warm clothes again … Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. / These, our bodies, possessed by light. / Tell me we’ll never get used to it.”\n\nCrush By Richard Siken\n\n5\n\nWhereas\n\nBy Layli Long Soldier\n\n“Everything is in the language we use,” Long Soldier notes in Whereas. “For example, a treaty is … a contract between two sovereign nations.” But treaties between the United States and Native nations failed to recognize the equal footing inherent to that definition, she reminds us. In the first part of this meticulous collection, Long Soldier defines and redefines words in English and Lakota, approaching both tongues with modesty and immense care. In the second, she offers a point-by-point response to a 2009 governmental “Resolution of Apology to Native Peoples,” mirroring its “whereas” statements, which, as she demonstrates, claim to establish facts but instead obscure them. She uses erasure to excise words, either to reveal their emptiness or to build truer sentences, resulting in lines such as “I recognize that official ill-breaking of the Indian”; at another point, she interposes her father’s contrition to show you what a proper apology looks like. “I climb the backs of languages, ride them to exhaustion,” she writes with wry self-recognition. What she mostly does, though, is bring dead language back to life.\n\nWhereas By Layli Long Soldier\n\n4\n\nNative Guard\n\nBy Natasha Trethewey\n\nThe title poem in Trethewey’s book, named for a unit of Black soldiers called into Union service during the Civil War, transports readers back to November 1862, when the regiment was guarding Confederate captives on a Mississippi island. Even while heading into combat, Trethewey’s formerly enslaved narrator is concerned with keeping alive lessons from the past: “I thought to carry with me / want of freedom though I had been freed, / remembrance not constant recollection.” More than a century later, in the mid-1960s, Trethewey was born on the mainland, about 12 miles from that same Union fort. Native Guard is at once an elegy for these often-forgotten Black men and an intimate meditation on how the Civil War and the legacy of slavery shaped Trethewey’s early life. The book travels back and forth in time, sometimes in the span of one poem, and the author opts to converse directly with the soldiers or with her late mother, whose interracial marriage was still illegal at the time of Trethewey’s birth. Native Guard rejects the comfort of linear storytelling, offering a more honest, visceral account in its place.\n\nNative Guard By Natasha Trethewey\n\n3\n\nNight Sky With Exit Wounds\n\nBy Ocean Vuong\n\nVuong’s collection depicts scenes of obliterating violence and juxtaposes them with the deep, human desire to survive. Night Sky With Exit Wounds moves across years and the globe, traversing the sidewalks of Saigon and the cornfields of America, always pairing brutality with mundanity: Pigeons peck at bread near a bombed bakery, monarch butterflies fly through a prison cell. Vuong approaches language without pretense and treats it anew each time. He delights in surprising turns of phrase, branching into different worlds, often within the same poem or even the same line. Specific words—tongue, snow, holy, body, country, colt—repeat and re-form themselves among poems, taking on multiple meanings or calling back to earlier moments. His work reminds us that beauty can come from suffering, and that, sometimes, the two blend together.\n\nNight Sky With Exit Wounds By Ocean Vuong\n\n2\n\nAmerican Sonnets for my Past and Future Assassin\n\nBy Terrance Hayes\n\nHayes wrote this collection shortly after Donald Trump’s first electoral victory, and nearly every page is imbued with his emotional response as he catalogs his anger, fear, ambivalence, and even, at times, love. Each of these 70 poems is titled “American Sonnet for My Past and Future Assassin,” and each uses its stark, metered lines to contend with the country’s present and historical bigotry. In some of the sonnets, Hayes confronts the “assassin,” a figure who takes many forms—white supremacists such as Dylann Roof, or the men whose faces appear on the money he carries. “You will never assassinate my ghosts,” he writes. The book also includes gentler verse; in one sonnet Hayes writes about the “things I love in the face / Of James Baldwin … The sashay / Between left & right / eyebrow, for example.” In another, he notes with quiet pride that he learned to cut his own hair after his father left. But even these poems feel like they’re on the edge of violence, almost bursting out of their contained form. His collection is a powerful record of a turning point in American history and an argument that the insidious “assassin” of the poems can look like anyone—even ourselves.\n\nAmerican Sonnets for my Past and Future Assassin By Terrance Hayes\n\n1\n\nCitizen\n\nBy Claudia Rankine\n\nMany parts of Citizen, Rankine’s “American Lyric,” might not initially register as poetry: video stills, paintings, photographs, long sections of prose. But they function as poetry because they distill a universe of history, experience, thought, and feeling into a taut whole. Rankine presents future writers with a menu of techniques for turning the media of the moment into poetry that addresses both the urgent and the eternal. When describing hostile, racist comments or police brutality, she uses the second person to expand the lyric form, traditionally personal and confessional, into a means of holding an array of stories, many (or maybe most) of them not her own: “You are not sick, you are injured,” she says, invoking racism’s effects on the body while focusing on those doing the harm. Between these episodes are interludes of airier verse that soars or sighs. At first, the “you” of the book holds her tongue in response to many slights, seeking solace in, for example, a tennis match—only to see Serena Williams lash out over a bad call after years of forbearance. The poet, like the player, ultimately repudiates the silencing impulse: “The world is wrong. You can’t put the past behind you. It’s buried in you.” Tension builds and then explodes. But beauty also abounds—moonlight, rain, a partner’s touch, and the pleasure of a few words, perfectly arranged.\n\nCitizen: An American Lyric By Claudia Rankine",

        "title": "Trump Is Deporting ‘Them’ in Ways That Threaten Us",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Early in American history, James Madison, the chief architect of the Constitution, warned that when the federal government seizes new powers to target foreign nationals, the rights of American citizens are at risk. The year was 1798, a time of tension with France. President John Adams was about to sign the Alien and Sedition Acts, including the Alien Enemies Act––the law the Trump administration is now citing to justify deporting hundreds of people to a brutal prison in El Salvador without due process.\n\nMadison summed up his concerns in a letter to Thomas Jefferson. “The management of foreign relations appears to be the most susceptible of abuse of all the trusts committed to a Government,” he wrote, noting the state’s ability to conceal facts in that realm or to share them selectively. “Perhaps it is a universal truth,” he continued, “that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to provisions against danger real or pretended from abroad.”\n\nHis concern would prove to be justified on many different occasions in ensuing centuries. And it is newly relevant today, thanks to the Trump administration’s capricious, spectacle-driven treatment of foreign nationals, some here legally, others illegally. The White House has assured the public that individuals it is deporting or trying to deport are terrible people––vicious criminals or even terrorists. But in many of those cases, it has presented little or no evidence to back up its claims, and appears to be denying due process to contest or disprove them. The administration is also targeting some people for mere speech, which it casts as evidence of terrorist sympathies.\n\nRead: The ultimate Trump story\n\nThese moves don’t just hurt foreigners; as Madison warned, they threaten Americans too, eroding the very foundations of our liberty. The Constitution imposes limits on the state in order to guard against rights violations and restrain would-be tyrants. The most important limits on state power include the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition on denying due process to anyone and the First Amendment’s prohibition on any law abridging free speech. If the legitimacy of Trump’s actions is ceded because his targets are unsympathetic foreigners, those powers will be deployed against citizens eventually.\n\nWhat’s more, when the legality of the administration’s deportations has been challenged, Trump, his appointees, and some of his most powerful supporters have seemingly defied judicial orders or urged the impeachment of judges, risking a constitutional crisis that threatens another core protection against tyranny: the separation of government powers into coequal branches.\n\nRead: Stephen Miller has a plan\n\nImmigration enforcement needn’t be this way. Trump was reelected with a popular mandate to deport immigrants here illegally. He could easily do so without threatening our open society. President Barack Obama deported more than 3 million people without incurring that cost. Yet, for all Trump’s “America First” rhetoric, he is choosing to target foreigners in ways that imperil the rights of Americans and the rule of law.\n\nTwo particular administration actions are illustrative.\n\nFirst is Trump’s recent invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport 238 Venezuelans. The act says that during war or when an “invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened,” aliens from the enemy country can be removed. Madison used the law during the war of 1812, Woodrow Wilson used it against German nationals during World War I, and Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked it during World War II, prior to the forced internment of American citizens, the quintessential vindication of Madison’s warning. Today, the United States confronts nothing so dangerous as the Axis powers. The Trump administration is invoking this fraught law to target Venezuelans at a time when the United States is not even at war with Venezuela; it claims that the Venezuelan gang in question “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion” against the United States.\n\nBy the administration’s own admission, many of the 238 people swept up by federal agents had no criminal record here. Despite this, the Trump administration detained the individuals and put them on planes. Even after an order from a federal judge to stop the flights, U.S. officials turned the Venezuelans over to authorities in El Salvador. The deportees had no chance to argue that they weren’t in the gang in question, as lawyers and members of some of their families claim, or to challenge their removal in court. The United States isn’t even sending these deportees back to their country of origin; it is paying El Salvador to hold them for at least a year in a prison known for harsh treatment. In terms of due process, “Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act,” another federal judge who reviewed the matter said on Monday. (Yesterday, a federal appeals court upheld a block on the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang.)\n\nIf legal residents who broke no laws are among the deported, or if American citizens are swept up in a future deportation carried out in the same take-our-word-for-it way, how would anyone know? This is not a speculative worry: The Government Accountability Office has found that from 2015 to 2020, “ICE arrested 674, detained 121, and removed 70 potential U.S. citizens.” Allowing due-process-free deportations of mere suspects sets a precedent that risks an American one day winding up in a foreign prison cell.\n\nSecond, Trump administration officials are targeting foreigners who came here legally—with student visas, H1-B visas, or green cards—because of their speech supporting Palestine and criticizing Israel. The most prominent target so far is Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder and recent graduate student at Columbia University who participated in pro-Palestinian activism and was a lead negotiator on behalf of student protesters. The Trump administration alleges that he is a supporter of Hamas, a charge that his attorney has denied, and many of his critics allege that his activism at Columbia included unlawful actions. If that is accurate, Khalil could be charged with a crime, convicted, and removed on that basis without the First Amendment being undermined. Instead the Trump administration detained him without charging him criminally or presenting any evidence connecting him to Hamas. (This week, it added new arguments for deportation: that on his green-card application, Khalil allegedly failed to disclose his work for or membership in a group at Columbia that favors divestment from Israel, the British embassy in Beirut, and the United Nations refugee agency for Palestinians; lawyers for Khalil are challenging his detention.)\n\nAnother person federal officers have tried to detain is Yunseo Chung, a Columbia student. “The Trump administration is arguing that her presence in the United States hinders the administration’s foreign policy agenda of halting the spread of antisemitism,” The New York Times reported. According to the Times, Chung, who left South Korea for the United States when she was 7 and was valedictorian of her high school, joined in but did not lead campus pro-Palestine demonstrations. Chung has filed a lawsuit challenging the attempt to arrest and deport her, arguing that the First Amendment protects her speech. The lawsuit states that earlier this month she attended a demonstration outside a campus building to protest what she saw as excessive punishments for student protesters. “Ms. Chung was arrested and given a Desk Appearance Ticket,” it adds, “a common citation issued by the police at protests.” That ticket has not yet been adjudicated.\n\nThe administration is targeting these legal residents and others, it appears, only because of their pro-Palestine, anti-Israel viewpoint—a viewpoint that the government conflates with support for Hamas and therefore for terrorism. While campaigning in New York last year, Trump declared, in reference to contemporaneous campus protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza, “One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country.” If Trump, as president, can violate the First Amendment’s prohibition on viewpoint discrimination when it comes to foreign students, Americans lose that limit on state power too. Even the anti-immigrant firebrand Ann Coulter objected to the administration’s actions. “There’s almost no one I don’t want to deport,” she wrote on X, “but, unless they’ve committed a crime, isn’t this a violation of the first amendment?”\n\nGraeme Wood: The kind of thing dictators do\n\nIn all of this, Trump is prioritizing what is bad for foreigners over what’s good for Americans. Partisans are cheering him on, arguing that the foreigners in question are bad people who are receiving harsh treatment because they “deserve” it. A more patriotic approach would focus on what American citizens deserve.\n\nAmericans deserve immigration officials who are transparent about what they do and why, not officials who offer no explanation, or conflicting explanations, for detentions and deportations. Americans deserve Homeland Security officials who are focused more on terrorists than on searching dorm rooms. And Americans deserve a president who supports a free-speech culture, obeys court orders, and fulfills rather than violates his oath by offering due process before depriving anyone of liberty. As the historian Timothy Snyder recently wrote, “If you are a citizen and you are casting doubt on the importance of due process, remember this: you need due process in order to prove that you are a citizen.”\n\nTo focus on what Americans deserve is not to imply that foreigners don’t deserve just and lawful treatment as an end in itself. Nor is it to imagine that their lives can be cleanly disentangled from those of citizens. Americans work for and hire foreigners. We date and marry them, as Trump himself did. Mistreatment of them affects us too.\n\nStill, a president has no higher duty than to protect and defend the Constitution, that most indispensable guarantor of our rights and ability to self-govern, and to serve the citizens he represents. The current president is derelict in that highest duty; he is spending more energy undermining the rights of foreigners than conserving the rights of his countrymen.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., staring down his first major health crisis as the head of Health and Human Services, had a plan. After Texas experienced the first measles death in the United States in a decade, Kennedy told Fox earlier this month that the federal government was delivering vitamin A—an unproven treatment that Kennedy has promoted as an alternative to vaccines—to measles-stricken communities in West Texas “right now.” But a Texas official told me this week that no doses of vitamin A have arrived at the state health department—not because RFK Jr. broke his promise, but because Texas doctors didn’t ask for them.\n\nThe doses are available “if we need them,” Lara Anton, the senior press officer for the state public-health department, told me in a statement. But her office, she said, has not requested any, “because healthcare providers have not requested it from us.” Anton had no records of any shipments of vitamin A, budesonide, clarithromycin, or cod-liver oil—all of which Kennedy has said can help with measles—even though the state has received 1,760 additional vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella from the federal government since the middle of February.\n\nWhen I asked Anton if Texas officials thought vitamin A treatment was useless, she referred me to a state website, which reads, “Vitamin A cannot prevent measles. Vitamin A may be useful as a supplemental treatment once someone has a measles infection, especially if they have a severe case of measles or low vitamin A levels and are under the care of a doctor.” The local health department for Gaines County, the epicenter of the deadly outbreak, told me that it has not received any of the alternative treatments either. (HHS did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn just a few short weeks on the job, Kennedy has broken with decades of public-health precedent in responding to measles. In a March 2 op-ed for Fox, he acknowledged that vaccines “not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity”—only after emphasizing that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He has also endorsed vitamin A, which is not FDA-approved to treat measles, as a way to substantially decrease deaths from the disease. Vitamin A can reduce the risk of death among children under 2 who are infected, according to a 2005 meta-analysis. However, it has not been shown to effectively prevent the disease, contrary to Kennedy’s claim in his Fox interview.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that a health department wouldn’t want shipments of unproven treatments. But Texas’s decision to deny an offer of help from the top federal health official during a deadly measles outbreak suggests that not everyone in the nation’s public-health apparatus is ready to fall in line behind Kennedy’s unfounded claims. That apparently includes some staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which falls under Kennedy’s purview. On Tuesday, the CDC’s top communications officer announced his resignation in an op-ed lambasting Kennedy’s embrace of alternative measles treatments. Public records I’ve gathered from Texas show that CDC staff are aiding at least one local health department in spreading pro-vaccine messages to the local community. In a series of emails with Texas health workers, for instance, CDC officials workshopped multiple pro-vaccine public-service announcements and helped translate them into Low German and Spanish. “The best way to protect against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine,” one flyer read. And a letter from the local health-department executive director, Zachary Holbrooks, that was distributed to parents of unvaccinated schoolchildren stated: “I strongly encourage you to have your child vaccinated as soon as possible.” None of the materials I obtained made any mention of vitamin A.\n\nIt’s unclear if those pro-vaccine messages are convincing locals, particularly the Mennonite population at the center of Texas’s outbreak. Last school year, just under 82 percent of kindergarteners in Gaines County were vaccinated against measles. Data from the state’s vaccine registry suggest that immunizations are up roughly 10 percent this year compared with the same period in 2024, although Texas has limited visibility on vaccine administration. Holbrooks recently told The Atlantic that three local Mennonite churches had refused the district health department’s request to place a measles-testing site on their property. Meanwhile, residents are clearing out local drugstores’ supplies of vitamin A and cod-liver oil, and showing up to a makeshift clinic that is giving out cod-liver oil. This week, The New York Times reported that some children in the area are taking such high doses of vitamin A that they are showing signs of liver damage.\n\nAfter casting a key vote to confirm Kennedy as health secretary, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican, told his colleagues that Kennedy would help with “restoring trust in our public-health institutions.” But Kennedy has already made that laudable goal even less achievable. So long as the nation’s top public-health official is propping up purported miracle cures, families in West Texas will be encouraged to believe that not vaccinating their children is a responsible choice. Public-health leaders can’t fix that problem on their own, even if they refuse to play along with Kennedy’s pseudoscientific routine.",

        "title": "The Double Standard at the Center of the Signal Debacle",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "In the telling of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, he was only executing his duties when he shared plans about a forthcoming attack on Yemen in an unclassified group chat on the Signal messaging app. “My job,” he told reporters during a swing through Hawaii, “is to provide updates in real time.”\n\nThe implication: Nothing to see here.\n\nThe reaction inside the Pentagon to Hegseth’s communications—disclosed this week by The Atlantic after the editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to the chat—told a different story, as security specialists raced to reiterate rules about the proper channels for classified information.\n\n“Incidents like this make my job significantly harder,” a Department of Defense operations security, or OPSEC, official told us this week, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. “When senior leadership disregards OPSEC and security protocols without consequences, it undermines the work we do to enforce these standards.”\n\nRead: Trump goes after the messenger\n\nThe OPSEC official added, “Now we have to spend hours retraining and reiterating rules to personnel who see these double standards and question why they should be held accountable when leadership is not.”\n\nIn the days since The Atlantic published the contents of the group chat, a gulf has opened between the public posture adopted by senior members of the administration and the private reaction of rank-and-file national-security officials aghast at the severity of the breach and troubled by the lack of repercussions. The disparity is likely to deepen if Donald Trump continues to resist holding anyone accountable.\n\nThe president’s instructions to his team late this week remained to attack Goldberg and The Atlantic, and not “produce a scalp” by firing any members of his Cabinet, in the words of one outside adviser consulted by the White House who described the discussions to us. Senior Democrats have called on both Hegseth and the president’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who created the Signal group and added Goldberg, to resign or be fired.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to rule out the possibility of terminations but told reporters this week that Trump “continues to have confidence in his national-security team.” Trump, speaking in the Oval Office yesterday, said of his defense secretary, “Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this.” And the White House today confirmed plans for Waltz to join Vice President J. D. Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, on a visit to Greenland, in an apparent show of confidence in the national security adviser.\n\nIn Congress, the reactions mostly reflected partisan differences, with some exceptions.\n\nSenator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined the panel’s top Democrat, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, in asking the Defense Department’s acting inspector general to investigate the incident. The acting inspector general, Steven A. Stebbins, was appointed principal deputy inspector general in 2023, under President Joe Biden, and took over leadership of the office on an acting basis following Trump’s dismissal of the inspector general, Robert Storch, in January—part of a broad expulsion of inspectors general.\n\nIt’s not clear whether or how quickly an investigation will take place. A spokesperson for the inspector general’s office confirmed receipt of the request and told us it was being reviewed.\n\nIt’s also not clear whether there will be other investigations. In response to questioning this week before the Senate and House intelligence panels, FBI Director Kash Patel declined to say whether he would open an investigation. At an unrelated news conference earlier today, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, dismissed the prospect of an investigation. Bondi echoed Trump-administration talking points in describing the contents of the Signal chat as “sensitive information, not classified,” and sought to shift the focus to the success of the mission in Yemen. She then blamed Hillary Clinton and Biden for mishandling classified information. Both politicians faced probes into their conduct by the Justice Department, the agency traditionally responsible for enforcing the Espionage Act and other federal laws governing national defense information.\n\nWicker, speaking to reporters this week, said he believed that the information shared in the chat should have been classified, contradicting senior Trump-administration officials who insisted they had heeded classification rules. But Wicker stopped short of calling for resignations. So, too, did Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who described the conduct as an “egregious security breach” that should serve as a “wake-up call.” Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska also delivered a blunt assessment, calling the Signal chat a “gross error.”\n\nRepresentative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, told us that his Republican colleagues are more concerned about the breach than they let on publicly.\n\n“I think they are much more concerned privately, because they saw the text messages just as I did,” he said in an interview. “They saw the unredacted messages, and they are astonishing.”\n\nKrishnamoorthi also said that the breach has broken through to the public in a way that demands consequences. “They want to know that there’s a uniform application of the law,” the lawmaker told us. According to a YouGov poll released this week, 60 percent of Republicans view the conduct by Trump officials in the Signal chat as somewhat or very serious. Nearly 90 percent of Democrats said the same.\n\nSome conservative influencers broke ranks to warn of public perceptions about the incident. In a lengthy video posted to his more than 3.6 million followers on X, Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, called on Trump to fire someone. “Somebody has to go down,” he said. Tomi Lahren, another popular conservative-media personality, took issue with the administration’s efforts to draw a distinction between “war plans” and “attack plans,” and to imply that the latter is less sensitive. “Trying to wordsmith the hell outta this signal debacle is making it worse,” she wrote on X. “It was bad. And I’m honestly getting sick of the whataboutisms from my own side. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has been angered by negative news coverage that he believes paints his White House as sloppy and that has distracted from his plans to implement further tariffs on American trading partners, two aides told us. Inside the White House, the episode brought back memories of the scandal surrounding Mike Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser in the early days of his first term, as the president’s aides vowed to ensure a different outcome this time around. Flynn was forced to resign in February 2017 after he was revealed to have lied to then–Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\n\nListen: Classified, or not classified?\n\nTrump, who loathes admitting errors or issuing apologies, has expressed private regret about Flynn’s dismissal and has told advisers over the years that he thinks he gave up too easily. Some in the president’s orbit don’t want another national security adviser thrown overboard so quickly.\n\nStill, some Trump allies believe that Waltz is more vulnerable than the secretary of defense. The bare-knuckle fight to get Hegseth narrowly confirmed reminded the president’s supporters of the push to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which became a significant victory for the MAGA movement. Hegseth is also receiving the most heat from Democrats, which may make the GOP more likely to try to rally around him. Waltz, meanwhile, is viewed with more suspicion by some of the president’s loyalists, who are directing blame at him not for initiating the Signal chat but for seeming to have the contact details of a journalist stored in his phone. (He has denied this while not explaining how he came to add Goldberg to the chat.)\n\nTrump advisers expressed anger toward Wicker and other Republicans on the Hill who have broken ranks. As a contrast, they held up Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican and longtime national-security hawk, who declared that no one should lose their job over the Signal debacle.\n\nGraham’s reward came last night in the form of a presidential endorsement on Truth Social in his reelection race, which is more than a year away: “Lindsey has been a wonderful friend to me, and has always been there when I needed him.”",

        "title": "Why Sheinbaum Can Surrender to Trump",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Canadian and European leaders push back against the U.S. because they have to listen to their voters. Mexico’s leader faces no penalty for ignoring hers.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nIn her public appearances and on social media, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has become a symbol of fearless resistance to the Trump administration’s bullying. She has delivered defiant speeches before huge crowds. When Trump trolled her nation with his “Gulf of America” stunt, she trolled right back: At a press conference, she displayed an antique map that labeled most of the present-day United States as “Mexican America.”\n\nHer methods have appeared to gain a measure of respect. Almost alone among U.S. allies and partners, Mexico has been spared Donald Trump’s barrage of insults and threats. Canada is mocked almost daily. The administration expresses intentions to annex Greenland and the Panama Canal Zone. The administration has also doomed hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers by shutting off vital assistance. By contrast, Trump has lavished praise on Sheinbaum, calling her “tough” and “a wonderful woman.” Vice President J. D. Vance, who urged military action against Mexico during his service in the Senate, has gone quiet.\n\nOther American allies must be impressed and envious. What’s Sheinbaum’s secret? How is she saving her country from the Trump-Vance flex?\n\nThe answer is straightforward, but not the one that the Palacio Nacional’s social-media operation is trying to project. Contrary to appearances, the Sheinbaum secret is appeasement. The reason Mexico’s president has not been called out for her Trump-complaisance is that the country’s political opposition and independent media are too crushed to name the policy for what it is. But the evidence is in.\n\nDavid Frum: The ‘Gulf of America’ is an admission of defeat\n\nPresident Trump has made six big demands of Mexico. Sheinbaum has granted them all. Let’s proceed, one by one:\n\nHe wants much more active Mexican cooperation on immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border. He wants Mexico to receive people deported from the United States, including people who are not Mexican nationals. He wants Mexico to adopt a more militarized approach to drug interdiction. He wants a new tariff regime to shift more North American manufacturing from Mexico to the United States. He wants Mexico to join U.S. trade actions against China. He wants Mexico to submit politely to this shakedown, and not make too much fuss.\n\nFirst, Mexico has helped Trump seal the border. In February, apprehensions at the border dropped below 9,000 for the month, the lowest level since the 1960s. Meanwhile, the Center for Immigration Studies, an immigration-skeptic group, estimates that U.S. border authorities are catching close to 95 percent of would-be crossers; if so, this means that successful crossings have trickled down to likely the lowest level since the Great Depression.\n\nMexican cooperation has been indispensable to slowing the flow. From Sheinbaum’s entry into office on October 1, 2024, to the end of that year, Mexico detained almost 500,000 migrants en route to the United States. Conditions in Mexican detention centers are notoriously harsh: They are densely crowded, with insufficient food and water and scant toilet facilities; ordinary migrants are mingled with violent gang members. Mexico’s national human-rights commission has difficulty gaining access to such sites. The high likelihood of ending a thousand-mile journey in a Mexican prison exerts a powerful deterrent effect on would-be immigrants. So do the intense military operations on the Mexico-Guatemala border.\n\nDuring the Mexican presidential campaign of 2024, immigrants and their advocates expressed hope for a more permissive attitude from Sheinbaum. Instead, Sheinbaum has aligned Mexican policy with Trump’s edicts.\n\nSheinbaum has also acceded to Trump’s second wish, creating a new program to ease the return of Mexicans deported by the United States. Deportees will be met on arrival, provided with Mexican identity documents, and enrolled in Mexico’s health-care programs. Sheinbaum has indicated willingness to accept non-Mexican deportees and share responsibility for returning them to their home countries, in Central America or elsewhere.\n\nTrump’s third wish—the militarization of drug interdiction—must have been even more difficult for Sheinbaum to grant. For a generation, opposition to a militarized approach to drugs has been a defining issue for the Mexican left, which regarded the country’s deadly drug war as a futile effort to protect Americans from their own country’s social ills. “Hugs, not bullets” was the slogan of Sheinbaum’s predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\n\nAs president, however, Sheinbaum has yielded to American pressure. In February, she delivered 29 cartel figures from Mexican custody to U.S. authorities. Extradition was another historical pain point for the Mexican left, with its implied premise that American justice superseded Mexican sovereignty. Sheinbaum dramatically departed from past Mexican practice to surrender the wanted men. Beyond the symbolism of that surrender, bigger things are happening. Sheinbaum has granted permission for U.S. drone surveillance inside Mexico. CNN has reported that the U.S. is even flying Reapers, UAV systems that can carry a missile. For now, apparently, the Reapers fly unarmed, but the instruments for an American air war against cartels are already in place over Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum has also yielded to U.S. pressure on Trump’s fourth wish: Acquiescence to his tariffs. Unlike Canada, which has countered U.S. tariffs with a retaliatory regime of its own, Mexico has not yet responded in kind, even after Trump’s March 26 tariffs on Mexican auto exports. On Wednesday night, Mexico’s economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, did hint in a social-media post that Mexican forbearance may at last be coming to an end—or it may not, because Mexican reaction to Trump tariffs has been impelled by considerations very different from Canada’s.\n\nAlthough the U.S.-Canada-Mexico relationship is in theory a trilateral one, in practice it’s a pair of bilateral deals: U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico. Canada and Mexico have each often sacrificed free-trade ideals to gain national advantage at the expense of the other U.S. trading partner. In the 2020 trade round, Canada tried to score off Mexico by writing a $16-an-hour minimum wage into the regulation of North American trade in automobiles and auto parts. The Canadian scheme backfired, however, when Mexican manufacturers opted out of the free-trade structure designed to keep wages low, correctly calculating that they could out-compete Canada even without tariff-free access to the U.S. marketplace: In 2020, Mexican auto exports to the United States overtook Canadian exports. Sheinbaum seems willing to stay neutral in the U.S.-Canada trade war in hope of collecting an additional share of the U.S. spoils.\n\nOn wish five, Sheinbaum is again complying. At the end of February, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that Mexico had offered to match U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports. Canada, struggling to preserve the remnants of a global free-trade system, has so far opposed this carve-up of the world into trading blocs.\n\nFinally, Mexico has also granted Trump’s sixth wish. Trump cares enormously about deference to his power. Canadian politicians have retorted to Trump’s demeaning comments, most famously in then–Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s televised March 4 words: “Now, it’s not in my habit to agree with The Wall Street Journal. But, Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.” Trudeau called Trump by his first name and condemned his decision as “dumb.” Trump and his vice president use rhetoric like that all the time, but they intensely resent its being returned upon them.\n\nSheinbaum, by contrast, never mentions Trump by name when she replies to U.S. actions against Mexico, not even with her jibe about “America Mexicana.” She is careful not to contradict him in public, and her tight-mouthed restraint earned compliments from Trump.\n\nDavid Frum: The failing state next door\n\nSheinbaum’s Trump wish fulfillment, especially on immigration, may be good neighborliness that ought to be expected from any Mexican government. But have her methods succeeded in defending Mexico from Trump’s protectionism and aggression? Can they be emulated by others? The answers are “not really,” and “no.”\n\nMexico has not been exempted from Trump’s economic warfare against former partners, culminating in yesterday’s tariff attack on imports of cars, trucks, and auto components. Mexico is accepting an intrusive and growing U.S. military presence in its airspace that may yet trigger open warfare between the United States and Mexican cartels on Mexican soil. Although Mexico has gained auto-manufacturing share at Canada’s expense since the first Trump administration, Mexican hopes of nearshoring industrial capacity at China’s expense have not come to pass and may now be dashed utterly by Trump’s latest moves to reduce or stop international trade. Trump wants any nearshoring to occur in the United States itself, to benefit his voters in red states.\n\nThings could certainly be worse for Mexico than they are. López Obrador bequeathed a great many vulnerabilities to his successor. He left Mexico with its biggest budget deficit since the catastrophic debt crisis of the early 1980s, exposing the country to exactly the kind of international financial pressure he himself so constantly denounced in speeches. But “things could be worse” is a very limited sort of success. Sheinbaum’s strategy seems to be to succeed only in the sense that others are losing even more.\n\nEven if Sheinbaum’s appeasement approach were Mexico’s best option, her model cannot be emulated by other states, especially democratic ones. A prerequisite for her strategy is that she leads a society that is consolidating into a one-party state, with a media subject to ever more stringent restrictions and government control.\n\nA major reason for Trudeau’s snarky comments to Trump is that Canada is confronting the Trump tariffs at a time of intense political competition. In the federal election scheduled for April 28, Conservatives and Liberals are battling to position themselves as the tougher anti-Trump alternative. Sheinbaum can afford to submit to Trump’s coercion because she commands overwhelming majorities in Congress, doesn’t face the next round of congressional elections until 2027, and has put in place mechanisms to manipulate those elections when they finally come.\n\nSheinbaum’s political biography is that of a cadre of the left. But today, the most important political cleft is not the fading distinction between right and left, but the rising conflict between liberal and illiberal, democratic and autocratic. As Mexico follows America into illiberality, Mexico’s leadership finds itself surprisingly favored by Trump’s Washington, along with Russia, Saudi Arabia, and El Salvador. In contrast, the formerly close U.S. ally Canada is consigned to join Ukraine, Denmark, Panama, and the democracies of Europe and East Asia on the Trump enemies list.\n\nSheinbaum’s policy of Trump appeasement may well be the least-bad course open to Mexico. But it should be seen for what it is, not misunderstood as the brave resistance it most definitely is not.",

        "content": "By design, clinical trials ask their participants to take on risk. To develop new vaccines, drugs, or therapies, scientists first have to ask volunteers to try out those interventions, with no guarantee that they’ll work or be free of side effects. To minimize harm, researchers promise to care for and monitor participants through a trial’s end, long enough to collect the data necessary to determine if a therapy is effective and at what cost. End a trial too early, and researchers might not be able to figure out if it worked—or participants may be left worse off than when they started.\n\nBut that is exactly what the Trump administration has been asking scientists across the country to do. Since the end of last month, the administration has forced the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, to terminate hundreds of research awards made to scientists across the country. Among those NIH-funded projects are more than 100 clinical trials that now may be forced to halt abruptly, agency officials told me. And those officials expect further orders to cancel hundreds more. (The NIH officials I spoke with for this story requested anonymity for fear of job loss or other retaliation from the federal government.)\n\nThe Trump administration has been laying siege to science for months—just this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH, announced that it will fire 10,000 people. But the federal government’s disregard for clinical trials is one of the most direct illustrations yet that the nation’s new leaders have abandoned people’s health.\n\nGrinding these trials to a screeching halt is “completely reckless,” Katie M. Edwards, a social-work professor at the University of Michigan, told me. Participants might still need to be tapered off a drug regimen to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal, or monitored for reactions to a device implanted in their body; they might depend on the intervention they’re receiving for their mental or physical health. Edwards herself has had three clinical trials terminated this month, including one testing whether an online mentoring program could reduce rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm among trans teens; halting it, she told me, “could lead to a number of negative outcomes, including increasing suicidality.” The canceled trials also include studies on safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy; increasing use of PReP, the HIV preventative, among people with substance-abuse disorders; probiotics and prebiotics for infants born to mothers living with HIV; and improving adherence to breast-cancer and heart-disease drugs.\n\nIn boilerplate letters, the federal government has told scientists that their science is no longer consistent with agency priorities or a good use of taxpayer funds, and that the agency will no longer fund their work. That’s tantamount to being told to “stop work immediately,” Matthew Spinelli, an infectious-disease physician at UC San Francisco, told me: He received a termination for a study trialing an antibiotic that can prevent sexually transmitted bacterial infections but that also can cause rare but substantial side effects.\n\nAfter The Atlantic reached out to NIH for comment, a spokesperson wrote over email that HHS is altering its funding practices to align with new department priorities, and that “it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans while taking the protection of human participants in our supported clinical research very seriously.”\n\nIn the past, if an NIH-funded clinical trial needed to halt—in an instance of, say, misconduct or clear harm to patients—the agency could be counted on to provide money and support to ensure that the study’s participants wouldn’t take on further risk and that even prematurely ending work remained ethically intact. Now, though, the government is the one causing risks to patients, well beyond what they signed up for.\n\nClinical trials are usually designed with a predetermined end date so that researchers can collect the data they need and make sure participants’ efforts don’t go to waste. Generally speaking, trials are halted midway only if it’s in the participants’ best interest—if, say, the treatment being tested is clearly doing more harm than good. Even then, winding down a clinical trial safely can take months as researchers perform final check-ins with participants, collect additional data on safety, and in some cases help make arrangements for additional clinical care—work that requires time, personnel, and funds. “To stop all of a sudden, with no warning and no grace period? I’ve never seen that,” Domenico Accili, the director of the Columbia University Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center, told me.\n\nThe Trump administration has said that the projects it’s ending are unscientific or not in service of improving the health of Americans. But as I’ve previously reported, its decisions about which grants to cut have been made seemingly without regard to scientific legitimacy, according to even the NIH officials being forced to sign the cancellation letters. The cuts have variously targeted studies on LGBTQ populations, DEI, health equity, and vaccine uptake; projects in foreign countries; grants that happen to have been housed at universities the Trump administration is sanctioning for other reasons; projects that make mention of COVID-19. This blitz has also hit grants less focused on those topics: Projects on antibodies, genetics, and dementia have been cut simply because—as far as scientists and NIH officials can tell—their titles or descriptions mention words such as diversity.\n\nAll of these research grants were awarded on the basis of scientific merit, and to halt them for political reasons is “totally unethical,” Holly Fernandez Lynch, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, told me: “Once you have asked people to undertake the burden and risk of research participation, you don’t get to then just decide, Oh, we don’t want to do it anymore.”\n\nBut that’s the position researchers have been forced into. Without financial resources, they can’t deliver the care and monitoring they promised participants when they enrolled them in their trials—even though they’ve already collected data and personal information. “People are being left in every stage of the research pipeline,” Delivette Castor, an epidemiologist at Columbia, who received a termination for a cervical-cancer-prevention clinical trial, told me. “It is a violation of trust, and all the resources we have put in.”\n\nLauren Obsorne, an ob-gyn at Cornell, told me that she and her colleagues had just started a trial that paired doulas with women on Medicaid, or from racial-minority backgrounds, to test whether an education-focused intervention could reduce postpartum depression and heart problems. After the NIH terminated the study’s grant, the doulas had to call mothers who had given birth days or weeks before to say they could no longer offer help, Osborne told me. Kathleen Sikkema, a clinical psychologist at Columbia, told me she was close to completing her clinical trial, which aimed to improve engagement with HIV care among women in South Africa with a history of sexual trauma, when her termination letter arrived. But halting her work now would mean skipping a final assessment for at least 20 people, to check their viral load and determine their next course of treatment. “That’s terribly needed,” she told me.\n\nMany researchers hit by the NIH’s funding cuts are still trying to figure out ways to safely offboard people from their studies. Some have sought funds from their department or university; some are turning to private donors or pharmaceutical companies, or dipping into money they’ve made as practicing physicians. But those resources are small and spotty. Several researchers told me that, even in a best-case scenario, they likely have just weeks or months of money left. Even now, “I’m hoping at some point I can charge NIH,” Sikkema, who’s working with her university to pool funds for the remainder of her study, told me. But “there isn’t an open federal fund that we can charge,” she added. “It’s not completely clear who’s going to pay for it in the end.”\n\nDuring the NIH’s initial funding freeze, two officials told me, agency officials were told to alert leadership if the halt on payments to certain studies might compromise patient safety, so that exceptions might be considered. And early last month, a subset of clinical trials were among the first studies that NIH leadership said could have their grant funds unfrozen (though many payment halts continued in the weeks after). But on the whole, the NIH’s recent guidance on preserving patient safety has been murky at best, one of the officials said, and added that they were not aware of any exceptions that had ever been made. Another official described the policy on exceptions as “piecemeal permissiveness,” saying that it offered only the guise of safeguarding people in studies. And for grant terminations, scientific staff at NIH have not been allowed to petition for exceptions at all, even if participant safety is clearly on the line, officials told me. “If they are on the list, they are terminated,” one of them said.\n\nA few researchers told me that they had received documents from the NIH saying that they “may request funds to support patient safety and orderly closeout of the project.” None of them, though, was told how exactly they might go about requesting those funds, what the budget might be, what sorts of actions would qualify, or even what counts as “patient safety” or “orderly closeout” under the agency’s new leadership. After the grant terminations began, at least one of the agency’s institutes, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, prepared more specific instructions for researchers on how to navigate closeout procedures, specifying, for instance, that all study participants should be informed of the study’s halt and that “there must be a plan” for any ongoing safety monitoring. But those documents did not accompany the first several rounds of NIH terminations, which began late last month. And although a few researchers told me they were now working with their university to try to seek additional funds from the NIH, they also said they weren’t hopeful that the government would grant their requests—or even honor any payments they did offer.\n\nEven if researchers are able to cobble together the funds to help their participants exit trials safely, halting studies early could still nullify the contributions of the people who enrolled. Studies need a bare-minimum number of data points, and if the target number of participants fails to complete a trial, researchers might not be able to calculate anything about the interventions’ usefulness or safety. Nor can trials easily restart, if the flow of money picks back up. Many studies rely on collecting information at precise, regular intervals; miss just one data point, and an entire analysis can be thrown off. For other studies, skipping a scheduled dose of a drug, or a scheduled check-in with a patient with a progressing condition, can compromise how well an intervention works.\n\nMany of the studies targeted by the Trump administration also focus on populations at higher risk of worse health outcomes, who have been historically neglected by science and medicine; recruiting participants to some of these trials, researchers told me, took years of establishing and maintaining trust, as well as careful partnerships with local leaders. Any betrayals to the commitments researchers made to those people could compromise the ability of scientists to work with them in the future. “Why are people going to be willing to contribute to science and enroll in these studies if they feel like the rug can be pulled out from under them at any time?” Fernandez Lynch told me.\n\nThiago Arzua, a neuroscientist at Columbia, told me that his research has been affected by the NIH’s recent grant cancellations. But Arzua was also enrolled as a participant in an NIH-terminated study that tracked HIV prevention and transmission among sexual and gender minorities. “It’s pretty sad,” he said, to see years of investment from underserved communities go to waste. The message coming from the government has never been clearer, he and others told me. From the start, the Trump administration has flaunted its lack of interest in advancing science or supporting the people who do it. Now its actions are declaring that it also doesn’t care about the people science is trying to help.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "A young woman is at a diner with friends, being stared down by a waitress with frosted lipstick and no time to waste. What she wants is a soda—but for whatever reason, she can’t bring herself to have one. Same with the girl at the pool party, and the one at the drive-through, and the one sitting in what looks like a sorority house, and the guy at the convenience store. Their brows are furrowed, their mouths are pouty, their faces are twisted into ever-more over-the-top expressions of longing and ambivalence. Their friends are getting so annoyed with them. Eventually, the solution to a problem invented within the space of 40 seconds: “Stop spiraling! Get a Poppi!”\n\nI’ve now watched this ad, which ran during this year’s Super Bowl, six times, and I still cannot say I fully understand it. Its premise is that people are somehow tortured, or embarrassed, by the idea of drinking soda—something that the president, Dua Lipa, and millions of Americans do regularly, seemingly without great turmoil. The solution, the ad argues, is Poppi, which is largely indistinguishable from soda, the very thing that was supposedly shameful in the first place: It’s a carbonated, sweetened, canned beverage, available in flavors including root beer, cherry cola, and grape—the type of drink that, despite years of anti-soda rhetoric and Poppi’s vision of collective psychosis, Americans simply cannot quit. In an interview, Neal Baer, a pediatrician who has taught a class called “Soda Politics” at Yale’s School of Public Health, was frank: “It’s old soda in new cans.”\n\nRead: The most miraculous—and overlooked—type of milk\n\nPoppi contains significantly less sugar than standard sodas—five grams, or about a teaspoon, per can, compared with Coke’s 39—as well as stevia, a calorie-free, plant-based sweetener, and inulin, a type of soluble fiber derived, in this case, from agave. This is what allows Poppi to sell itself as a healthier, anxiety-free kind of not-soda soda, and what makes it the perfect beverage for a country that loves talking about how bad soda is almost as much as we love drinking it. In 2024, the company sold more than half a billion dollars’ worth of Poppis. Last week, it was acquired by PepsiCo (notably a soda company) for just under $2 billion.\n\nFor much of the past two decades, soda was—if not the kind of thing you’d hide in the bottom of your recycling bin, as one particularly confusing piece of Poppi marketing copy puts it—suffering a bit of a reputation problem. This is because soda is really not good for you: It generally contains a ton of sugar and no vitamins, and also the bubbles are bad for your teeth. So it was shunned, taxed, and villainized, likened to cigarettes and made a synecdoche for America’s broken food system, in which empty calories are easier and cheaper to obtain than nutritionally dense foods. School districts banned its sale. Television stations ran PSAs against it. The nutritionist Marion Nestle wrote an entire book about it, Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (And Winning).\n\nThe coalition of nutritionists, public-health experts, legislators, and consumer advocates who took on Big Soda did win—to some degree. After climbing steadily starting in the 1960s, sales of full-calorie soda decreased by about 25 percent from 1995 to 2015. But in gross terms, Americans were still consuming a lot of sugary drinks: They may have been turning away from traditional soda, but they were turning toward sweetened coffee and tea, energy drinks, sports drinks, dirty soda, and boba. From 2011 to 2014, roughly half of American adults and 63 percent of American teens were drinking a sugary drink on any given day. By 2017, consumption had plateaued. Last year, both Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper sold more cans of soda than they had the year before.\n\nNow the second-wave sodas have come for us. In November, Walmart announced an entirely new category: “modern soda,” which is distinct from traditional soda and usually more expensive. It includes drinks such as Poppi, as well as its biggest competitor, Olipop, which, like Poppi, comes in spunky, modern-looking cans and a variety of nostalgic and new flavors, and which also contains inulin and less sugar. Coca-Cola, looking to compete, recently started selling its own version of second-wave soda, called Simply Pop.\n\nRead: Starbucks’ most beloved offering is disappearing\n\nThese drinks are, without question, “far healthier than regular, full-sugar sodas,” Caitlin Dow, a senior nutrition scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, told me in an email. They’re also probably better than many diet sodas, which are typically made with possibly carcinogenic sweeteners such as aspartame. But, Baer told me, they’re still what nutritionists call sugar-sweetened beverages. “That is not good for you.”\n\nAnd the science on inulin, Poppi and Olipop’s other big sell, is “pretty meh,” Dow told me: These fibers do increase one specific kind of bacteria in the gut, she wrote, though there’s no strong evidence that doing that “actually translates to better gut health … or any other kind of health. But the evidence is VERY clear that inulin makes people gassy. (Shockingly, companies don’t seem to brag about that finding.)” In May, Poppi settled for nearly $9 million a class-action lawsuit brought by a California woman who objected to the company’s health claims; Poppi did not acknowledge any fault, liability, or wrongdoing. Ultimately, Dow wrote, the claims made by Poppi and the like are “largely a marketing ploy” designed to “separate health-conscious consumers from their money.”\n\nIn this sense, these drinks really are like soda, which is, and always has been, a miracle of marketing. “It’s an amazing story,” Baer told me—a remarkably unhealthy, nutritionally inessential product that costs pennies to make but has nonetheless spawned a billion-dollar industry. Coca-Cola started as a brand-new category of drink with dubious health benefits, spent much of the past century blanketing the world in nonsense advertising slogans such as “Open Happiness,” and is now available in almost every country on Earth. Red Bull threw vitamin B, an amino acid, and some caffeine into soda and told people it would give them energy. Vitaminwater has managed to make liquid sugar sound virtuous. Now Poppi and its ilk have capitalized on ambient concerns about gut health and sugar to sell a new kind of flavored fizzy water, one that signals something about the person drinking it. “It says you’re sophisticated,” Stephen Zagor, who teaches food entrepreneurship at Columbia University, told me: You’re not drinking the same soda as your parents. “It’s this sort of more informed consumer who can read a label,” Andrea Hernández, a trend forecaster who runs a Substack newsletter about packaged foods, told me: “Let’s replace all these things that we like and try to make sure that they’re not killing us.” But, Hernández said, none of this is a real challenge to traditional soda—it’s an endorsement of it: “If it wasn’t for the nostalgia of actual sodas, there would be no Olipop or Poppi.”\n\nUntil last week, I had never tried either—not because I’m ashamed to drink soda, but because I have been so devoted to Diet Coke for so long that anything else makes my tongue feel sweaty and disoriented. I bought a can of wild-berry Poppi at my local corner store for $2.99, which is significantly more than the $1.25 I spend on my usual tallboy of aspartame juice. It was cute and, sure, vaguely reminiscent of wild berries. I’m not sure what else to say: It tasted like soda.",

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nWhere have you gone, Elmo, Cookie Monster, and Big Bird?\n\nIn a more innocent time, the hallowed puppets of Sesame Street were recurring characters in congressional debates about public broadcasting. They served a vital and somewhat quaint Kabuki function: Whenever a politician questioned whether PBS or NPR should continue to receive government funding, public-broadcast advocates predictably trotted out their furry or feathered friends to disarm the bullies and remind everyone how beloved these creatures are. Especially by kids. Remember the kids!\n\nSadly, Messrs. Elmo, Monster, and Bird were nowhere to be seen on Capitol Hill today. They would not have fit in, anyway, as the proceedings in a crowded basement-level hearing room of the Capitol Visitor Center were not sweet, accepting, or the least bit neighborly.\n\nTom Junod: My friend Mr. Rogers\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, had invited the heads of PBS, Paula Kerger, and of NPR, Katherine Maher, to testify before the House Oversight Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE). As chair of the subcommittee, Greene had many questions. And, it would seem, preexisting impressions: The hearing was titled “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable.” (The Atlantic has a partnership with WETA, which receives funding from PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.)\n\nGreene gaveled the proceeding to order at 10 a.m. “Today, we are looking at the more than half a billion dollars federal taxpayers spend annually to fund public radio and television,” she said in her opening statement. She vowed to grill the witnesses about their oversight of “radical left-wing echo chambers,” and accused the CEOs of perpetrating a “communist agenda” and being fine with “sexualizing and grooming children.”\n\nThis seemed hostile.\n\nIt was not really surprising, though. In her brief time in Congress, Greene has proved a relentless voice of MAGA grievance and one-woman Masterpiece Theatre in reacting to the latest outrage visited upon Donald Trump. Her newly created DOGE subcommittee fashions itself as a corollary to the efforts of Elon Musk in his quest to identify and slash or eliminate whatever government work and workers he deems unworthy.\n\nThe panel quickly fell into a familiar pattern of Republicans and Democrats taking turns giving five-minute speeches, nominally framed as questions for the witnesses. Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat, devoted most of his statement to railing against the subcommittee’s priorities. He believed that it should not be using its power to “go after the likes of Elmo and Cookie Monster,” but should be more concerned with getting to the bottom of why high-level officials in the Trump administration texted sensitive national-security material to Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of this magazine (a big story this week, apparently). “If shame was still a thing, this hearing would be shameful,” Lynch said.\n\nJames Comer, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, said that he used to listen to NPR while working on a farm during his rural Kentucky youth. He spoke with a measure of nostalgic fondness for the outlet, until his inevitable pivot. “I don’t even recognize NPR anymore,” lamented Comer, who now dismisses the outlet as “propaganda.”\n\nEven if the Sesame Street characters were not physically present, Democrats were eager to apply the show’s recurring bits to Trump’s conduct in the White House. “To borrow a phrase from Sesame Street, the letter of the day is c—for corruption,” Greg Casar, of Texas, said. “Leave Elmo alone!” he pleaded.\n\nFrom the January/February 2023 issue: Why is Marjorie Taylor Greene like this?\n\nRobert Garcia, a Democrat from California, had pointed questions for Kerger, of PBS. He wanted to know whether Elmo’s ruddy complexion signaled some troubling political sympathies. “Is Elmo now or has he ever been a member of the Communist Party of the United States?” he asked. Garcia also wanted to know if Bert and Ernie had an extremist liberal agenda. He appeared to be kidding.\n\nThe spectacle lasted a few hours and was mostly forgettable. But it illustrated how another entrenched (and somewhat goofy) Washington tradition—wrangling over whether to defund public broadcasting—has devolved into cheap and predictable posturing. Theoretically, it should be possible to hold a perfectly legitimate debate over whether public money should subsidize radio and TV outlets—and to do it without the chair of the subcommittee accusing PBS of being “one of the founders of the trans child-abuse industry.”\n\nAlas, this was not to be today. The hearing room emptied out around lunchtime, and that was it for conducting the nation’s business.\n\nThis article was brought to you by the letter d—for depressing.",

        "content": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nThe Atlantic published more details from a Signal chat between President Donald Trump’s top advisers that included sensitive details about a military strike in Yemen. The group chat, created by National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, included several high-level administration members, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and an account called “TG,” the initials of the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. In screenshots published by The Atlantic, the defense secretary messaged information about strike targets and times of attack. Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the veracity of the chat.\n\nThe report of the security breakdown launched hundreds of memes, and group chats across the country were jokingly renamed “Houthi PC Small Group.” Amid the snickering in Washington, D.C., were also denials—from Gabbard, Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and President Trump—both to reporters and in congressional hearings, that the information in the chat was classified.\n\nWe talk with Shane Harris, a national-security reporter for The Atlantic, about how he would characterize the messages and what kind of reverberations to expect from this breach.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nClaudine Ebeid: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Claudine Ebeid, in for Hanna Rosin. On Monday, The Atlantic reported that our editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to a Signal group chat. It was a thread with senior Trump administration officials that included sensitive military information about an attack on Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nOn the day of the attack, March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared operational details two hours before the strikes. And Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the veracity of the chat.\n\nEarlier this week, Jeff and Atlantic staff writer Shane Harris were on the show. Since then, administration officials have roundly denied there was any classified information in the thread, including in testimony before Congress.\n\nMark Warner: Director Gabbard, you are the security executive and set access guidelines for classified information. Did you contact the defense secretary or others after this specific military planning was put out and say: Hey—we should be doing this in a SCIF? Tulsi Gabbard: There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat. Warner: So then if there [is] no classified material, share it with the committee.\n\nEbeid: With me now is Shane Harris, who covers national security. Hi, Shane.\n\nShane Harris: Hi.\n\nEbeid: So Shane, we just heard Democratic Senator Mark Warner questioning Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. She and other administration officials have reiterated that there was no classified information in the Signal chat.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the administration’s response after the original story was published?\n\nHarris: My reaction was Well, if what we’re looking at in these texts isn’t classified information, then maybe I don’t know what classified information is. (Laughs.) I’ve been doing this a while, and look—I mean, I don’t understand their argument here.\n\nThis information is presumptively classified, and I don’t think you have to take my word for it. You can actually go look at DOD regulations and intelligence regulations that are available online, and there are helpful tables where in one column it will, you know, list the descriptions of kinds of information and then tell you their relevant classification status, where they should be set.\n\nAnd there are all kinds of different categories that are implicated in this text chain—in particular, when we’re talking about things like these strike plans that you just heard Senator Warner ask Director Gabbard about that Secretary Hegseth had shared.\n\nYou know, if you look just at the government’s own guidelines, the kinds of information that are in here are presumptively classified. So I don’t know where the basis for this claim—I could take a stab at why I think politically they’re making it—but as a legal or a sort of security matter, I don’t know what the foundation for that claim is.\n\nEbeid: Since that response, The Atlantic published the text of the Signal chat, including information that was previously left out of Monday’s story. So what can you tell me about making that decision?\n\nHarris: Well, there were two things that were driving that for us. One was that, you know, to our surprise, officials—including, you know, the DNI, the CIA director, the White House spokesperson, and ultimately the president himself—weighed in on this on Tuesday, saying that the information in the thread was unclassified. Which was, you know, kind of just say, Okay, well, then is it not considered sensitive? I mean, can this be shared?\n\nAnd the other thing was that administration officials, including the president, were attacking our journalism. And they were implying or claiming that we were deceiving the public, that if the public saw them, they would see that actually, you know, Jeff and the editors of The Atlantic were lying to them about what they really said.\n\nAnd so I think that we felt an obligation in that way to show people, Look—this is what is in these messages. You can decide for yourself if we’re being honest with you. And by the way, this is everything that the president says is unclassified and his top advisers say is unclassified.\n\nEbeid: And, you know, the idea of what counts as classified information and what doesn’t, who determines what’s classified, and when it’s classified—these are not new questions in your line of work. But for people without your background, can you tell us a little bit more about how we should think about these arguments around what it means for something to be classified?\n\nHarris: So think of it this way: Information is classified. By information, I’m talking about—it could be anything, and the government classifies a lot of things. It’s classified according to the damage that would be done if the information were publicly released. So you have different levels of classification.\n\nYou have “Secret.” Above that, you have “Top Secret.” Above that, you have something called “Top Secret / SCI.” And then even within that level, you have different, what are called, “compartments” of information. That is essentially information that can only be known by those with a need-to-know who are read into a particular compartment, so the really kind of super-secret stuff, you can think of it.\n\nAnd those labels are put on pieces of information to let people in the government who are handling this information know how to handle it, how much to restrict it, who’s allowed to see it. It’s essentially like a coding system that, again, is based on the damage that would be done if it were known outside of these closed circles of people who need to know it.\n\nSo who decides what information is classified? Senior-level government officials often have that authority. Secretaries of defense, of state have what’s called “original classification authority.” Pete Hegseth can mark something classified if he wants to. He can also begin the process to declassify something if he wants to do that.\n\nAnd this really is, I mean, usually something that is done on an agency-by-agency or department-by-department basis. So the Defense Department kind of categorizes all of its classified information. And the CIA does the same for its classified information. And it really, it’s just—I mean, when we talk about something being classified, usually what it really means at base is: It’s sensitive. It’s information that the agency doesn’t want a lot of people to know about or doesn’t want people outside the kind of cleared circle to know about. That’s probably the best way to think about it.\n\nEbeid: And you saw the texts. Based on what you know, is there a category that you would have put those texts? A level of classification?\n\nHarris: I would’ve presumed they were top secret, which is not to say that that’s the most most secret, but I would’ve presumed that they were at least top secret, because you’re talking about information about a military attack that’s about to happen.\n\nYou know, Hegseth is sharing things like the time that F-18s are going to launch, when they will be releasing their weapons, what the follow-on attacks will be, by what kind of aircraft, by what kind of weapons. This is sensitive information because if this fell into the hands of an adversary, the adversary is going to know how to try to avoid the attack or potentially launch a counterattack, which then, that could also jeopardize the lives of U.S. forces, who are already, you know, flying into harm’s way because the Houthis have antiaircraft capabilities. They can try to shoot these planes down, and we know that.\n\nSo why would you want information like this to be in an unsecured channel, where it could fall into the hands of somebody who could, you know, give it to your adversary? And obviously, that didn’t happen here, but this case kind of exemplifies why they shouldn’t be using Signal to begin with. If they’d been having these conversations on a secure government system, it would be impossible to have added Jeffrey Goldberg to that chat.\n\nSo this is why Signal is not well suited for sharing this kind of information. Talking about things in a more broad sense or unclassified or not highly sensitive information? Sure. And lots of officials do that. And there are instances in which that is fine and condoned, but I have yet to find anybody who can tell me that this kind of information is fine to share in Signal.\n\nI just—I think it’s not. And if these officials have made a determination that it is, I think they owe the public an explanation for that. Instead, what they’ve done is insist it’s unclassified, which implies it’s not terribly sensitive, and they’ve attacked us for reporting about it.\n\nEbeid: So this isn’t the first time we’ve had a scandal around sensitive information. We’ve, of course, you know, had the Hillary Clinton email saga. There’s that Donald Trump was indicted over classified documents in Florida before the case was dropped after his election. Could you put this breach in the context of those past episodes?\n\nHarris: Yeah. I think if you take the Hillary Clinton email server kind of at one end of severity, which is to say kind of a lower end—it’s not insignificant; I want to emphasize that—and then you put the Donald Trump taking classified documents to Mar-a-Lago, for which he’s indicted, at the high end of severity, because here we’re talking about boxes of paper classified documents in an unsecured place, lots of people milling about, I think that this Signal chat falls somewhere in the middle of that. And maybe closer to the Hillary Clinton email side.\n\nAnd the reason I say that is because, look: If Jeff had not been in the room, it’s possible that these would’ve been the only people who knew about it. So that’s to some degree, as in to say, these officials—who are all clear to have this information, by the way—there’s no question that they’re allowed to see what was in the room.\n\nIt’s a question of the way it was transmitted, and the risk that goes with that. There is the obvious risk that, you know, someone could be in the room that wasn’t supposed to be there. But there’s another risk that we haven’t talked about, which is that the devices themselves, the phones on which Signal is running for these 17 or so officials, could those phones have been compromised by a foreign government or by a criminal government?\n\nEbeid: Right. Could they be hacked?\n\nHarris: Could they be hacked? Exactly. And if they were hacked, that means somebody could theoretically be reading the messages as if they were standing there holding the phone themselves.\n\nAnd this is not theoretical. The government, just in recent days, has put out guidance to people who are using Signal, including officials who are using it, warning them about the vulnerabilities that Signal has to foreign-intelligence services. And there are questions about, was Signal running on these officials’ government phones, which we would hope have a pretty high degree of security, or their personal phones, which are under their personal recognizance that might not be as secure as a government phone? So that, I think, tilts it a little more towards the severe side, but I think it’s in the middle of those two scandals.\n\nEbeid: What consequences do you expect for the officials who are on the group chat? Actually, maybe I should ask, given your years of experience, how would you typically expect an administration to respond to this kind of situation?\n\nHarris: The typical response to this would be—I think it’d be twofold.\n\nOne, I think the officials would be humiliated. They’d be highly embarrassed, and if they were thinking about their reputations would probably try to come out and maybe try and do something to soften the blow, but essentially take responsibility for it. I would expect in any other administration, the national security adviser probably would’ve offered the president his resignation, and the president might have taken it.\n\nThe other thing that would happen here is that there would be an investigation, and probably the FBI would do that investigation. The reason for that is: Although this is a very novel example of a classified leak—putting aside that the government says it’s not classified—it’s still a leak. It’s still a leak, and when there is sensitive information that falls into the hands of people who aren’t supposed to have it, the FBI usually investigates that, particularly if—you know, it’s publicly known in this case. But the agencies in question whose information was implicated, what they would normally do is refer that to the FBI and say: We’d like you to investigate this and find out how it happened.\n\nAnd then, of course, part of that investigation would be to determine whether or not there are criminal charges that should be filed. I don’t think that’s likely to happen in this case. I don’t think it’d be likely to happen, by the way, in another administration. The law—this is a strange case. I don’t imagine anyone would be prosecuted, but they’re certainly not gonna be prosecuted in the Trump administration.\n\nEbeid: There is a lawsuit now filed against administration officials for, you know, violating federal recordkeeping laws. Do you think something could come of that?\n\nHarris: Now, that’s possible. I mean, there’s a question of standing. You know, does the plaintiff have standing to bring it? But it’s a really good point. It’s worth just dwelling on a second. There are two records laws that are implicated here: the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act.\n\nAnd in a nutshell, what they require is that if people are going to use a text-messaging service—or any electronic service, for that matter—that’s not an official one, that’s not, like, a .gov service, they’ve gotta make a backup of those communications if they are pertaining to official matters. CIA Director John Ratcliffe actually was testifying earlier this week and mentioned this very fact as a way of defending the CIA’s use of Signal—or what he characterized as the CIA’s use of Signal—which he portrayed as widespread.\n\nI’m not really sure that’s true, but he accurately said that you have to keep a record of these messages if you’re sending them. So there might be some legs to a lawsuit that alleges these officials were violating those records laws.\n\n[Music]\n\nEbeid: More with Shane Harris after the break.\n\n\n\n[Break]\n\nEbeid: You know, Shane, I think I’ve received more text messages—and I should say, messages in Signal—about this story than anything in a very long time.\n\nHarris: Do people want to make a “Houthi PC small group” chat room too?\n\nEbeid: Oh man, let me tell you, all my groups have been renamed this week. But I can’t imagine what kind of responses you’re getting. What are you hearing from people in the intelligence community?\n\nHarris: I think people—what I’m hearing is a mix of people being appalled, outraged, a lot of, If I had done this, I’d be fired. If I had done this, I would be investigated and indicted. There’s a real sense of anger, I think, at what people see as the hypocrisy of these officials and sort of having a “fine for me and not for thee” attitude when it comes to what is ultimately just a really reckless use of technology. I really don’t think there’s any way around that. And I think a real sense, too, among people, including people who don’t work in the government, who I’ve talked to—a real feeling that nothing will happen as a result of this and that no one will be held accountable and that that’s a real shame.\n\nEbeid: And you know, obviously, like, we’re focusing on this one text conversation that happened to include Jeffrey Goldberg. I mean, would it be reasonable for us to assume that this is not the first and only conversation that’s happening like this in Signal or other group-chat environments?\n\nHarris: I think that’s reasonable, and I presume it’s not the only one. And the reason I do is because in this whole conversation that we’re watching them have, not one person says: Hey—should we be doing this on Signal? Why did you add him to this group? Wait, why are we doing this on a text thread?\n\nEveryone behaves as if this is perfectly normal. And to my knowledge, at least in previous administrations, it is not normal. That suggests, to me, that these people have either done this before or know people have done it before.\n\nEbeid: We have been very, you know, in the last couple of days around this story and even in this conversation, we’re very focused on what this means internally in the United States for us. A couple of weeks ago, you were on the show, talking with our host, Hanna Rosin, about this administration’s about-face from European allies and what kind of effect that has on the intelligence community and sharing of information between the U.S. and countries that we’ve traditionally thought of as allies. What kind of fallout could we see with intelligence sharing with other countries after something like this?\n\nHarris: I think this is likely to confirm for our allies that they were right to be skeptical about this administration’s ability to properly handle sensitive information, and that they will start pulling back accordingly.\n\nI think they already have been. And look—in the two days since this story has broken, I’ve had a chance to talk to officials in some allied countries. They’re appalled. They can’t believe this is happening, and they are very candid in saying, you know, This is essentially why we have to rethink whether we can trust this administration.\n\nAnd you know, what’s also so striking to me in some of these conversations is: As aghast as they are, they’re not actually surprised. It’s not that they can’t believe that anyone would do this. It’s more that they think that if anyone were going to do it, it would be people in this administration.\n\nBecause there’s a track record. There has been since the inauguration, and there’s a track record in Trump’s first term. So you know, people are also—you know, like all of us, they’re kind of laughing. I mean, it’s just—there’s a deep comic thread to this story. (Laughs.) No doubt.\n\nEbeid: So many memes.\n\nHarris: So many memes. The memes have been amazing. It’s been one of the best parts. But they’re also taking it really seriously because now they have an actual example, proof that there is information being bandied about in this way. And, you know, I was talking to someone just recently, you know, who said, So are we to assume that you’re gonna take the intelligence that we give you from our country, and you’re also gonna be sharing it with people over Signal? Because that’s not okay.\n\nEbeid: Right. Okay. So that’s the situation with historic allies. What about America’s adversaries? What kind of conversations do you think are happening right now in North Korea and China?\n\nHarris: I think, you know, again, aside from the comedy of it, look: We have these individuals—particularly, the very senior members of the administration, the DNI, the CIA director, the secretary of defense, and to include their senior aides—already are presumably at the top of the target list for foreign intelligence services to try and get information on them, compromise their electronic devices.\n\nWhat I’m afraid this episode will show to those foreign spy agencies is that work of spying on our officials might be easier than they had thought it would be. And I don’t think we should presume for a minute that all of the phones that were used in this Signal chain are a hundred percent secure.\n\nI’m not saying I know them not to be, but I would not presume that they are. I think that there is kind of a pattern of sloppy behavior by senior members of the administration with how they take briefings, with people they have around them, and whether those people have been appropriately cleared, the kinds of communication systems that they’re using.\n\nI don’t think we should view this Signal group as a one-off. I think that this is illustrative of a pattern of behavior and practice that we have seen since President Trump took office, in January. You know, and we’ve talked before and I’ve written before about, you know, the counterintelligence and security risks that happen or get created when people from the DOGE service start barging into agencies and mucking about in computer systems that they don’t really understand, and the way that they can expose information or make it more vulnerable.\n\nSo I think about that and other threads that I’m kind of pulling on and say: The way to think about the “Houthi PC small group” Signal scandal is as part of a whole pattern of behavior, not as something that happened in isolation.\n\nEbeid: Shane, thanks so much for joining me today.\n\nHarris: Thank you for having me, Claudine.\n\n[Music]\n\nEbeid: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Jinae West and edited by Kevin Townsend.

        "title": "Canada’s Military Has a Trump Problem",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Canadians have a grudging commitment to their national defense. The country spends well under 2 percent of its GDP on the military. Its fleets are aging, and much of its infrastructure is crumbling. The Canadian Armed Forces are budgeted for 101,500 personnel—a modest figure compared with allies—and they’re 16,500 short. After years of neglect, the government has slowly started to refurbish the CAF, but it has a long way to go.\n\nIf there’s one reason Canada’s military is this weak, it’s the United States. Sharing a border with a benign superpower has given Canada a source of security and deterrence that it didn’t need to buy or build itself. That’s why the country has designed its military not as a self-sufficient force but largely as a supplement to America’s. The CAF can’t mount sustained overseas operations on its own, but Canada can meaningfully contribute to U.S.-led missions on a limited budget. Domestic manufacturers can’t supply much of the CAF’s most important equipment, but America’s can.\n\nVirtually every aspect of Canada’s military—its size, structure, budget, and strategy—is predicated on a series of assumptions about the benevolence and support of American leaders. These assumptions have been in place for decades; President Donald Trump has overturned them in a matter of weeks. Because of his threats of economic coercion and annexation, Canada’s leaders have suddenly realized they may not be able to rely on American might anymore. Divesting from U.S. suppliers was once unthinkable, but Canada has already begun searching elsewhere. To take just one example, Ottawa is reviewing its $13 billion commitment to buy 88 F-35 fighter aircraft from Lockheed Martin as it hunts for alternative suppliers in Europe. Trump’s threats might compel the CAF to begin decoupling from America—a process that could leave the military even weaker than it is now.\n\nEliot A. Cohen: Invading Canada is not advisable\n\nThis sudden conflict with the United States fundamentally threatens Canada’s long-standing approach to national defense. But Canadians have responded to crises in the past by dramatically bolstering their military on short notice. Trump may have just prompted them to do it again.\n\nOver the past century, Canada has proved that it can mobilize quickly in response to emergencies, despite skimping on defense spending during peacetime. It sent more than 600,000 soldiers to fight in World War I, a considerable effort for a country that had only 3,000 permanent service members and roughly 70,000 militia members leading up to the conflict. Canada demobilized after the armistice, but rapidly rebuilt itself again during World War II. By 1945, the country had the fourth-largest navy in the world.\n\nMembers of the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II (FPG / Hulton Archive / Getty)\n\nAfter fighting in the Korean War, Canada maintained a military sizable enough to station permanent forces in Western Europe and undertake a series of UN peacekeeping missions. But Canada’s defence spending as a percentage of its GDP began a slow decline in 1957. Notably, that was the same year that the Canadian and American governments agreed to establish the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which still provides a binational defense of the continent. Although Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau started modernizing the military in the 1970s, Canada’s willingness to spend on defense was waning.\n\nThis became evident in the 1990s, when the seeds of Canada’s current predicament were planted. As the Cold War ended, Canada’s finances were a mess. To help balance its budget and pay off the growing national debt, Ottawa cut defense spending by approximately 30 percent in the middle of the decade. The reductions not only eliminated crucial funding but also drove away personnel and burned out many who remained. The defense budget increased while Canada contributed to the war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014, but spending never got near 2 percent of GDP.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office, in 2015, he launched the first comprehensive modernization of the military since his father had four decades earlier. Unlike many of his predecessors, Trudeau was willing to incur budget deficits to refurbish the CAF. But his purpose was never to develop an autonomous fighting force. And despite his spending increases, Canada continued to lag behind other NATO members. (Last year, to the exasperation of many allies, Trudeau pledged to reach the alliance’s 2 percent spending target no sooner than 2032.)\n\nTo compensate, the Canadian armed forces have grown even closer to their American counterparts over the past decade. Canada adopted a “plug and play” model, tailoring its armed forces for operations that Americans led. It became steadily more dependent on U.S. logistical support and defense manufacturing.\n\nTrump’s return to office, however, has fundamentally changed Canada’s relationship to both America’s military and its own. The country is in the midst of a federal election, one in which defense features prominently. Both major parties—the Liberals, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, and the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre—are promising to build a stronger Canada and more capable armed forces.\n\nFor both parties to commit to increased defense spending during peacetime is a rarity in Canadian politics, to put it lightly. Canadians may be miserly about defense, but their military resolve in emergencies shouldn’t be underestimated. And they have little doubt that today is an emergency.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic, Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.\n\nKami West had been dating her current boyfriend for a few weeks when she told him that he was outranked by her best friend. West knew her boyfriend had caught snatches of her daily calls with Kate Tillotson, which she often placed on speaker mode. But she figured that he, like the men she’d dated before, didn’t quite grasp the nature of their friendship. West explained to him, “I need you to know that she’s not going anywhere. She is my No. 1.” Tillotson was there before him, and, West told him, “she will be there after you. And if you think at any point that this isn’t going to be my No. 1, you’re wrong.”\n\nIf West’s comments sound blunt, it’s because she was determined not to repeat a distressing experience from her mid-20s. Her boyfriend at that time had sensed that he wasn’t her top priority. In what West saw as an attempt to keep her away from her friend, he disparaged Tillotson, calling her a slut and a bad influence. After the relationship ended, West, 31, vowed to never let another man strain her friendship. She decided that any future romantic partners would have to adapt to her friendship with Tillotson, rather than the other way around.\n\nWest and Tillotson know what convention dictates. “Our boyfriends, our significant others, and our husbands are supposed to be No. 1,” West told me. “Our worlds are backward.”\n\nIn the past few decades, Americans have broadened their image of what constitutes a legitimate romantic relationship: Courthouses now issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Americans are getting married later in life than ever before, and more and more young adults are opting to share a home rather than a marriage license with a partner. Despite these transformations, what hasn’t shifted much is the expectation that a monogamous romantic relationship is the planet around which all other relationships should orbit.\n\nRead: The Friendship Files: Friendly conversations with friends about friendship\n\nBy placing a friendship at the center of their lives, people such as West and Tillotson unsettle this norm. Friends of their kind sweep into territory typically reserved for romantic partners: They live in houses they purchased together, raise each other’s children, use joint credit cards, and hold medical and legal powers of attorney for each other. These friendships have many of the trappings of romantic relationships, minus the sex.\n\nDespite these friendships’ intense devotion, there’s no clear category for them. The seemingly obvious one, “best friend,” strikes many of these committed pairs as a diminishment. Adrift in this conceptual gulf, people reach for analogies. Some liken themselves to siblings, others to romantic partners, “in the soul-inspiring way that someone being thoughtful about loving you and showing up for you is romantic,” as the Rutgers University professor Brittney Cooper describes some of her friendships in her book Eloquent Rage.\n\nSome alternate between the two comparisons. From the night Joe Rivera and John Carroll met at a gay bar in Austin, Texas—Rivera was the emcee for a strip competition, and Carroll won the $250 cash prize—they felt like brothers. “Brothers that really want to hang out and be around each other,” Carroll clarified. Yet when Carroll considered their shared domestic life, he told me that “we have a little married-couple thing going on even though we’re not married.” These mixed analogies suggest that neither wedlock nor siblinghood adequately captures what these friendships feel like.\n\nMany of those who place a friendship at the center of their life find that their most significant relationship is incomprehensible to others.\n\nIntimate friendships don’t come with shared social scripts that lay out what they should look like or how they should progress. These partnerships are custom-designed by their members. Mia Pulido, a 20-year-old student at Drew University, says that she and her “soul mate,” Sylvia Sochacki, 20, have cobbled together role models in what has felt like a “Frankenstein” process: Through reading about intimate female friendships from centuries ago, the pair discovered a framework for a relationship that doesn’t neatly fit the contemporary labels of romantic or platonic. They found their complementary personalities reflected in the characters Sherlock and Watson, and they embraced the casual affection (and the terms of endearment “Bubble” and “Spoo”) that they came across in a note between a wife and husband; it was tucked into a used book they found at a garage sale. Pulido has found it freeing to build a relationship around the needs and desires of Sochacki and herself, rather than “having to work through this mire of what society has told you this relationship consists of.”\n\nMany of those who place a friendship at the center of their life find that their most significant relationship is incomprehensible to others. But these friendships can be models for how we as a society might expand our conceptions of intimacy and care.\n\nWhen Tillotson and West met as 18-year-olds, they didn’t set out to transgress relationship norms. They were on a mission to conform, aye ma’am-ing their way through Marine Corps boot camp in South Carolina, and referring to each other by their last name preceded by the title “Recruit.” Most evenings, Recruit Tillotson and Recruit West spent their hour of free time chatting in front of their shared bunk bed.\n\nDuring these conversations, they discovered that West’s mom had just moved to a city that was a 20-minute ride away from Tillotson’s hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma. West and Tillotson spent boot camp’s month-long break together, winding through the Tulsa suburbs in West’s mother’s black sedan, late-aughts rap pulsing through the rolled-down windows. For most of the next four years, they were stationed thousands of miles apart, including when Tillotson eventually deployed to Iraq. From afar, they coached each other through injuries, work woes, and relationship problems. Their friendship really blossomed once they both ended up in the Tulsa area for college, and they started to spend nearly every day together. By then, Tillotson was waiting for her divorce paperwork to be notarized, and West was a single mother caring for her 3-year-old, Kody.\n\nRead: How friendships change in adulthood\n\nWhen West got a job at a bar, Tillotson watched Kody during the day so her friend could sleep. Tillotson frequently joined West at preschool pickup. When the two women would walk down the hallway, past the miniature lockers, West said, “it was like the seas parted.” Tillotson could feel the parents’ eyes on her. Periodically, a teacher would sidle up to the two women, direct her gaze toward Tillotson, and ask, “Who is this?” “People would always ask us how we know each other, or, ‘Are you sisters?’ A lot of times people think we’re dating,” Tillotson, 31, said. It would take too long for West and Tillotson to explain the complexity and depth of their friendship to every curious questioner.\n\nKirn Vintage Stock / Getty / Arsh Raziuddin / The Atlantic\n\nWith no lexicon to default to, people with friendships like West and Tillotson’s have assembled a collage of relationship language. They use terms such as best soul friend, platonic life partner, my person, ride or die, queerplatonic partner, Big Friendship. For some, these names serve a similar purpose as matching friendship necklaces—they’re tokens mainly meant for the two people within the friendship. Others, such as West and Tillotson, search for language that can make their relationship lucid to outsiders. West and Tillotson realized that people understand boot camp to be an intense setting, the kind of environment that could breed an equally intense friendship. When the friends began to refer to each other as “boot-camp besties,” people’s confusion finally faded.\n\nFor more than a decade, Nicole Sonderman didn’t mind if the only people who understood her friendship with Rachel Hebner were the two women who were part of it. Sonderman sums up their relationship as “having a life partner, and you just don’t want to kiss them.”\n\nIn the years when they both lived in Fairbanks, Alaska, the friends were fluent in the language of each other’s moods and physical changes. Before Hebner suspected that she might be pregnant, Sonderman made her buy a pregnancy test, steered her into the bathroom, and sat in the adjacent stall as Hebner took it. Four years later, the roles reversed: Hebner had the same accurate premonition about Sonderman. “We paid more attention to each other than we did to ourselves,” Sonderman, 37, told me.\n\nRead: What you lose when you gain a spouse\n\nThey occasionally navigated around other people’s confusion about or combativeness toward their friendship. Their preferred term of endearment for each other, wife, wasn’t a problem for Sonderman’s then-husband. But once Hebner divorced her husband and started dating, her romantic partners got jealous, especially the women she dated. Sonderman grudgingly placated them by calling Hebner “wiffles” instead of wife.\n\nAfter those years in Alaska, the pair spent a few years several time zones apart, as Sonderman and her then-husband moved around for his work. Eventually Sonderman moved back to Alaska, but Hebner had relocated to Indiana. Phone calls and occasional visits became their friendship’s support beams. Sonderman said that Hebner reached out less and less as she grappled with a cascade of difficulties: She was in an abusive romantic relationship and she lost her job because she had no one else to take care of her daughter while she worked. She was depressed. In October 2018, Hebner died by suicide.\n\nFor Sonderman, Hebner’s death was devastating. The women had envisioned one day living near each other in Alaska, where the two of them had met, and where Hebner longed to return. Now Sonderman had none of that to look forward to. For six months after Hebner’s death, she kept earphones in when she went to the grocery store. She couldn’t bear small talk.\n\nSonderman found it hard to translate her grief to others. “Most people don’t understand. They’ll just be like, ‘Oh yeah, I had a friend from high school who died’ or something and try to relate. But it doesn’t really resonate with me.” In other cases, people would impose a salacious and inaccurate story line onto their relationship to try to make sense of it. Because Hebner was bisexual, Sonderman said, some people believed that they were secretly lovers, and that Sonderman was closeted.\n\nTo Elizabeth Brake, a philosophy professor at Rice University whose research focuses on marriage, love, and sex, Sonderman’s experience is not just tragic but unjust. Because friendship is outside the realm of legal protection, the law perpetuates the norm that friendships are less valuable than romantic relationships. This norm, in turn, undermines any argument that committed friendships deserve legal recognition. But if, for example, the law extended bereavement or family leave to friends, Brake believes we’d have different social expectations around mourning. People might have understood that, for Sonderman, losing Hebner was tantamount to losing a spouse.\n\nWith no legal benefits or social norms working in her favor, Sonderman has felt most understood by other people who’ve had an intimate friendship. Sonderman described one such friend who was an especially attentive listener. For two hours, he and Sonderman sat in a car, engine off, in a grocery-store parking lot. She talked with him about Hebner, cried about Hebner. Her friend said, “It sounds like she broke your heart.” Sonderman told me, “That was the first time that anybody really got it.”\n\nIntimate friendships have not always generated confusion and judgment. The period spanning the 18th to early 20th centuries was the heyday of passionate, devoted same-sex friendships, called “romantic friendships.” Without self-consciousness, American and European women addressed effusive letters to “my love” or “my queen.” Women circulated friendship albums and filled their pages with affectionate verse. In Amy Matilda Cassey’s friendship album, the abolitionist Margaretta Forten inscribed an excerpt of a poem that concludes with the lines “Fair friendship binds the whole celestial frame / For love in Heaven and Friendship are the same.” Authors devised literary plot lines around the adventures and trials of romantic friends. In the 1897 novel Diana Victrix, the character Enid rejects a man’s proposal because her female friend already occupies the space in her life that her suitor covets. In words prefiguring Kami West’s, Enid tells the man that if they married, “you would have to come first. And you could not, for she is first.”\n\nTwo well-known women who put each other, rather than a husband, first were the social reformer Jane Addams and the philanthropist Mary Rozet Smith. In Addams’s bedroom, now an exhibit at the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, in Chicago, an enormous portrait of Smith hangs above the mantle. After meeting in 1890 at the pioneering settlement house that Addams co-founded, the women spent the next 40 years entwined, trudging through moments they spent apart. During one separation, Addams wrote to Smith, “You must know, dear, how I long for you all the time, and especially during the last three weeks. There is reason in the habit of married folks keeping together.” When Addams traveled without Smith, she would sometimes haul the painting with her. When the two women journeyed together, Addams wired ahead to request a double bed. No scandal erupted in the newspaper. These women weren’t pressed, directly or implicitly, about their sex lives, nor did they feel compelled to invent a label to make sense of their relationship to onlookers, as West and Tillotson would about a century later. Same-sex intimacy like theirs was condoned.\n\nThese friendships weren’t the exclusive province of women. Daniel Webster, who would go on to become secretary of state in the mid-1800s, described his closest friend as “the friend of my heart, the partner of my joys, griefs, and affections, the only participator of my most secret thoughts.” When the two men left Dartmouth College to practice law in different towns, Webster had trouble adjusting to the distance. He wrote that he felt like “the dove that has lost its mate.” Frederick Douglass, the eminent abolitionist and intellectual, details his deep love for his friends in his autobiography. Douglass writes that when he contemplated his escape from slavery, “the thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which I had to contend. The love of them was my tender point, and shook my decision more than all things else.”\n\nOne question these friendships raise for people today is: Did they have sex? Writings from this time, even those about romantic relationships, typically lack descriptions of sexual encounters. Perhaps some people used romantic friendship as a cover for an erotic bond. Some scholars in fact suspect that certain pairs had sex, but in most cases, historians—whose research on the topic is largely confined to white, middle-class friends—can’t make definitive claims about what transpired in these friends’ bedrooms. Though we will never know the exact nature of every relationship, it’s clear that this period’s considerably different norms around intimacy allowed for possibilities in friendship that are unusual today.\n\nA blend of social and economic conditions made these committed same-sex friendships acceptable. Men and women of the 19th century operated in distinct social spheres, so it’s hardly shocking that people would form deep attachments to friends of their own gender. In fact, women contemplating marriage often fretted about forging a life with a member of what many deemed the “grosser sex.”\n\n“You would have to come first. And you could not, for she is first.”\n\nBeliefs about sexual behavior also played a role. The historian Richard Godbeer notes that Americans at the time did not assume—as they do now—that “people who are in love with one another must want to have sex.” Many scholars argue that the now-familiar categories of heterosexuality and homosexuality, which consider sexual attraction to be part of a person’s identity, didn’t exist before the turn of the 20th century. While sexual acts between people of the same gender were condemned, passion and affection between people of the same gender were not. The author E. Anthony Rotundo argues that, in some ways, attitudes about love and sex, left men “freer to express their feelings than they would have been in the 20th century.” Men’s liberty to be physically demonstrative surfaces in photos of friends and in their writings. Describing one apparently ordinary night with his dear friend, the young engineer James Blake wrote, “We retired early and in each others arms,” and fell “peacefully to sleep.”\n\nPhysical intimacy among women also didn’t tend to be read as erotic. Even men wrote approvingly of women’s affectionate relationships, in part because they believed that these friendships served as training grounds for wifehood. In his 1849 novel, Kavanagh, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow casts a friendship between two female characters as “a rehearsal in girlhood of the great drama of a woman’s life”—the great drama, naturally, being marriage to a man.\n\nMen could feel unthreatened by these friendships because few women were in the financial position to eschew the economic support of a husband in favor of a female companion. By the late 1800s, exceptions to this rule started to sprout. Colleges and professions were opening up to middle-class (and, almost exclusively, white) women, enabling these graduates to support themselves, no husband required. At this point, the historian Lillian Faderman told me, women’s intimate friendships “no longer had to be a rehearsal in girlhood.” Educated women could instead live together in what were called Boston marriages. These committed relationships allowed women to pursue careers and evade heterosexual marriage.\n\nFrom the late 1800s to the 1920s, each one of these components—gender-segregated society, women’s economic dependency, the distinction between sexual behavior and identity—was pulled like a Jenga brick from the tower of romantic friendship. Men and women’s divergent social spheres began to look more like a Venn diagram, enabling emotional intimacy between the genders. With far more women in the workforce and potentially independent, men weren’t so enchanted by women’s intimate relationships. Sexologists declared same-sex desire—not merely same-sex sexual acts—perverse. Americans came to fear that kissing or sharing a bed with a friend of the same gender was a mark of “sexual inversion.” Romantic friendships had lost their innocence.\n\nA few decades after the erosion of romantic friendship began, Americans’ conception of marriage shifted. The Northwestern University psychologist Eli Finkel identifies three distinct eras in American marriages. The first, running from the colonial period until about 1850, had a pragmatic focus on fulfilling spouses’ economic and survival needs; the second, lasting until about 1965, emphasized love. Finkel makes the case that starting around 1965, the “self-expressive marriage” became the ideal; spouses expected their partnership to be the site of self-discovery and personal growth. (Excluded from these structures for most of the nation’s existence were the tremendous number of Americans who were denied access to legal marriage, namely enslaved Black Americans, interracial couples, and same-sex couples.) Throughout this evolution, Americans started relying more and more on their spouses for social and emotional support, with friendships consigned to a secondary role.\n\nJohn Carroll, who met his platonic partner, Joe Rivera, at a gay bar, describes this type of romantic relationship as “one-stop shopping.” People expect to pile emotional support, sexual satisfaction, shared hobbies, intellectual stimulation, and harmonious co-parenting all into the same cart. Carroll, 52, thinks this is an impossible ask; experts share his concern. “When we channel all our intimate needs into one person,” the psychotherapist Esther Perel writes, “we actually stand to make the relationship more vulnerable.” Such totalizing expectations for romantic relationships leave us with no shock absorber if a partner falls short in even one area. These expectations also stifle our imagination for how other people might fill essential roles such as cohabitant, caregiver, or confidant.\n\nCarroll and Rivera, 59, escaped this confined thinking. They built their lives around their friendship—at times deliberately, at times improvising in the face of unanticipated events. In 2007, Carroll discovered that the house next door to his was up for sale. He called Rivera with an entreaty: “Bitch, buy that house, and you can just walk home from dinner!” Rivera would no longer have to drive across Austin several times a week to have dinner at Carroll’s house. Carroll, who’s a real-estate agent, had already filled out the contract for the house for his friend. Rivera just needed to sign.\n\nAfter buying the house, Rivera did in fact log fewer miles in traffic, but that was a trivial benefit compared with the life-altering ones that came later. When Rivera became concerned that Carroll’s drug and alcohol use had gotten out of hand, he took photos of partiers entering and leaving Carroll’s house at 3 or 4 a.m. Rivera staged an intervention with Carroll’s other friends, and Carroll agreed to get help before Rivera could even begin reading aloud the two-page letter he’d written. The next day, Rivera drove Carroll to a recovery center, and cried as he filled out the paperwork. Rivera asked the man who ran the center, “What if [Carroll] goes through recovery and when he comes out, he hates me for doing this to him?”\n\nTheir friendship did change after Carroll finished the program, but not as Rivera had feared. While Carroll was in recovery, he and his friends came up with a plan to turn his house into a sober home for gay men—a solution to Carroll’s shaky finances that also served a meaningful purpose. Once Carroll finished his own stint in a sober home, Rivera suggested that Carroll move in with him. By the time Carroll unloaded his bags, Rivera was already months into his own sobriety, a commitment he made even though he never had an alcohol problem. Rivera said, “I didn’t want to be drinking a glass of wine in front of John when he couldn’t have one.” “Who does that?” Carroll asked, his voice blending incredulity and gratitude. They’ve both been sober for a decade.\n\nCompanionate romantic relationships and committed friendships appear to be varieties of the same crop, rather than altogether different species.\n\nA friendship like theirs, which has spanned nearly their entire adulthood and functioned as the nucleus of their support system, raises a fundamental question about how we recognize relationships: On what basis do we decide that a partnership is “real”? It’s a question the journalist Rebecca Traister poses in her book All the Single Ladies, when she examines the central role that friends often play in single women’s lives. “Do two people have to have regular sexual contact and be driven by physical desire in order to rate as a couple? Must they bring each other regular mutual sexual satisfaction? Are they faithful to each other?” she writes. “By those measures, many heterosexual marriages wouldn’t qualify.” At the same time, people who have intimate friendships are eager to declare their devotion. The social theorist bell hooks writes that women who have such close friendships “want these bonds to be honored cherished commitments, to bind us as deeply as marriage vows.” Companionate romantic relationships and committed friendships appear to be varieties of the same crop, rather than altogether different species.\n\nBrake, the philosopher, takes issue not just with cultural norms that elevate romantic relationships above platonic ones, but also with the special status that governments confer on romantic relationships. Whereas access to marriage currently hinges on (assumed) sexual activity, Brake argues that caregiving, which she says is “absolutely crucial to our survival,” is a more sensible basis for legal recognition. She proposes that states limit the rights of marriage to only the benefits that support caregiving, such as special immigration eligibility and hospital visitation rights. Because sexual attraction is irrelevant to Brake’s marriage model, friends would be eligible.\n\nIn LGBTQ circles, placing a high value on friendship has long been common. Carroll, Rivera, and several other people I interviewed for this story, absorbed the idea of “chosen family”—that those besides blood can decide to become kin—from this community. Though he and Rivera never considered dating, Carroll had already learned to be at ease with nonsexual intimate relationships with men. In other words, he had come to appreciate something that was once widely understood—as Godbeer, the historian, puts it, that “we can love without lusting.”\n\nIn many ways, Americans are already redefining what loving and living can look like. Just in the past several months, experts and public intellectuals from disparate ideological persuasions have encouraged heterosexual couples to look to the queer and immigrant communities for healthy models of marriage and family. The coronavirus pandemic, by underscoring human vulnerability and interdependence, has inspired people to imagine networks of care beyond the nuclear family. Polyamory and asexuality, both of which push back against the notion that a monogamous sexual relationship is the key to a fulfilling adult life, are rapidly gaining visibility. Expanding the possible roles that friends can play in one another’s lives could be the next frontier.\n\nOther changes in American households may be opening up space for alternative forms of committed relationships. Fewer and fewer Americans can count on having a spouse as a lifelong co-star. By the time they’ve gotten married—if they’ve done so at all—most Americans have spent a considerable part of their adulthood single. The tally of Americans’ unpartnered years grows once you tabulate the marriages that end because of divorce or a spouse’s death (about one-third of older women are widowed). According to a 2017 Pew Research Center report, 42 percent of American adults don’t live with a spouse or partner.\n\nWe’re also in the midst of what former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has called a growing public-health crisis in the United States: loneliness. In a 2018 survey, one-fifth of Americans reported always or often feeling lonely. Being alone does not portend loneliness—nor does being partnered necessarily prevent loneliness—but these data suggest that plenty of people would appreciate a confidant and a regular dose of physical affection, needs only amplified by the pandemic. Americans, who’ve long been encouraged to put all their eggs in the marriage basket, may come to rely upon a wider array of social relationships out of necessity.\n\nA platonic partnership may not feel right for everyone, and as is true with dating, even those who want a mate might not be able to find a suitable one. But these relationships have spillover benefits for those in close proximity to them. Tillotson told me that she thinks all her relationships have been brightened by her closeness with West. Their romantic partners appreciate that the friendship lessens their emotional load; their mutual friends treat Tillotson and West as a reliable unit to turn to when they’re in need; their veteran community has been strengthened by the volunteering they’ve done together. Their platonic partnership fits Godbeer’s description of how Americans viewed friendship centuries ago, that it “not only conferred personal happiness but also nurtured qualities that would radiate outward and transform society as a whole.” Though Tillotson and West’s relationship serves these broader purposes, they choose to be bound to each other primarily for the joy and support they personally receive. Tillotson thinks of her romantic partner as “the cherry on the cake.” She and West, she explained, “we’re the cake.”",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Over its 75-year history, the People’s Republic of China has suffered numerous traumas, but perhaps none with longer-lasting consequences than land reform—a violent campaign of torture, murder, and mob rule that the Communist Party enacted in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The program’s stated intent was to redistribute property to landless farmers, but in reality it was used to bring huge swaths of Chinese society to heel through the brutal persecution of landowners.\n\nThis history is the governing party’s ultimate taboo, its unspoken original sin. Over the decades, independent historians and ordinary people in China have at times managed to publicly criticize some of the party’s actions—even major upheavals such as the Cultural Revolution—without facing reprisal. But land reform is so fundamental to how the current government took power that no citizen may portray it as anything other than a benevolent campaign that brought fairness and prosperity to China’s long-suffering farmers.\n\nThis context is what makes Fang Fang’s novel Soft Burial, recently translated into English by Michael Berry, so electrifying. Starting around the turn of the 21st century, independent historians began to explore land reform, drawing on oral histories to challenge the party’s narrative. But their works were either quickly banned or circulated only underground. Soft Burial, first published in China in 2016, was different. Fang is one of her country’s best-known novelists, and a longtime member of its literary establishment. After Soft Burial was published, it won a sought-after literary prize and was widely discussed in mainstream Chinese media, until backlash prompted censors to ban it.\n\nAlthough many people have written China off as a completely closed, authoritarian country, it has a broad movement of independent writers, thinkers, and filmmakers—some on the fringes of society but some, like Fang, firmly part of the establishment. Her novel is one of the first works to gain a mainstream readership in China that uncovers the buried reality of land reform, the reasons the party pushed it so brutally, and the inherited pain it has visited upon Chinese people. The widespread, if short-lived, conversation surrounding the book shows that even a powerful authoritarian state can’t fully erase history.\n\nRead: Chinese leaders are scared of their country’s history\n\nAbroad, Fang is best known as the author of Wuhan Diary, an account of the city’s 2020 COVID lockdown, which initially controlled the virus’s spread but set the stage for years of arbitrary, harsh, and increasingly ineffective shutdowns across China. Berry had begun translating Soft Burial shortly after it was published in China but shifted to Wuhan Diary in 2020 because of its topicality. Now Soft Burial has been published alongside Berry’s translation of The Running Flame, one of Fang’s other novels, which tells the story of a woman on death row for killing her abusive husband.\n\nSoft Burial’s title comes from the practice of interring someone without a coffin, which in traditional China would happen to the very poor, or after a war or disaster—the sort of catastrophe that befell rural China when land reform became a tool for social revolution and authoritarian control.\n\nThe novel begins in the present, centering on the story of an old widow in the Chinese city of Wuhan. As a very young woman, in 1952, she had been pulled unconscious out of a river, after nearly drowning. When she awoke, she had no memory. She evidenced some education—she could recognize storylines from a classic novel and some mythology—but China had been taken over by a Communist Party that was intent on violent struggle against elites. And so a kindly doctor advised her to hold on to her amnesia: Illiteracy and ignorance, he told her, were the best forms of protection.\n\nAfter several years, the doctor was widowed, and he married the rescued woman. They had a son, who found success in China’s southern boomtowns, eventually returned to Wuhan, and bought an opulent villa for his family. But when he moves his mother in, the wealth and prosperity trigger something in the old woman—it all reminds her of something dangerous, something she can’t quite put her finger on. Exhausted and bewildered, she falls into a coma, and while unconscious, she travels through the 18 levels of hell, a concept found in many Chinese religious traditions—each revealing more of her past. We learn that the old woman was from a landowning family, and lost her first husband’s family, as well as her own parents and brother, to mass suicide and murder.\n\nThe novel’s other storyline revolves around her son, who discovers diaries revealing that his father, the doctor, was also born into a landowning family but had hidden his background. When the son travels to Sichuan province with an academic friend who intends to create an inventory of old villas, he discovers the house where his mother had lived with her first husband and in-laws, and begins to piece together his family’s repressed history.\n\nLong before the Communists took power, reformers of all stripes had advocated land redistribution. In the mid-20th century, about 80 percent of Chinese lived in the countryside, and many lacked property. But in numerous cases, landholders were not exactly fat cats. Independent research has shown that in the eastern part of Sichuan province, where parts of Soft Burial take place, landholders owned on average just 2.4 acres, and many worked the fields alongside hired hands.\n\nIn the late 1940s, as the Communists gained the upper hand in China’s civil war, they began to aggressively pursue their goal of radically restructuring Chinese political, economic, and cultural life. The biggest obstacle standing in the party’s way was the landed gentry, or shi.\n\nThis mostly educated group had been the backbone of traditional China. They built schools and roads, managed temples, and raised militias to provide local security. Because the imperial bureaucracy wasn’t large and did not penetrate to small towns or villages, much of local life was run by this gentry. So if the party was going to succeed, this class had to be destroyed and replaced with a new bureaucratic caste of Communist officials.\n\nAfter taking power in October 1949, the party stoked the flames of anger and hatred against landowners, resulting in the first mass campaign of violence in the People’s Republic. Historians estimate that at least 2 million people were killed, including entire families. Survivors were beaten, tortured, and sexually assaulted, and the former gentry and their descendants became a class of formal outcasts for the next 30 years—denied jobs, promotions, and higher education.\n\nOver the following decades, rural China plunged into ever-greater crises. In the mid-’50s, the party expropriated the land it had given to the farmers, eventually leading to the Great Famine, which killed as many as 45 million people. Even today, farmers have land-use rights but do not own their land, which deprives them of capital and subjects them to party directives on how to use it. During the party’s push to urbanize China in the 2000s, many farmers had to surrender even these meager rights in exchange for an apartment and a welfare check.\n\nMichael Albertus: How authoritarians turn rural areas into their strongholds\n\nAs Fang unravels her characters’ stories, she also reveals the complexity of examining the past. In their own ways, both mother and son are reluctant excavators of these buried memories. The woman has almost completely repressed them, revisiting them only at the very end of her life. For the son, digging into his family’s history is a risky enterprise; he has made good in modern China and doesn’t want to rock the boat. When his friend encourages him to explore further, he hesitates. The safest choice, he thinks, is to forget the past and move on with life.\n\nAs a work of literature, the novel has its flaws. The stories are almost too perfectly synchronized, with every loose end tied up. Not only does the young man coincidentally travel to the same part of the country where his mother was born, but he finds the very villa where she once lived with her in-laws, and the secret tunnel she used to escape. At one point, part of this story is told to a character in the novel who exclaims, “It sounds like a television drama!”\n\nStill, it is a riveting read, and an illuminating one; it shows how China’s independent thinkers often feed on one another’s work. Soft Burial echoes the work of Tan Song, a scholar who spent years researching land reform in Sichuan province. Other writers and artists have also begun to mine this era for clues to China’s current authoritarian malaise. At last year’s Berlin Film Festival, the independent filmmaker Wang Xiaoshuai screened a movie on land reform that drew a direct line from those events to the impoverishment of rural life today.\n\nNot surprisingly, the subject remains taboo. In 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a list of 10 “historically nihilist” rumors that must be banned—one of them, of course, was land reform. The government’s goal is to keep its people in a state of amnesia over the country’s history, but novels such as Soft Burial show that in China, the past will always get dug up.",

        "content": "If the president and his team have their way, much of the executive branch will be transformed from watchdogs or independent actors into the president’s foot soldiers.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nUpdated at 5:37 p.m. ET on March 27, 2025\n\n“What we’re trying to do is identify the pockets of independence” in the federal government “and seize them,” Russ Vought told The New York Times in 2023. As the Trump administration’s first two months prove, he wasn’t bluffing.\n\nBack then, Vought was a leading figure in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s effort to provide a blueprint for a Republican presidency. Now Vought is the head of the Office of Management and Budget—which he’s described as “a president’s air-­traffic control system”—and Donald Trump is following Project 2025’s plans to quash any part of the executive branch that doesn’t bend to his will. One key step in that plan is coaxing the Supreme Court to throw out a ruling that has shaped the government for 90 years.\n\nLast week, Trump announced that he was firing two Democratic federal trade commissioners, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law, has five seats, and no more than three may belong to any party. It is what’s known as an “independent agency” or “independent regulatory agency”—a part of the executive branch whose members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate but, beyond that, are not directed by the White House.\n\nAs I write in my forthcoming book about Project 2025, that concept is anathema to the right-wing thinkers in Trumpism’s intellectual clique. They believe that a president should have full control over anyone in the executive branch. “The notion of an independent agency—­whether that’s a flat-­out independent agency” such as the Federal Communications Commission “or an agency that has parts of it that view itself as independent, like the Department of Justice—­we’re planting a flag and saying we reject that notion completely,” Vought told NPR in 2023.\n\nThis is not the first time that Trump has moved to fire an official whose job is supposed to be secure, save in cases of misconduct. This includes Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, whose case I described earlier this month; Federal Election Commission Chair Ellen Weintraub, who is challenging her dismissal; and the National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, who was reinstated by a court this month. All of these dismissals appear to plainly violate statutes, but the FTC firings are an even more direct provocation. That’s because the Supreme Court precedent that protects officials at independent agencies specifically refers to a president’s attempt to fire an FTC commissioner in 1933. (Today, the two fired FTC commissioners sued Trump, arguing that the dismissals violated federal law. A spokesperson for the White House said in a statement that “the Trump administration operated within its lawful authority” in firing the commissioners.)\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt’s power struggle with the Supreme Court is well known, but he also feuded with other officials who opposed his major overhaul of the government. One was William Humphrey, who’d been appointed to the FTC by Calvin Coolidge, a fierce small-government conservative. Roosevelt tried to pressure Humphrey to quit, but he refused, so Roosevelt attempted to fire him—not for any specific cause, but simply because they disagreed on policy.\n\nHumphrey once again refused to acquiesce and sued. He died the following year, but his estate continued to fight the case, taking it to the Supreme Court. For this reason, the case is known as Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. (Certain officials at Columbia University and the law firm of Paul Weiss could learn from this persistence in the face of adversity and even death.) The court ruled 9–0 against the president in 1935. The justices found that although the FTC was housed in the executive branch, it also served some independent legislative and judicial functions. “Such a body cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive,” they wrote, adding, “It is quite evident that one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another cannot be depended upon to maintain an attitude of independence against the latter’s will.”\n\nRoosevelt was furious—this was one of the Supreme Court decisions that led him to attempt to pack the court two years later—but Humphrey’s Executor became an important pillar of the federal government as we know it for decades. For most of that time, conservatives have viewed Roosevelt’s presidency as an example of the evils of a president with excessive power.\n\nThe right is no longer so skeptical about presidential power. Some right-wing thinkers have espoused the “unitary executive theory,” which holds (to oversimplify) that the president should have control over all executive-branch actions. The George W. Bush administration brought this theory into the mainstream. Yet even though the Supreme Court has somewhat narrowed the reach of its 1935 ruling over time, Humphrey’s Executor remains an important limitation on the president’s powers.\n\nNow, however, Trump allies—frustrated by how the checks and balances of independent agencies (among other things) prevented him from enacting much of his agenda during his first presidency—are seeking greater control than any modern president has. For this reason, I argue in my book that Project 2025’s approach is not conservative but self-consciously radical. In Project 2025’s chapter on the FTC, Adam Candeub (now the general counsel of the FCC) writes, “The Supreme Court ruling in Humphrey’s Executor upholding agency independence seems ripe for revisiting—and perhaps sooner than later.” In another chapter, the former Justice Department official Gene Hamilton argues, “The next conservative Administration should formally take the position that Humphrey’s Executor violates the Constitution’s separation of powers.”\n\nThis may be the purpose the most recent firings serve for the White House. As the Trump administration lines up test cases for the courts, it would only be fitting to try to get the Supreme Court to overrule Humphrey’s with a case from the FTC. But if the precedent is overturned, much of the executive branch would be transformed from watchdogs or independent actors into the president’s foot soldiers, raising the risk of tyranny—either of the majority or of the president himself. Having established that independent agencies functioned as parts of the legislative and judicial branches, the unanimous majority in 1935 laid out the principle at work: “The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others, has often been stressed and is hardly open to serious question.”\n\nThe court’s logic remains convincing, but its confident assertion that the need for balance is a given has not aged so well.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nPresident Donald Trump withdrew his nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, citing the razor-thin margin that Republicans have in the House. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, announced that 10,000 full-time employees will be laid off across health agencies.

Sign up to get an email every time a new column comes out.\n\nAs a professor, my primary vocation is to teach young adults skills that will prepare them to excel in their careers. The implicit assumption society makes is that professional excellence requires formal training, whereas excellence in the rest of life does not. There is no Harvard School of Leisure, after all. Work demands discipline and training; nonwork is easy and enjoyable and comes naturally.\n\nOur higher-education system, including my university, operates on this assumption. But to me, it’s very questionable. Leisure is not at all straightforward or easy. I have no interest in frittering away a minute of my day on fruitless pursuits. I want everything I do to be generative. I want to use my nonwork activities, as much as my work ones, to become a wiser, happier, more effective, better person. Leisure is serious business.\n\nMy attitude is not, in fact, especially original: The 20th-century German philosopher Josef Pieper believed that when we understand and practice leisure properly, we can achieve our best selves—and even our capacity to transform society for the better. But to do leisure like this, we must treat it with every bit as much seriousness as we do our careers.\n\nArthur C. Brooks: How to have your most fulfilling vacation ever\n\nGiven their observable behavior, people evidently believe that leisure is desirable. As Aristotle reasoned in his Nicomachean Ethics, “We toil that we may rest, and war that we may be at peace.” When our work is most demanding, we typically define leisure as its opposite: complete inactivity. For example, when the burned-out 51-year-old CEO of a $68 billion investment firm abruptly quit his job in 2022, he explained to reporters what he planned to do next: “I just want to go sit at the beach and do nothing.” Even if we’re not finding our work overtaxing, we still talk about taking a break from it that will allow us to reenergize—in order to work more and better. Either way, we’re defining leisure in relation to work, as the absence of work or as an adjunct to work.\n\nPieper rejected this whole way of thinking. A follower of Plato and Thomas Aquinas, Pieper believed that leisure was an inherently valuable, constructive part of life, and he thought we misunderstood leisure when we defined it as work’s opposite. In his 1948 book, Leisure: The Basis of Culture, he described it as an attitude of openness to the world through deep contemplation. In Pieper’s conception, the opposite of leisure is not work, but acedia, an ancient-Greek word that means spiritual or mental sloth.\n\nLeisure, in other words, is far from the modern notion of just chillin’. It is a serious business, and if you don’t do leisure well, you will never find life’s full meaning. Properly understood, leisure is the work you do for yourself as a person without an economic compulsion driving you. For Pieper, this work of leisure—no contradiction, in his view—would not involve such “acediac” activities as scrolling social media and chuckling at memes, getting drunk, or binge-streaming some show. Rather, true leisure would involve philosophical reflection, deep artistic experiences, learning new ideas or skills, spending time in nature, or deepening personal relationships.\n\nPieper especially focused on faith experiences, because he believed that “culture lives on religion through divine worship.” Perhaps you have never thought of going to a house of worship as leisure, but Pieper would say that’s because you never took your leisure seriously enough.\n\nYou might be thinking that this approach to leisure doesn’t sound especially fun to you, not so chill, but social scientists’ findings suggest that Pieper knew a thing or two about well-being. We may intuitively think that the best way to get happier is, like the CEO, to “go sit at the beach and do nothing.” But researchers have found that this kind of do-nothing leisure, including vacation travel, provides only minor, temporary boosts of happiness. What gives us more sustained well-being are pursuits involving social engagement, personal reflection, and outdoor activities.\n\nArthur C. Brooks: Aristotle’s 10 rules for a good life\n\nThe point here is that just as we should be excellent at our jobs, we should become excellent at leisure. Doing leisure well will generate the sort of growth in our well-being that work cannot provide. We need to take the time to dwell on life’s big questions without distraction, to learn to appreciate what is beautiful, to transcend our workaday lives and consider what is divine.\n\nTo achieve excellence at anything in life requires time, effort, and discipline. In this spirit, here are three ways to build your “leisure aptitude.”\n\n1. Structure your leisure.\n\nThe Catholic bishop Fulton Sheen was famous throughout the United States as a radio and television star from the 1930s through the ’60s. His lasting legacy, however, was instructing people to undertake what he called a “Holy Hour” of prayer, scripture reading, and meditation each day. He advised everyone whose schedule permitted it to keep this practice at the same time every day and for the whole hour. Millions of priests and laity still do so to this day, and people swear by it as one of the most helpful parts of their faith.\n\nWhether you are religious or not, consider observing your own Holy Hour. Maybe it can be a time in the morning when you read something truly meaningful, or a walk after lunch when you leave your device behind, or a period of uninterrupted conversation after dinner with the person you love best. But structure this Holy Hour into your day as you would an important work meeting.\n\n2. Don’t fritter away your leisure.\n\nOne of the biggest killers of productive leisure is the inability to get started. If you have an hour off, you might start by reading the news, then answering email messages … and before you know it, the time has passed in merely routine and forgettable activity. To avoid this, program the time in advance and get right into it. If the leisure activity is to read a certain book from 6 to 7 a.m., have the book ready, start promptly, and do absolutely nothing else. Put your phone on silent and out of reach, and block all distractions. This is crucial time.\n\n3. Set specific leisure goals.\n\nHumans are inherently goal-oriented. In any area of personal improvement, whether your career or your health, goals—and making progress toward them—are central to staying motivated. For example, you probably won’t be able to keep to an exercise plan unless you have the ambition to get stronger and healthier in a measurable way, and see regular, tangible advancement toward that end.\n\nGoal orientation should also apply to your leisure activities. Instead of randomly dipping into a holy book in your religious tradition, say, set about reading the entire volume in a year. Similarly, your goal for daily meditation might be to work toward a week-long silent retreat. Or if your leisure purpose is to listen to music, focus on a particular composer with an end in mind: Listen and learn about J. S. Bach every day, for example, with the goal of attending a summer Bach festival as an expert listener.\n\nDerek Thompson: The free-time paradox in America\n\nPieper’s philosophy of leisure offers more than a formula for organizing your own recreational time; it also asserts that leisure is “the basis of culture.” How so? Left to our educational experience and its basic assumptions, many of us naturally oscillate between being Homo economicus and Homo trivialus—in other words, a cycle of laborious slog by day and unproductive, numbing pleasure-pursuits in the evenings and at weekends. This is a culture of unenriching, unrelieved monotony.\n\nWe have two ways to change this: One is through work; the other is through leisure. For many people, the former is not possible, at least not in the short run. But for everyone, leisure can be customized to make it enlivening, not deadening. How you use your leisure can be made to reflect your values and connect with other people in deeply meaningful ways. That is a culture of joy and interest I want to be part of.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Medical dramas are like the old aphorism about pizza and sex: Even when they’re bad, they’re still pretty good. Since the glory days of ER faded in the late ’90s, there have been plenty of TV series of varying quality set in hospitals. But the best ones have always taken a flashier storytelling approach: the elaborate mystery-solving of House, the soapy romance antics of Grey’s Anatomy, the early-20th-century grotesqueries of The Knick. Those efforts, however, have been few and far between, leaving wanting viewers to subsist on thin gruel such as Chicago Med, Code Black, and The Resident—all pale imitations of ER at best. I had been longing for something more meat-and-potatoes—and then along came The Pitt, Max’s hit new show starring ER’s Noah Wyle. The first season is still airing, yet it’s already without question the finest example of the genre in more than a generation.\n\nI’ll admit, somewhat cheekily, that my interest in The Pitt was first piqued by an ongoing lawsuit. The author Michael Crichton’s estate sued Warner Bros. over The Pitt’s very existence, arguing that it was an unauthorized, thinly disguised reboot of ER. Crichton (who died in 2008) created the NBC smash in 1994, which was based on his 1974 screenplay about his own experiences as a medical student; his actual participation in it throughout its 15 years on the air, though, was minimal. The other thing that caught my eye was Wyle’s involvement, along with that of ER creative luminaries such as R. Scott Gemmill and John Wells. Their presence certainly suggested a program that was trying to harken back to the genre’s better days: straightforward stories of doctors and nurses moving through case after case with steadfast professionalism.\n\nIt turns out that The Pitt’s rendition of this formula has a twist, perhaps enough to distinguish it from ER in a copyright sense. The 15-episode first season encompasses a single shift in the emergency room of the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital, hour by hour. Where an installment of ER might take place over a day or two, The Pitt’s structure allows it to be super granular. The original regular ensemble of ER was just four doctors, a medical student, and a nurse, for example, whereas The Pitt has a credited ensemble of seven doctors, two students, and a nurse. The tighter focus allows the story to explore, with even more realism than its predecessors, how trauma cases progress. Meanwhile, the slower pace helps viewers settle into the comforting routine of watching people be good at their job.\n\nRead: Chicago Med and the state of the hospital drama\n\nThat repetition is the secret sauce to any great procedural series: Audiences love watching people be good at their job. That doesn’t mean these stories can’t include interpersonal conflicts and flawed characters. But the gestalt of almost any long-running drama about professionals such as detectives, lawyers, and doctors is the mega-satisfaction that comes with observing core competence. Crimes will be solved, cases closed, and maladies healed; yes, sometimes things will go wrong, but only rarely—so that the program can emphasize how often things go right instead. The Pitt follows an ultra-concentrated version of this formula by zeroing in on an emergency room, because the job of a trauma doctor is just to stabilize patients and then move them along. Plenty of emotion is mixed in with all the medical jargon, but the task before each member of the staff is always the same: keep beds clear and patients moving.\n\nWyle has plenty of experience projecting competency after playing the emergency physician John Carter for most of ER’s run. Carter arrives as a fumbling, awkward, lovable med student—the audience surrogate in the chaotic and intense environment of a fictional Chicago emergency ward. But he stuck around long enough to become the wise veteran, setting the tone for the other residents and functioning as a sort of moral bedrock. I grew up watching Carter’s journey and continue to think that Wyle is one of TV’s most underrated actors; though he got five Emmy nominations for ER, other cast members such as George Clooney and Julianna Margulies emerged as bigger stars. I worried, however, that The Pitt might feel like little more than an easy nostalgia play for him.\n\nI shouldn’t have: His performance as Dr. Michael Robinavitch, known to everyone as “Robby,” has a pretty healthy distance from Dr. Carter—he’s earthier, grumpier, and appropriately world-weary in his leadership. Robby, the senior attending physician in the hospital’s ER, is reckoning with PTSD from working the nightmarish early days of the coronavirus pandemic, a current-day wrinkle that The Pitt handles with a lot of care and sensitivity. Apart from that contemporary struggle, Robby faces timeless dilemmas, in which he often assumes the role of a reliable mentor. Not all of those dilemmas are high-risk, either: One of the most memorable problems he’s dealt with thus far has been his need to use the restroom, only to be held up repeatedly.\n\nRead: Everything TV taught you about autopsies is wrong\n\nWyle’s steadiness is pivotal to The Pitt’s success, but just as crucial is the carefully formed ensemble around him; the real pleasure of any good hospital show is watching doctors philosophically ping off one another. Over the slow build of the season, character details emerge without need for much didactic exposition. A quick favorite is Dr. Mel King (played by Taylor Dearden), whose experience taking care of her neurodivergent sister has made her a particularly empathetic doctor. But pricklier characters, such as Isa Briones’s Trinity Santos (an impatient intern with ambitions beyond her station) and Victoria Javadi (Shabana Azeez), a “nepo baby” medical student struggling to distinguish herself, are vital figures in many of The Pitt’s background plots. Tackling tough medical crises comes first, but the writers have skillfully set a dozen subplots bubbling on the stovetop and tended to them throughout the season.\n\nThe mix between the personal and the professional is key to making a hospital drama work. So why has The Pitt been so much more rapturously received than its contemporaries? Chicago Med, for example, has delivered solid ratings for years on NBC, but The Pitt has become the stuff of online discourse and fandom in a manner that feels unusual for a straightforward procedural today. The easiest answer to its popularity is the genre blending—that the real-time concept, in the vein of the espionage thriller 24, helps the series stand out from the competition. This format comes with constraints; each episode can cover only a specific portion of a single day. But the show uses its efficient storytelling to create a quiet sort of magic—something that is very, very hard for even the best TV programs to get right. Just a few moments with anyone gives the viewer enough to remember them by; we pick up quickly that, say, Dr. Cassie McKay (Fiona Dourif) is adept at sussing out patient backstories, and that Dr. Samira Mohan (Supriya Ganesh) is compassionate to a fault. The audience becomes invested from minute one, making it possible to build impressive emotional arcs despite the restrictions of The Pitt’s central gimmick.\n\nMy biggest anxiety about the show’s future is what will happen when its small-scale realism must be trumped by end-of-season stakes. Every major hospital show has confronted this tonal clash throughout its run; stalwarts such as ER and Grey’s Anatomy have depended on ever larger and more absurd set pieces (tank invasions, ferry disasters, helicopter crashes) to ratchet up the action. These situations always come off as incongruous at best and like transparent efforts to drum up ratings at worst. The major incident that The Pitt has been leading up to—a shooting at a music festival—was telegraphed well in advance, by comparison, and it strikes me as finding the right balance between a big moment and the smaller moments within it. The shooting is the kind of scenario that would overwhelm an already taxed emergency room, but it’s also the kind of real-world crisis that’s depressingly common of late. If the next season of The Pitt (which Max has already ordered) sticks to this grounded level of catastrophe for ballast, I’ll be satisfied—because what I’ll really be coming back for is the little things.",

        "content": "U.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen. I didn’t think it could be real. Then the bombs started falling.\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.\n\nI, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\n\nThis is going to require some explaining.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis—an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam”—soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.\n\nThis is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nI accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nA message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”\n\nThe message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”\n\nRead: Here are the attack plans that Trump’s advisers shared on Signal\n\nThe term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nOne minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.\n\nThe principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”\n\nThat was the end of the Thursday text chain.\n\nAfter receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.\n\nThe next day, things got even stranger.\n\nAt 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (High side, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”\n\nAt this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”\n\nThe Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nA person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”\n\nThen, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\n\nAt 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”\n\nThe Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”\n\nA few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”\n\nThe account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)\n\nThe user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”\n\nAt this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”\n\nA screenshot from the Signal group shows debate over the president’s views ahead of the attack.\n\nThat message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”\n\nAfter reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nAt 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\n\nThe only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)\n\nAccording to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.\n\nI went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.\n\nA screenshot from the Signal group shows reactions to the strikes.\n\nOn Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s This Week and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”\n\nThe Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.\n\nEarlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?\n\nBrian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”\n\nWilliam Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”\n\nI have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.\n\nRead: A conversation with Jeffrey Goldberg about his extraordinary scoop\n\nConceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.\n\nAll of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.\n\nHegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.\n\nThere was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.\n\n“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.\n\n“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.\n\nSeveral former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)\n\nWaltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nShane Harris contributed reporting.",

View More\n\nGrowing up on the Kansas side of Kansas City in the early 1960s, Toby Phalen was the oldest of seven children—five girls, two boys—in a middle-class Catholic family. When she was 5, her father was burning willow branches in their backyard and the fire flared in his face. She saw him come into the house. His ears were gone and his flesh looked like it was rolling down his shoulders and arms, “like it was my mom taking off her pantyhose at night,” she recalls.\n\nHe was hospitalized for eight months, and Toby felt it was her responsibility as the eldest child to help take care of her younger siblings. Even then, she wanted to solve whatever problem was in front of her. She changed diapers, packed lunches, tried to provide stability in a stressful time. “She was less like a sister than like a third parent,” one of her siblings would later tell The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHer father eventually came home, and although he could barely move his arms, he started working again as a machinist at the railroad. He had a big family to feed. Every day, he’d crawl under the engines and spend hours reaching up to service the equipment, stretching his scalded skin. And he never complained. “Deal with what life gives you,” Toby’s dad would say whenever he heard one of his kids whining. It became the family mantra.\n\nToby internalized the lesson. She was a perfectionist, the type who spoiled the curve for her younger siblings. She never got drunk, never tried drugs. In high school, she was the president of the pep club and dated the star of the baseball team.\n\nShe tried not to question her circumstances. She tried to be positive and just go along. She doesn’t remember how her high-school boyfriend proposed, for example: “It was probably something like ‘We might as well get married.’ ” She said yes because she thought that was what she was supposed to do. They got married at 20, bought a house not far from her parents, and had three kids in four years. The middle child, their only daughter, died a few hours after birth.\n\nToby dealt with the pains of life by staying busy and ignoring whatever hurt. Her husband was a firefighter, and Toby worked at a utility company. Her sons played baseball, basketball, football, soccer. She tried not to miss a single game. On top of everything else, Toby attended college at night. She graduated summa cum laude with a double major in accounting and business administration.\n\nIn 1987, when she was 30 years old, she started working at Sprint. She was a project manager specializing in systems development. There was always a new problem to solve, a more efficient way to do something, and she’d work relentlessly to figure it out. But her 14-year career ended with the dot‑com bust of 2001.\n\nShe started working part-time at a veterinary clinic, assisting with procedures, answering phones, scheduling appointments. She’d always loved animals. As a girl, she’d sometimes wander out into the woods and stand there, listening to the sounds of nature, watching the spiders on a tree.\n\nIn 2004, Toby asked one of the vets about a lump on her neck, and the vet told her she needed to see a doctor immediately. It turned out to be thyroid cancer. It was treatable, but she was 47, and it got her thinking about how much time she might or might not have left. “I decided I wanted to do something to make the world a better place,” she says.\n\nIn the fog of cancer treatments, she spent a lot of time watching television, especially the Animal Planet reality show Cell Dogs. Each episode focuses on a different prison’s dog-adoption program, following inmates as they train unruly shelter dogs and prepare the animals to be sent to new homes. Toby decided that’s what she wanted to do: start a prison dog program.\n\nHer husband dismissed the idea, she recalls. “Toby, that’s just TV,” she remembers him saying. “People don’t do that in real life.” So she tried to do the closest thing possible, and started a dog-fostering program. She made a website, and within a week she heard from someone at the Lansing Correctional Facility, a state prison in Leavenworth County, Kansas, asking if she’d have any interest in starting a program there.\n\n“I was like, ‘Yes! Oh my gosh, yes, that’s my dream!’ ”\n\nTwo days later, she drove to the prison and gave the executive staff a presentation. Two days after that, on August 13, 2004, she brought seven shelter dogs into the prison, and the Safe Harbor Prison Dog Program was born.\n\nThe idea was to let inmates who qualified with good behavior house dogs in their cells. With Toby’s guidance, they would prepare the dogs for adoption. A lot of these men had gone years—some, decades—without the affectionate touch of a human. But a prisoner could hug a dog, lie in bed with a dog, tell the dog his troubles—and the dog would look back with nothing but love.\n\nThe program changed the atmosphere in the prison. During the day, there were dogs in the yard, dogs walking down the halls with their handlers. “Anybody who wanted to come up and pet a dog could do so,” Toby says. “It softened everybody up.”\n\nMore inmates wanted dogs. And more people in the community started calling Toby when they found abandoned dogs. She quit working at the vet clinic and turned the barn behind her house into a kennel, where she kept the dogs before they were assigned to an inmate. Soon she was working from 6 a.m. to midnight every day: organizing adoptions, shuttling dogs back and forth to vet clinics for spaying and neutering, letting all the dogs in her barn out to run and play a few times a day.\n\nShe also spent several hours a day helping inmates train their dogs. Before Safe Harbor, she’d never been inside a prison, didn’t even know anyone who’d served time. Now there were weeks when she was at Lansing every day, more than some of the guards.\n\nFrom the August 2019 issue: The con man who became a true-crime writer\n\nIn 18 months, she facilitated about 1,000 adoptions. In the local news, she posed for photos with dogs and inmates outside their cells. She started getting donations—money for dog food, leashes, vet visits—from across the country. She sent a weekly newsletter to thousands of subscribers.\n\nToby says her husband resented the program. Though she didn’t admit it to anyone at the time, not even herself, when she looks back now she sees that she was unhappy in her marriage from the beginning. She says that her husband would sometimes disappear to play golf. A few months after they were married, Toby decided she’d take lessons, so they could play together. But when she told her husband, he said that before she took lessons, she should find someone to golf with.\n\n“Well,” she said, “I thought I would golf with you.”\n\n“No,” she remembers him saying. “I golf with my friends.”\n\nThe affirmation she wasn’t getting at home, she now got from the dogs, who adored her. When prison officials and guards noticed the mood in the prison improving, she became popular with them, too. And the dog handlers? They seemed to love Toby most of all.\n\nThe first time Toby met John Manard, the sun was behind him and it looked like a halo. Other inmates would approach her with some degree of hesitation, but Manard walked right up and told her she needed him in her program. “I’m probably the best dog handler you’ve ever met,” he said.\n\nHis confidence captivated her. But she told him he’d have to get approved by the prison, just like everybody else.\n\nHe did, and a few weeks later he was among the prisoners gathered to receive their foster dogs. Most were happy with whatever dog they got, just glad to have a companion. But not Manard. He evaluated each dog. He petted them, examined them, then took a second or two to contemplate. When he finally made a selection—a pit bull mix, Toby recalls—she was amused by the whole interaction. She’d never seen anything like it.\n\nManard was 6 foot 2 and lean, with close-cropped red hair and an assortment of tattoos. The one arching over his navel read hooligan. He walked with a swagger. “There was just something different about him,” Toby says.\n\nShe learned that he was serving a life sentence for his participation, at age 17, in a carjacking that resulted in a man getting fatally shot. Manard said he wasn’t the one who pulled the trigger, and even the prosecutor said he believed that—but nonetheless, Manard had committed a felony that led to someone’s death, so he was convicted of first-degree murder. Toby didn’t think that seemed fair; Manard appeared capable of redemption. He was 25 when he met Toby. She was 47.\n\nA few months after starting the dog program, Toby heard some inmates making sexual comments about her. When she informed prison officials, she says, she was told to keep some of the dog handlers she’d gotten to know with her when she was inside the prison.\n\nOne day she was with two handlers when another inmate threatened her. He wanted his girlfriend to adopt the dog he’d fostered, but she lived a few hours away and was having trouble getting a ride to the prison. It had been eight weeks. When Toby asked the inmate about it, he started yelling at her, swearing and raising his fists. Toby turned to the other handlers for help, but they were looking down, unwilling to challenge the man. She was certain she was about to get hit when she saw Manard walking toward her. She could feel the relief deep in her chest.\n\nManard told the man to go back to his cell. “Nobody was going to mess with John Manard,” Toby says.\n\nHe walked her out to the prison gate. As soon as she got to her van, she collapsed in tears. She could barely keep her hands from shaking long enough to call her contact at the prison, to inform him that she was never going back inside. She said she’d keep running the program, but only from outside the prison walls.\n\nThat was a Sunday. The next day, she says, she got a call back: Her contact in the warden’s office told her she could have Manard paged whenever she arrived, and he would meet her at the front gate and walk her to her appointments. He was only supposed to escort her through the prison, but Manard stayed with her during her training sessions. Soon they were spending hours together every day.\n\nLater, the warden disputed the idea that Toby ever had an assigned escort. In an interview with The Kansas City Star, he said that she could go wherever she needed to in the prison alone. Of course, Toby was married, religious, such a responsible citizen—nobody at the prison could have anticipated what eventually happened.\n\nFrom the April 2018 issue: An OurTime.com con man and the women who busted him\n\nOne morning, Manard noticed that Toby looked distraught and asked her what was wrong. She’d been at the hospital all night, she explained. Her father had Stage 4 bladder cancer and had needed surgery. She’d come to the prison straight from the intensive-care unit.\n\n“Well,” Manard said. “Thank God your husband was there to drive you.”\n\n“He wasn’t there,” she recalls telling Manard. “He said there’s no sense in both of us not getting a good night’s sleep.”\n\nManard shook his head.\n\n“Toby, why are you married to him?”\n\nShe thought about it for a moment and didn’t have an answer. She thought about it later that day, too, when she left the prison. She thought about it all that night and the next day. She knew it shouldn’t be such a hard question—she’d been married for close to three decades—but she couldn’t come up with an answer.\n\n“That’s when I realized, This isn’t a marriage. This is a convenient house-sharing arrangement,” she says. “Once you open your mind and you think those things, you can’t stop them.”\n\nThey spent hours a day together but weren’t allowed to touch. No physical contact, that was the rule.\n\nShe says that she’d told her husband 10 years earlier that she was thinking about leaving, but that he’d dismissed the idea. She had no reason for a divorce: He didn’t hit her, he didn’t cheat on her, he wasn’t an alcoholic, and he had a good job at the fire department. Besides, her family loved him—her siblings considered Toby’s husband their own brother—and they would never want her to divorce him.\n\n“I did believe him that my family would talk me into staying,” she says. “I didn’t see any way out.”\n\nBut now she felt someone notice her. She felt someone recognize that she had needs.\n\n“If someone had flirted with me at a gas pump when I was pumping gas, I would have just not even responded to them and I would have gotten in my car and drove away,” she says. But Manard’s flirting seemed safer, harmless. He was in prison, after all. Nothing could come of it. She allowed herself to think about Manard more and more. The way he’d compliment the color of her eyes and tell her how much he liked her hair.\n\n“You deserve someone who wants to make you the center of their world,” he said.\n\nShe’d never heard anything like this. Looking back, she says it was “like pouring water on a dying plant.”\n\nThey spent hours a day together but weren’t allowed to touch. No physical contact, that was the rule. Sometimes, though, she’d part a dog’s fur for a tick treatment and Manard would lean over to help, and their hands would brush against each other and linger for a moment.\n\n“It was so insanely desirous,” Toby says. “It was something you wanted so bad and it was so off-limits. So it just made the chemistry even more sparky.” Sitting in her kitchen, thinking about it 15 years later, she sighs. “It was just so intense.”\n\nThe electricity between them built over weeks, months. Once, Manard asked her if she’d be with him if he weren’t in prison. She thought about this hypothetical scenario. “I believe I would,” she said.\n\nRead: The long odds against New York’s fugitive prisoners\n\nHe told her he loved her. And that he wanted to escape and be with her. At first she laughed it off. That would break so many rules! But he brought it up again and again. Sometimes, as she was driving around town, she’d see a for rent sign and think: If he was out of prison, I would get this little apartment.\n\nManard would later say in an interview that the question about being with him had been sort of a joke, but when Toby said yes, he became obsessed with the notion. He’d toss out ideas for how to escape. Maybe he could put himself in a box and have it mailed out? Maybe he could sneak out on the truck that delivered food to the kitchen? At one point he contemplated just climbing the fences in the yard.\n\n“There were a lot of bad ideas,” Toby says. It became a puzzle, a game.\n\nThe prison was full of 18-by-36-inch cardboard boxes; the inmates used them to carry their belongings when they moved to a different cell. Manard set about trying to fit himself into one of these boxes. Every time, the box either collapsed or burst. He lost more than 20 pounds in a few weeks to make himself fit. Then one day he told Toby that he’d dreamed of a certain way of pretzeling himself in. When he woke up, he tried it, and it worked.\n\nIt all still felt like a game. Toby wasn’t plotting to help a convicted murderer escape from prison. She was just figuring out solutions to new problems.\n\nThen one of the unit leaders at the prison asked Toby to remove some old equipment that had been sitting around: bowls, leashes, and a big wire dog crate. A crate big enough to fit an 18-by-36-inch box inside. Piece by piece, it felt like they were solving an abstract problem together.\n\nAround the same time, Manard told Toby he wanted a cellphone, so that they could talk anytime. She remembers him saying he knew someone who could get him one, but it would cost $500. She liked the idea of being able to talk anytime, but the price seemed exorbitant. Toby didn’t get searched going into the prison, so she snuck in a phone and gave it to him.\n\n“That was one line crossed,” she says. “And then the next lines just got bigger.”\n\nOver the course of a few weeks, they talked on the phone for 12,000 minutes—200 hours. One morning, Toby’s husband found a text message that read: “good morning, baby. I love you.” Toby told him it was a wrong number. He said he didn’t think she was capable of cheating. “My naive thought was that if she wasn’t having relations with me,” he would later say, “then she wouldn’t be having them with anyone else either.”\n\nToby took more than $40,000 out of her 401(k). She bought a used truck for $5,000 and parked it in a storage unit between her house and the prison. When she first stopped in to look at the storage facility, she was told that because the building was new, it didn’t have security cameras yet—which seemed perfect.\n\nIt all still felt like a game. She wasn’t plotting to help a convicted murderer escape from prison. She was just figuring out solutions to new problems. Then, suddenly, they were setting a date—Sunday, February 12, 2006—and going over details. Manard told her he would get in the box, and that the box would be inside the crate when it was loaded onto a farm wagon and transferred into Toby’s van, along with some dogs she was taking to an adoption event that day. She went to Walmart and bought men’s clothes and enough food to last a month.\n\nToby says Manard assured her that she wouldn’t get in trouble, that everyone would think he’d manipulated her. She says she never thought she’d be gone forever. She figured she’d come home in a couple of months, tops. She convinced herself that her family would hardly notice: Her sons were 21 and 25 by then and had left home, and she already felt invisible to her husband.\n\nLooking back, Toby says a lot of what would have been reasonable questions were crowded out by an all-consuming desire to be with this man she’d now known for a year but had never kissed, never hugged, barely even touched. Instead of thinking through all the foreseeable consequences of their plan, she spent a lot of time imagining what it might be like to hold Manard’s hand, to hug him, to, as she puts it, “live like real people.”\n\nThe night before the escape was both terrifying and exhilarating. Toby was in the living room, finishing that week’s Safe Harbor newsletter. Her husband was in the recliner, watching TV. He got up and told her he was going to bed. She said she still had work to do.\n\n“Okay, goodnight,” he said as he ascended the stairs.\n\nInstead of saying “Goodnight” back to him, though, Toby accidentally said “Goodbye.”\n\nAs she heard the word leaving her mouth, she panicked. She could feel a twisting dread in her chest.\n\n“I thought, Holy crap! What if he asks me why I said goodbye?”\n\nHe didn’t.\n\nToby didn’t sleep that night. She kept going over all the things she needed to do. She worried she’d forget something, say something awkward, do the wrong thing.\n\nThe temperature the next morning was in the teens, and the wind was spitting snow. When she pulled her van up to the prison gate, she could see the dog handlers lined up, stomping their feet to stay warm while they waited for her to take their dogs. But there was no farm wagon, no wire dog crate. So she went into the officers’ shack to make small talk and wait.\n\nAs the minutes passed, she figured the wagon wasn’t coming. She was almost relieved. She could just go to the adoption event and go back to her life. But then she saw the farm wagon come around the corner.\n\nToby Dorr and John Manard at the Lansing Correctional Facility before she helped him escape. (Charlie Riedel / AP)\n\nSuddenly it all seemed real. She saw how flat the wagon’s tires were, how it just looked like it was carrying something much heavier than a few bowls and leashes. But nobody else seemed to notice. She asked the guards to open the gate.\n\nShe opened the back of her van for the dogs. She remembers an officer patting one of the dogs and saying, “Well, I hope you get adopted today!” As the dogs were loaded into the back, she opened the side door, so the inmates could load the crate. Once it was in, she quickly slid the door closed.\n\nDriving away from the prison, she thought maybe Manard wasn’t in the box after all. She called back behind her: “John, are you there? Are you in the crate?”\n\nThere was no answer. Again, she felt relieved. Planning the escape had been fun, but she was glad to be going to the adoption event. Then an arm burst out of the box, and she heard Manard laughing.\n\nHe told her he was hyperventilating and asked her to let him out, so she pulled over to open the crate. In the back of the van, he changed into the clothes she’d brought him. “Drive, Toby, drive!” Manard said. She headed toward her house, to put the dogs back in their kennels. Manard said they’d save time if she just let them out in a field, but she insisted. “I was not about to drop these dogs out in the field,” she says.\n\nAt her place, while Toby put the dogs in the barn, Manard went into the house and took two pistols. Toby never liked guns, but Manard told her they’d be carrying a lot of cash, and this would scare away anyone who tried to mess with them.\n\nThen they went to the storage facility. He drove the truck out and she backed the van in. She locked the unit, hopped into the truck, and off they went.\n\nThe plan was to take a circuitous route to a lakeside cabin in Tennessee that Manard had reserved under a fake name, using the cellphone Toby had given him. They wanted to stay off interstates and big highways. First they headed north, then east toward the Great Smoky Mountains. Manard was talking so fast, Toby could barely keep up. He kept giggling.\n\n“Look, Toby! I’m driving! It’s been 10 years and I can still drive!”\n\nHe was eating the snacks he’d asked her to buy, little chocolate donuts and Twizzlers. She sort of expected there to be a moment when they’d stop and maybe kiss for the first time. But he told her they needed to drive. They needed to get away.\n\nA few hours later they stopped at a rest stop. They came out of their respective bathrooms at the same time. That’s when he leaned down and kissed her. In front of the rest-stop bathrooms. It was the first time she’d kissed a man other than her husband. It was what everything had been building toward. It was a moment of pure elation.\n\nShe doesn’t remember how long it lasted, but she remembers that the next thing he did was ask her to give him her cellphone so he could throw it in a lake.\n\nAs he drove, Toby navigated with a road map. It would have been a 10-hour drive if they’d taken the most direct route, but because they stuck to back roads, the trip lasted nearly 24 hours. After not sleeping the night before the escape, and not sleeping during the drive—and after such an emotional, nerve-racking experience—Toby was exhausted. So much so that, as they got close to the cabin and she opened her laptop to find the directions she’d downloaded, she couldn’t remember what she’d named the file.\n\n“This isn’t a game, Toby,” she recalls Manard saying. “What did you name it?”\n\nShe suggested that they pull over at a diner and ask for directions.\n\n“He just went ballistic,” Toby says. He started screaming, driving erratically, hitting the steering wheel. “He said, ‘I don’t even know why I brought you, anyway. I should just throw you out of this truck right now and just keep on going. I don’t need you!’ ”\n\nShe’d never seen him act like this. It dawned on her that she didn’t have her phone. She’d given him all her cash. She didn’t even know where she was. She started crying.\n\nThen, as quickly as his anger came, he was calm again. He told her he’d pull into the diner and she could ask for directions. She was confused, uneasy. But he was back to normal.\n\nWhen they finally got to the cabin, they—well, they did exactly what you’d expect two lovers on the run to do. “It wasn’t awkward,” she says, looking back. “That was probably the best part of our relationship, honestly.” Then they fell asleep in each other’s arms.\n\nR. Fresson\n\nWhen Toby woke up, it took her a second to remember where she was and what they’d done. She’d brought a mandolin, and Manard played her “Brown Eyed Girl.” He bought her a box of chocolates (using her cash) and they spent hours in the cabin, holding each other and talking. It was the best Valentine’s Day she’d ever had.\n\nManard was, she says, very romantic. He’d fill the tub with bubbles, light candles around the room, then tell her to take a bath and relax. Every day, when she got dressed, he complimented her. “Wow,” he’d say. “That outfit looks so nice!” When she cooked dinner, he would tell her how great it was, how she was the best cook in the world, how he’d never had fried chicken that good.\n\nThey’d planned to lay low for a few weeks, but Manard wanted to go out. There were so many things he wanted to see, so many foods he hadn’t had in 10 years. So nearly every day, they went somewhere and did something.\n\nShe’d wanted to take some of her dogs with them, but he’d told her they couldn’t, and she missed having a pet. One day they went to a pet store. He said he wanted to buy her a parakeet. She liked a tiny yellow one she saw, but he said he was getting her a blue one instead.\n\n“I’m buying this parakeet, not you,” she remembers him saying. “Don’t think you can tell me what to do. I’m not your fucking husband.”\n\nAs the dark mountain sky skidded past and they teetered near cliffs, Toby wondered for the first time how she was going to get out of all this.\n\nShe left the store and waited by the truck. He gave her the blue parakeet and told her he wanted to name it Lynyrd, after Lynyrd Skynyrd, because the band sang the song “Free Bird”—and that’s what he was, a free bird.\n\nShe said she didn’t like that name.\n\n“You’re not naming this bird,” he told her. “I’m naming it. Its name is Lynyrd.”\n\nShe stuck her finger in the cage, and the bird bit her.\n\nOn their fourth or fifth day, they went to Nashville and saw the movie Walk the Line, about Johnny Cash’s pursuit of and eventual marriage to then-married June Carter.\n\n“John just loved it,” Toby says. “He loved Johnny Cash; he loved all the songs and the music in it. And he’d say, ‘That movie’s about us. I never thought I could have you, and look what I’ve got.’ ”\n\nThey went to a guitar store, where Manard went down the row, trying out guitar after guitar. He asked to play one in a glass case, priced at $10,000. She says he was “in heaven,” and she loved watching him play.\n\nThat day for lunch they went to a McDonald’s drive-through. She had her computer with her, and opened it up while they were in line. McDonald’s had Wi‑Fi, and when her browser loaded, she saw a headline that said something like “Dog Lady Implicated in Escape.”\n\nShe screamed.\n\n“You said that they’d think you manipulated me!” She pointed at her screen. “Look at this! I’m in trouble!”\n\nHe slammed the laptop shut. This, he told her, was why they hadn’t turned on the TV in the cabin.\n\nHe told her they weren’t going to get caught. And if they did, the authorities would blame him. It’s not like she would end up in prison or anything. This calmed her, but she wasn’t hungry anymore.\n\nOne evening, Manard said he’d make her a fire in the fireplace back at the cabin and they could sleep next to the glowing flames. “Wouldn’t that be romantic?” he said.\n\nBut by the time they got back to the area, it was late and there was no place to buy firewood.\n\n“He got so mad,” Toby says. “Like the whole world was against him having a fire that night.”\n\nSnow was falling, and as they drove along the winding mountain roads, Manard jerked the wheel back and forth, causing the truck to slide and fishtail.\n\n“I can’t believe we can’t find any fucking firewood,” she remembers him saying. “I’m just going to drive this truck off of a cliff.”\n\nAs the dark mountain sky skidded past and they teetered near cliffs, Toby wondered for the first time how she was going to get out of all this.\n\nOn their 12th day, they woke up, put on wigs, and drove a few hours to Chattanooga. Manard had never been to an IMAX theater, and a mall there had one. He’d wanted to see a documentary about sharks. But when they got to the theater, they realized that Chattanooga is in a different time zone, and the shark movie had already started. They went to see a movie about lions instead.\n\nAt the concession stand, they noticed a woman buying snacks for a group of kids, and Manard offered to help her carry the food into the theater. When he sat down, he wondered aloud what the woman would think if she knew an escaped convict was carrying snacks for her kids. Toby loved Manard, but by now she was constantly trying to gauge his mood. She was relieved that he liked the lion movie.\n\nAfterward, they went to a barbecue restaurant—and he got upset when he stained his white shirt. Then he wanted to see the snake exhibit at the zoo. But by the time they found the zoo, it was closed. “Then he was mad because he couldn’t see this big snake exhibit,” Toby says.\n\nThey went to Sears so he could buy a GPS—he blamed her for not being able to find the zoo. She went to use the restroom, and when she came out, he had disappeared. She looked around the store, but couldn’t find him anywhere. She began to panic. She was all alone. No phone. No money. Then he jumped out from behind a display and scared her.\n\n“He thought it was so funny,” she says. “I didn’t think it was funny at all.”\n\nLeaving the mall, they walked by two U.S. marshals without realizing it.\n\nIt was getting dark as they cruised down the interstate. Toby was staring out the window, thinking about the mess she’d gotten herself into, when she saw an incredibly bright light in the distance. So bright that it looked like daylight. She thought there must be construction ahead.\n\nAs they got closer, she saw traffic backed up along the service road and a sideways police car blocking the ramp.\n\n“Toby,” Manard said. “This is for us.”\n\nShe turned to look at him.\n\n“What’s for us?”\n\nBefore he could respond, she understood. Through the windshield, she could see what looked like 50 police cars. She remembers thinking, Who do they think we are that they need 50 police cars?\n\n“What do you want me to do, baby?” Manard asked.\n\n“Well,” she said. “If they turn on their lights and tell you to pull over, you have to pull over. That’s the law!”\n\nHe told her he would. But then a police car came from behind and swerved in front of them, and Manard got angry.\n\n“They’re trying to kill us,” she remembers him saying.\n\nHe told her he’d drive until they ran out of gas, then he floored it. She looked at the gas gauge and saw that they had three-quarters of a tank. He was weaving around other cars, driving on the shoulder. Toby watched 18-wheelers fly by, inches from her face.\n\nAt one point, Manard pulled off the highway and drove across the median, dodging pine trees and bushes and shrubs as the truck bounced along. They popped back out on the other side of the highway, now headed in the opposite direction.\n\nThough they were going more than 100 miles an hour, Toby felt like the world was moving in slow motion. And she couldn’t hear a thing. Not sirens. Not squealing tires. Not Manard. It was just cars and trees and flashing lights slowly passing by.\n\nManard was driving on the shoulder again, then through the grass alongside the highway. When he pulled back onto the pavement, the tires locked up and he lost control of the truck. They turned and sped straight toward a tree. As she saw the tree approaching, Toby prayed that God would let her die in the wreck.\n\n“I wanted to be done,” she says.\n\nThen they hit the tree.\n\nSuddenly, she could hear again. Manard was asking her over and over, “Are you okay?” She had shards of glass in her hair and cuts on her head. She couldn’t get enough air to speak. Steam was pouring out of the hood of the truck.\n\nManard told her he didn’t want to leave her, but that if he didn’t get out of the truck, the police would start shooting. She remembers seeing him get out with his hands up. Then a man with what she recalls as “a black machine gun” started yelling at her to get out of the vehicle.\n\nShe tried to explain that her seat belt was stuck and that her door was caved in, but she couldn’t catch her breath to talk. She remembers the officer grabbing her, pulling her out through the window, and throwing her on the ground. Then she had a gun to the back of her head as she was handcuffed.\n\nWhen she looked up, she saw Manard coming around the back of the pickup truck, handcuffed and dragging several officers.\n\n“Are you okay, baby?” he shouted through the chaos. “Are you okay?”\n\nShe said she was.\n\nDespite Manard’s promises that she wouldn’t get in trouble, Toby was charged with aiding and abetting aggravated escape, taking contraband into a prison, and providing firearms to a felon. She was sentenced to 27 months. She later learned that authorities had tracked them to the cabin because Toby had used that address for the paperwork for the truck.\n\n“It turns out, I’m not a good criminal,” Toby says.\n\nHer first endeavor into lawbreaking divided her family. For nearly two weeks, they’d feared the worst. Toby’s father, who had already been sick, died eight weeks after her arrest. Her mother and some of her siblings believed Toby’s felonious behavior and subsequent arrest hastened his death. But her mother loved her unconditionally, and came to visit her in prison almost every week. Toby stayed in contact with her two brothers, but she never reestablished a relationship with her four sisters. Their family had always been private. Having their lives exposed this way was embarrassing and painful. Her sons refused to speak to her. Her husband filed for divorce, and it was finalized the day before she went to prison.\n\nIn an email, Toby’s ex-husband, Pat Young, said he doesn’t remember many of the incidents Toby describes from their marriage, or remembers them differently. But he said he never tried to squash her dreams. Even though he wasn’t a fan of the dog program, for instance, he’d helped her convert the barn into a kennel. “She was very accustomed to doing what she wanted to do,” he said, adding that her crime created ripples of suffering for their family. “It affected me physically, mentally, and monetarily.” And it was especially hard on their sons, “who had to say, ‘Yeah, that’s my mom.’ ”\n\nYoung is remarried now; he and his wife like to play golf together. Of Toby, he said: “She is of no consequence to me.”\n\nR. Fresson\n\nToby knew the men’s prison in Lansing was violent. Women’s prison, she learned, wasn’t like that. There were rivalries and gossip—“high-school drama on steroids,” she says—but prison is also where she formed the strongest friendships of her life. For the first time, she felt like the people around her would do anything to help her. And with no responsibilities, she had time to think about all the things she’d been avoiding her whole life.\n\nManard got 10 years added to his sentence. He wasn’t supposed to communicate with Toby, but he figured out where she was and wrote to other women there with notes to give to her. He sent her drawings and song lyrics and letters describing their love.\n\nBut the more she talked with her new friends in prison, and the more she reflected on everything that had led up to the escape, the more those letters from Manard began to seem a little immature. He would say things like “I’m your knight in shining armor and you’re trapped in this tower and I wish I could ride in on my horse and rescue you.”\n\n“I got that and I thought, This is so not realistic,” she says. “I just decided I have to be done with this.” It was like she was slowly waking up from a dream.\n\nWhen she got out, she moved in with her mother, but everyone in Kansas City knew what she had done, and she felt uncomfortable in public. She found a web-design job in Boston, and decided to move. But she returned to Kansas City several months later, on Christmas Eve 2008.\n\nToby’s younger son had been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. During most of the treatment, Toby gave her sons space. But as her younger son’s condition worsened, she decided to go to the hospital to see him.\n\n“I can’t tell you why I did what I did,” Toby told him. “I haven’t figured it out yet myself. But I want you to know I’ve never stopped loving you.”\n\nHe looked at her and said he knew that.\n\nShe asked to give him a hug.\n\nHe said no.\n\nShe asked if she could come back and see him again.\n\nHe said no.\n\nShe came back anyway, two weeks later. He was in a coma. She touched his face and held his hand and told him he’d fought long enough, and that it was okay for him to go. Then she kissed him and left. He died soon after.\n\nSix months later, in October 2009, Toby got married again, in a simple courthouse ceremony. Her husband’s name is Chris, and he makes her feel safe and supported. He didn’t balk when he first learned her story. He even encouraged her to reach back out to John Manard. Toby and Manard started exchanging letters and talking on the phone. Toby sent him a Christmas basket. Then Toby and Chris went to visit him in prison.\n\n“It was so good for all three of us,” she says.\n\nToby and Manard haven’t communicated in a few years now, and attempts to reach him for this story were unsuccessful. But in a letter he wrote to The Kansas City Star in 2018, he said he’d loved Toby. “Why did I stay with her once I was out if I was just manipulating? I NEVER manipulated her in the least!” he wrote. “I loved Toby with all that I was.”\n\nThese days, Toby is trying to help other women. She’s made workbooks to help women in prison process their feelings and circumstances, to break the destructive cycles that put them behind bars.\n\nShe’s also started telling her own story in public. She’s given just a handful of speeches, but each time she’s been met with a line of women coming up to her afterward, confessing their own secret desire to escape. Her story resonates, she says, because so many women wonder if they wouldn’t do the same thing. They feel pressure to smile and pretend their life is fine, even when trapped in a bad relationship or a bad job or any number of circumstances that seem beyond their control. Toby thinks these women are inspired by her not only because she had the guts to leave, but also because she tells her story without shame.\n\nToby is still a rule follower. She always wears her seat belt. She’s always on time. She says she “freaks out” if Chris turns the car around in someone else’s driveway. She certainly never wants to get arrested again. But she says she’s come to realize that some rules—like keeping a redeemable person locked up for life—aren’t just.\n\nSometimes she’s asked if she regrets what she did: leaving her family, helping a felon escape, living on the run for two weeks. She always says regrets are a waste of time.\n\n“You can’t change the past,” she says. “I like the person I am today, and I wouldn’t be the person I am today if I hadn’t gone through all that.”\n\nWould she do it over again?\n\nShe lets out a sweet, rueful laugh.\n\n“No way.”",

        "title": "Why DOGE Could Actually Increase the Deficit",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk has promised he would eliminate the nearly $2 trillion budget deficit in year one. Last night on Fox, he predicted he would get halfway there by the end of May. His critics have insisted that his goal is unrealistic, and that he won’t accomplish nearly as much deficit reduction as he claims.\n\nThe critics are understating the case. DOGE won’t just fall short of Musk’s deficit-reduction goals. It will, in all probability, increase the deficit. Probably by a lot.\n\nBegin on the savings side. Despite wreaking massive havoc, Musk has accomplished little in terms of saving money for the government. Many of the impressive-sounding budget savings DOGE has posted, in a gesture of putative transparency, have turned out to be fake. And when the people in charge of the enterprise are relying on comical errors, such as taking credit for programs eliminated years ago and confusing million with billion, one should rightly question their basic competence.\n\nBudget experts have had trouble verifying the actual savings, but they appear to be below the level of a rounding error. Jessica Riedl, a budget expert at the Manhattan Institute, recently estimated the savings so far at about $2 billion, or one-tenth of 1 percent of Musk’s original goal. Prediction markets, which less than two months ago expected DOGE to cut $300 billion in spending in the first year, are even more pessimistic than Riedl: They now expect a grand total of $1 billion in savings.\n\nDonald Moynihan: The DOGE project will backfire\n\nBut those are just gross savings. Some of Musk’s haphazard cuts will produce tiny savings in terms of salary while forfeiting much larger ones down the road, costing the government money. One small example: Musk fired the technician who had been servicing the HVAC systems at a Veterans Affairs complex in Illinois. You can save money on upkeep in the short run, but eventually, the systems will break, and replacing them will cost a lot more money (unless DOGE is willing to let the government’s physical assets deteriorate to worthlessness).\n\nThe largest cost, by far, will come from Musk’s meddling with the IRS. DOGE has moved to fire nearly 20,000 employees in the agency, kneecapping the government’s ability to collect taxes. Worse, by advertising the change, it has alerted tax cheats that they face precious little chance of an audit. The IRS released a preliminary survey showing that it expects revenue to fall 10 percent, or $500 billion, short of expected levels. That would obviously be many, many times larger than the projected savings.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that the revenue shortfall will be less than $500 billion, or that the ultimate budget savings will be higher than $1 billion to $2 billion. But the prospect that the effect will net out a savings for the government is almost nil. Critics have been quibbling with the level of alleged fiscal savings when they should have been questioning the sign—whether it is a plus or a minus for the size of the deficit. “Unequivocally, they have the sign wrong,” Natasha Sarin, of the Budget Lab at Yale, told me. “The question is, how badly off are they?”\n\nThe failure of the enterprise was preordained. There isn’t anything close to $1 trillion in waste, fraud, and abuse in the budget, despite Musk’s repeated statements to the contrary. (“The government is not efficient, and there is a lot of waste and fraud, so we feel confident that a 15 percent reduction can be done without affecting any of the critical government services,” he said last night on Fox News.) What’s more, political constraints—Trump’s stated refusal to touch Social Security checks or Medicare, and his party’s proposal to increase military spending by $150 billion over the next four years—leave Musk concentrating on a sliver of the budget. Spending on programs other than social insurance and debt payments amounts to 26 percent of the budget, and almost half of that (12 percent) is defense. Firing tens of thousands of employees in departments that have a huge area of responsibility, yet account for a small share of the budget, is how Musk is managing to simultaneously incapacitate the government’s functionality in key areas without improving the government’s fiscal position.\n\nJonathan Chait: Paranoia is winning\n\nMusk has repeatedly endorsed various conspiracy theories about the federal budget, and seems to believe it contains dark secrets that he can unravel. He has previously claimed that the American left would essentially disappear without the support of disguised payments from the government. More recently, he has begun claiming that the Democrats use systematic payments of fraudulent benefits to attract undocumented immigrants to cast illegal votes to keep them in power. (“By using entitlements fraud, the Democrats have been able to attract and retain vast numbers of illegal immigrants.”)\n\nBecause these schemes exist entirely in Musk’s fevered imagination, he is not going to save much money by ferreting them out. But this raises the question of whether he is really trying to save money at all, or whether he sees the deficit as a pretext to unravel various leftist schemes hidden in the wiring of the federal budget.\n\nWhatever he is attempting to do, though, we can be fairly sure that a smaller deficit is not going to be the result.",

        "title": "Why American Soldiers Are in Lithuania",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "On Tuesday, four U.S. soldiers on a training exercise in Lithuania lost communication with their unit. They have not been seen since. In Vilnius, where I am now, news of their disappearance—and reports that they have died—spread at a remarkably unhurried pace, given how easily a headline like “Four U.S. Soldiers Missing on the Belarusian Border” could raise the curtain on a world war. Yesterday, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the Americans were dead, but backtracked and now says they are missing. The Lithuanian defense minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, announced that the soldiers’ vehicle had been found in a remote location and that “specialized machinery” would be needed to reach it. A note of grief suggested that the soldiers are unlikely to be alive.\n\nThe U.S. Army says the soldiers were in an M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle, which weighs about 20 times as much as a Tesla Cybertruck and is designed to pick up and drag tanks. A Lithuanian who has trained in the marshy area where the exercise was conducted told me that it is easy to get a heavy vehicle stuck there, or even to get stuck on foot. Once a vehicle starts sinking into the mud, it can keep sinking until submerged. He said that under those conditions, even if you can exit the vehicle, it is “nearly impossible” to get out of the area. A soldier laden with heavy gear could be literally bogged down and sucked into the mud.\n\nSo far no one has suggested that the deaths are the result of enemy action—that is to say, Belarusian or Russian action—except in the sense that Americans are in Lithuania in the first place to deter a Russian attack. (Belarus is by now Russia’s wholly owned subsidiary.) Even an accidental death of a soldier abroad raises questions about the purpose and value of his deployment. Roughly 1,000 Americans are now based in Lithuania near the border at Pabradė, in rotations that began in 2019 and got more serious after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. A new rotation just arrived. Germany, which committed just last week to investing 1 trillion euros in its military over the next several years, also has soldiers in Lithuania, and is expected to increase their numbers to more than 5,000. In the Old Town of Vilnius, I met German soldiers in uniform, sipping cappuccinos at a tourist café, and this morning a Luftwaffe Bombardier business jet was parking at the Vilnius airport.\n\nEarlier this week, the Lithuanian foreign minister visited Washington, D.C., to express her country’s eagerness for more Americans. Already a large number of nonmilitary NATO personnel have arrived in all three Baltic capitals and turned them into battlegrounds of espionage and diplomacy, resembling Berlin or Vienna during the Cold War. The Trump administration sometimes suggests that it is tired of basing troops in countries too cheap or feeble to provide for their own defense, as Germany was for several decades. By spending heavily and preparing its citizenry for possible war, Lithuania offers itself as an alternative. “We’re courting the Germans, but we’re looking at the Americans on the side,” a Lithuanian defense analyst told me. “The message is that if you decide to take soldiers out of Germany, don’t send them back to the United States. Bring them to Lithuania.”\n\nDavid Frum: At least now we know the truth\n\nThe likely accidental deaths of these four soldiers will not by themselves stop plans or requests for redeployment. And they shouldn’t: The Baltic states are a rare case where both Trump logic and Biden logic dictate that the United States should boost its support, because the Baltics are morally and materially contributing to American power. Politicians in these countries have quietly expressed revulsion at President Donald Trump’s apparent friendliness with Vladimir Putin and willingness to make sweetheart deals at the expense of Ukraine. But Trump has not yet suggested that he thinks the Baltics suffer from the same alleged flaws as Ukraine (corruption, ingratitude), or that Russia has some sort of natural proprietary role over them. In the same Oval Office meeting where he and Vice President J. D. Vance upbraided Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asserted that he is “committed” to the Baltics.\n\nBut the Armageddon-level stakes of unrest in the region should make anyone uneasy about mishaps. There is little incentive for Russia to kill or snatch U.S. soldiers: A Russian or Belarusian attack on NATO in Lithuania would certainly mean reprisals or worse against Russia, and the escalation would proceed in predictable fashion, until a bad end for Russia at best, and for humanity at worst. The worry, however, is that when you have U.S. soldiers rolling around in armored vehicles on one side of a border, and enemy soldiers doing the same on the other side, even the most innocent errors are freighted with potential geostrategic significance. Ordinary tragedies run small risks of turning into bigger ones, and in unusual situations like this—in which soldiers are mysteriously unaccounted for, days after their disappearance—conspiracies flourish.\n\nYesterday, a reporter asked Trump whether he had been briefed on the soldiers’ disappearance. He said he had not. So far in Europe, he has managed to strong-arm Germany and others into meeting defense-spending targets that they had ignored after less effectual browbeating by previous U.S. administrations. That was a success. A liability of this brash style—saying to other countries, including friendly ones, You’re on your own, suckers—is that when he has to tell his own people that American soldiers are dead in a faraway land, even his most reasonable explanations are bound to sound phony, and his commitment to the mission questionable. This mission is worthwhile, and it will be interesting to hear him explain, if the soldiers are indeed dead, why they have not died in vain.",

The jacked and tatted YouTuber turned boxer flirts with the camera as he shoots promos for, in a meta twist, the show you’re already watching. (The money is fake.) Jake and his older brother, Logan, a YouTuber turned pro wrestler, are the stars and executive producers of the cocksure Max series chronicling their family’s exploits. “Like if the Kardashians were combat fighters—that’s really what we have here,” is how Jake puts it during a pitch meeting. Against a backdrop of podcasts, private jets, McMansions, and shameless shilling (body spray and energy drinks), the brothers steamroll their way through daily life.\n\nThe series is a slick attempt by two giants of the so-called manosphere—the loose network of podcasts and YouTube channels by, for, and about testosterone-laced males—to conquer the cultural mainstream. And yet, in setting out to build their macho fantasy, the Pauls may have also revealed the manosphere’s intellectual limits. Paul American shows Jake, 28, and Logan, 29, discovering that a crucial part of a hetero male’s existence is learning to live with his female equal.\n\nLogan’s fiancée is the Danish supermodel Nina Agdal, and Jake recently proposed to Jutta Leerdam, a Dutch Olympic speed skater. In capturing their relationship dynamics on camera, the show demonstrates that not even the most successful “alpha male” self-promoters can live in a world entirely of their own making. So much of today’s manosphere revolves around the repellent misogyny of influencers such as Andrew Tate, but the first four episodes of Paul American may unwittingly leave viewers with the idea that having a strong, freethinking woman in your life is the best thing that can happen to you.\n\nThe Pauls, who have 150 million online followers across all their platforms, have spent the bulk of their lives on a never-ending quest for virality. Last year, Donald Trump was a guest on Logan’s podcast, Impaulsive—months before Trump went on Joe Rogan’s and Theo Von’s shows—and both brothers attended the president’s inauguration. The internet-culture writer Taylor Lorenz, who has chronicled the Pauls’ rise to fame, told me that a decade ago, they seemed like “silly, young frat-bro-type guys” but that they have since been “radicalized to the right” and embraced by “the Trump movement.” The first episode of the Max show contains a clip from last year in which the president hands Logan an autographed red TRUMP hat.\n\nMost of the time, though, the politics are merely implicit: The Pauls come off as content creators first, athletes second, ideologues a distant third. Jake is a new boxer who last fall fought Mike Tyson, a former champ now in his late 50s; Logan is beholden to the scripted outcomes of World Wrestling Entertainment. But those gigs feel more like side hustles, even if their reality show would like you to believe otherwise. The Pauls are the heirs to MTV’s Jackass, and they built their influence empire by filming their antics for their YouTube channels. One such stunt was Logan setting a mattress ablaze and chucking it into a swimming pool; more disturbing was his infamous journey into Japan’s “suicide forest,” in which he filmed a dead body and received widespread condemnation.\n\nLike Trump, though, the Pauls have muscled through every controversy—bravado they seem to have inherited from their father, Greg. “Cancel culture can suck my ass,” Greg tells the camera, while flashing the middle finger with both hands.\n\nAs children of divorce, the brothers sometimes tiptoe around their short-fused father. Jake occasionally speaks of unspecified traumas. Logan is more direct: “Yeah, man, my dad was physical with us.” (“I think I was a great dad,” Greg responds in the next clip.) In one episode, during a family meeting, Logan refers to his dad as a liability for the show; Greg, incensed, tells his son to “shut the fuck up” and “jokes” about punching him in the face. Some of these moments are uncomfortable, while others feel like pro-wrestling kayfabe. (“We’re gonna have to manufacture some drama for sure,” Logan tells Jake after their show is green-lit.)\n\nHelen Lewis: How Joe Rogan remade Austin\n\nTheir mother, Pam, is generally portrayed in a more sympathetic light but can seem overwhelmed by her sons’ celebrity. “Why would they listen to me?” Pam asks at one point. “They’re making lots more money than I ever made. What am I gonna do?” Still, she never doubted that her boys’ natural athleticism would lead them to lives of distinction; she once believed that Jake, for example, would go into the NFL or become a Navy SEAL. Greg, in contrast, scoffed that if his sons couldn’t become mainstream entertainers, they’d end up doing porn. The sons still act as if they crave his approval.\n\nIn this absence of model parenting, Jake and Logan’s significant others, Jutta and Nina, come to resemble surrogate moms. Each woman keeps her respective Paul in check, even challenges him. In one memorable scene, aboard a private jet, Jutta implores Jake to be his “real” self. “Remember how that was?” she asks pointedly. She’s the most blunt family member at the aforementioned meeting. She won’t uproot her life—she lives and trains in the Netherlands, while he does so in Puerto Rico—and steadfastly refuses to act as Jake’s arm candy. And Jake is visibly his best self around her.\n\nEven the distinctly conservative world of the Pauls has to make room for women’s agency. “The trad wife is not the only model of right-wing femininity,” the feminist writer Jill Filipovic told me. Each brother’s partner telegraphs that she’d be just fine if she had never ventured into the Paul mediaverse.\n\nNina, a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, had previously made cameos in fast-food commercials and on HBO’s bro-fantasy comedy Entourage, but, it seems, she had no plan to become a reality-TV star. In a poignant scene, Nina talks about the cyberbullying and online sexual harassment she’s received from one of Logan’s rivals, an experience that seems to have both shaken and awakened her. The season turns on Nina’s becoming pregnant with her and Logan’s first child—and her ambivalence over turning their baby into content, after her experience of online abuse. He wanted a boy, but Nina’s carrying a girl. In a moment of reflection, Logan admits, “It almost felt maybe like life karma for the way I’ve treated women.”\n\nAt times, Paul American reminds me of The Osbournes—the classic MTV reality series about how fame and fortune unbalance a family—except with blond 20-somethings at the center, instead of an aging British heavy-metal god. That show, from the early 2000s, was fundamentally wholesome; the members of the Osbourne family all appeared to love one another despite profanity flying around the house all day. If there’s any comparably wholesome side to Paul American, it’s that even two man-children can stumble into understanding how their own self-aggrandizement affects the women around them.",

        "content": "The demonstration in London was like so many others in the past year and a half. A swell of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, tens of thousands of them, banged drums and chanted against Israel. Although this march in early October observed the one-year anniversary of the day Hamas militants broke a cease-fire by invading Israeli territory, the marchers paid no heed to the civilians who were murdered or kidnapped.\n\nThe U.K. chapter of the world’s largest human-rights organization, Amnesty International, echoed the marchers’ point of view. The official Amnesty UK account on X promoted a video of an unnamed young female protester clad in a red shirt and a keffiyeh. She peered into the camera and said: “Don’t let anyone tell you this all started on the seventh of October, 2023.”\n\nThe video showed a demonstrator’s placard: It’s been 76 years & 364 days—a reference to events that culminated in the founding of Israel in the late 1940s. The implication: Israel, a member state of the United Nations, has no right to exist. The clip, which Amnesty UK captioned “It didn’t start one year ago,” drew 9.7 million views. Amnesty employees around the world shared it.\n\nThe social-media promotion of this march marked an astonishing shift for one of the world’s most prominent human-rights organizations. Amnesty’s handbook declares that it is “independent of any government, political ideology, economic interest or religion. It does not support or oppose any government or political system, nor does it necessarily support the views of the victims whose rights it seeks to protect.”\n\nAmnesty’s goal was to serve as an advocate for victims and prisoners of conscience, and to stand apart from the polarized politics of the Cold War. The same ethos influenced the founders of Human Rights Watch and Doctors Without Borders. As the latter group proclaims on its website: “We are independent, impartial, and neutral.”\n\nMore recently, though, human-rights leaders have grown accustomed to looking at the complicated stew of politics and culture in Israel and Palestine and blaming Israel foremost. As the cultural and political left has come to dominate the human-rights community, young staffers with passionate ideological commitments have helped rewrite the agendas of the best-known organizations. Critical theories of social justice, built on binaries that categorize Palestinians as oppressed and Israel as the oppressor, now dominate many conversations about the Jewish state, which a constellation of groups casts as uniquely illegitimate—a regressive, racist ethnic “Western” state in an Arab sea.\n\nDara Horn: Why the most educated people in America fall for anti-Semitic lies\n\nRasha Khoury, the president of the board of Doctors Without Borders USA and a surgeon who has worked courageously in war zones, might be seen as the embodiment of this new tendency in the human-rights establishment. She was born in the occupied Palestinian territories. A month after the Hamas attack and the beginning of the Israeli counterattack, she posted an essay on the organization’s digital bulletin board, known as the Souk, the Arabic word for “market.” “We must decolonize our minds,” she wrote. “The mainstream discourse around the unhinged bombardment and massacre of Palestinians in Gaza by Israeli forces for the last 33 days continues to affirm the colonizer’s world view, one rooted in white supremacist logic.”\n\nNot long after October 7, Khoury was among the co-authors of “Violence in Palestine Demands Immediate Resolution of Its Settler Colonial Root Causes”—an article in the journal BMJ Global Health that, subsequent commentators argued, ignored Hamas’s role in triggering the Israeli invasion and incorrectly blamed the Jewish state for a deadly missile strike. In a follow-up article, Khoury and her co-authors responded to the criticism with scorn. “Demands for ‘corrections,’” they declared, “are almost always demands to acquiesce to Israeli state propaganda.”\n\nIn a similar spirit, Doctors Without Borders seemed to minimize the egregiousness of the Hamas attack from the start, describing it on X that very day as “the escalation between Israel and Gaza.” Other human-rights groups have more forthrightly condemned the Hamas offensive but primarily faulted the Jewish state for the underlying conflict. On the day of the attack, Amnesty’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard, posted on X that she was dismayed by the mounting Palestinian and Israeli civilian deaths. She also called for addressing “the root causes of these escalating cycles of violence.” Doing so, she went on, “requires upholding international law and ending Israel’s 16-year-long illegal blockade on Gaza, and all other aspects of Israel’s system of apartheid imposed on all Palestinians.”\n\nHuman-rights groups fairly argue that disagreeing with Israel’s actions and policies is not anti-Semitic, but they have become more and more averse even to considering Israel’s side. “There’s clearly a leftist perspective that would like to do away with Israel,” the longtime Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth told me. Roth led the group for decades before stepping down in 2022 and maintained that his former employer did not share this perspective. Some other former employees of the group disagreed. “The trend is to substitute ideology and personal belief for the principles of the human-rights movement,” Danielle Haas, who left her job as a senior editor at Human Rights Watch, told me.\n\nEarlier this year, Amnesty International took the extraordinary step of suspending its Israel chapter, after that chapter criticized a report accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. In an internal email to colleagues in Europe, Amnesty Israel deputy director Yariv Mohar suggested that the broader organization was playing into “a zero-sum victimhood game, as if any attention or acknowledgment to the victimhood of one side comes at the expense of the other.”\n\nMajor human-rights groups’ shift toward overt opposition to Israel has had the unusual effect of sidelining many of Israel’s own activists, who historically are among the sharpest critics of the Israeli government’s behavior in Gaza and the West Bank. These activists—along with many Jewish counterparts around the world—object to the reflexive condemnation of Israel and wrestle with questions they find vexing: How can the country protect itself from Hamas? What would a proportionate, defensible response to October 7 look like?\n\nRoy Yellin is a longtime left-wing human-rights activist in Israel who has worked closely with the big international groups in Europe and the United States over the years. “Human-rights organizations earned their prestige because they described reality as it was,” he said. “But too often now I’ve seen lots of colleagues in the international community who I thought of as partners who are in complete denial about what Hamas did in Israel.”\n\nWithin human-rights organizations, anger toward Israel has been simmering for decades, particularly as the country’s politics have shifted rightward and its settlements have expanded in the West Bank. On October 7, the divide within the human-rights movement over Israel began to seem unbridgeable, in particular to many Jewish employees. That morning, Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters viciously attacked Israel, slaughtering civilians before retreating back into Gaza, where they gathered their armaments and hid in tunnels, using the dense civilian population aboveground as human shields. Hospitals, schools, and universities—all became hiding spots for Hamas militants.\n\nIsrael responded with a relentless, at times brutal, invasion of Gaza, in which many thousands of Palestinian civilians, including children, were killed. This has given rise to a heated debate about whether such actions can be justified. Many critics have argued that Israel, as a democracy that professes to follow modern rules of war, has an obligation to minimize civilian casualties, and they point to abundant evidence that Israel chose to drop bombs on Hamas militants and headquarters even when aware that these sites were crowded with civilians. Even some Israelis have objected to the duration of the war and felt that it was too driven by feelings of rage and revenge. The international human-rights movement has gone further. Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and Doctors Without Borders have all accused Israel of crimes against humanity and acts of genocide. Some human-rights leaders have openly questioned Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state.\n\nOver the past six months, I’ve reviewed internal emails and hundreds of social-media posts by leaders of prominent human-rights organizations. I’ve also spoken with more than two dozen Jewish employees of these groups, nearly all of whom described a pervasive and growing estrangement from the organizations where they had worked, in some cases, for decades. None of these staffers would pass for an apologist for Israel’s right-wing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Their politics are left of center and many are deeply critical of Israel’s invasion and of actions that they categorize as war crimes. But, they said, talk of taking a nuanced view of the conflict drew contempt from colleagues and supervisors.\n\nThese Jewish employees argued internally that Israel had waged a brutal war, but also that Israelis were badly scarred by the slaughter of October 7 and that Hamas had committed terrible war crimes and acts of terrorism. Yet to take these positions was to risk being labeled as a propagandist for a settler-colonialist regime. Many of these employees are particularly galled by the frequent claim that Israel is a white-supremacist state. More than half of Israeli Jews are descendants of those who lived in Arab countries, Iran, and Ethiopia; a great many others have ancestors who were driven from Europe by the Nazis.\n\nA former top executive with a well-known human-rights organization noted the frustration inherent in trying to draw evenhanded distinctions that were once elementary in the human-rights world. “Hamas has an obligation under international law not to use human shields and to distinguish between military and civilian targets,” this person, who asked not to be identified to avoid further alienating former colleagues, said. “But if you bring this up internally, it’s framed as a distraction, an Israeli talking point.”\n\nThe leaders of the world’s most prominent human-rights groups have displayed little appetite for acknowledging the uncertainty and moral murk of the Gaza war. On October 17, 2023, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reported that Israel had bombed the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital and killed close to 500 Palestinians. Amnesty and Doctors Without Borders immediately picked up on that claim: The leaders of the latter group posted about the Israeli “massacre” on their social-media feeds. And Human Rights Watch’s director of Israel and Palestine issues, Omar Shakir, amplified a post blaming Israel for the attack. He added: “Abject horror. THIS MUST END.”\n\nShakir backed off a few hours later, saying that his organization was investigating. And to its credit, Human Rights Watch did so judiciously. A month later, it reported that the explosion likely was caused by a misfired Palestinian missile, which hit a paved area next to a parking lot and not the hospital itself. It also faulted the Gaza Health Ministry for reporting a death toll that is “significantly higher than other estimates, displays an unusually high killed-to-injured ratio, and appears out of proportion with the damage visible on site.” (Unlike Amnesty and Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch has also released a report that researched and documented Hamas’s war crimes on October 7.)\n\nRead: The case for Palestinian pragmatism\n\nTo this day, Doctors Without Borders has not removed its debunked claims of Israeli malfeasance from its social-media feed.\n\nDoug Sandok worked with Doctors Without Borders in Rwanda, Chechnya, and Sri Lanka in the 1990s. He has charted the curdling of the group’s rhetoric regarding Israel. “I went to an organization-wide meeting in November 2023, and the discourse shocked me, all about anti-settler-colonialism and racism,” he told me. “A number of us asked, ‘Is it really a foregone conclusion that Israel has committed genocide?’ It feels like one more institution captured by the ideological left.”\n\nFor Dan Balson, working for Amnesty International was a longtime dream. He and his parents got out of the Soviet Union in 1988, as part of a wave of Jewish émigrés. Amnesty, he told me, played a key role in pressuring Moscow to release families like his. “It was a household name in my world,” Balson, who is 40, said.\n\nHe became Amnesty’s advocacy director for Europe and Central Asia, covering territory that stretched from Russia to Afghanistan to Ukraine. He admired the courage and creativity that his colleagues showed in documenting human-rights abuses. One used a fragment of an exploded shell that killed civilians to track down and publicly identify the armaments manufacturer; another donned a niqab and traveled through a war zone, documenting the crimes of a government and its secret police.\n\nSlowly, however, Balson noticed a harshness creeping in whenever the subject of Israel arose. In particular, when he visited Amnesty’s global headquarters in London, he sensed an antipathy toward Israel and anyone who identified as a Zionist.\n\nOn the morning of October 7, Balson checked and rechecked his messages to see if Israeli friends had been harmed. Then he scrolled the Amnesty International website, which issued a statement that day deploring that “civilians on both sides” were “paying the price of unprecedented escalation in hostilities between Israel and Gaza.” That statement just once referred to Hamas, which controls the government of Gaza, preferring the term “Palestinian armed groups.”\n\nBalson turned to X and saw that his colleague Rasha Abdul-Rahim, then the director of technical services for Amnesty, had claimed that although she was distressed by reports of Palestinian fighters dancing on Israeli bodies, Palestinians had suffered worse for decades. She added:“To be truly anti racist and decolonial is to recognise that resistance against oppression is sometimes ugly.”\n\nThat night Balson wrote his resignation letter. Amnesty International’s time-honored approach, he wrote to his supervisors, was to decode the motivations, anxieties, and limitations of a nation and its leaders, even when those are disagreeable. None of that seemed to apply to Israel. Amnesty’s approach, he wrote, “has shown such disdain for Israelis’ existential fears that it seems deliberately calculated to repel rather than attract and persuade.”\n\nEven Amnesty’s sparing acknowledgment of Hamas’s role on October 7 had proved too pro-Israeli for some staffers, who insisted that Amnesty’s statement was too understanding of Israel. As debate grew within the organization, and some Jewish staffers argued for measured tones, other Amnesty employees complained that such arguments were “triggering” and accused Jewish colleagues of Islamophobia, multiple staffers told me.\n\nI asked Amnesty International USA’s director, Paul O’Brien, about these tensions. He replied that most conversations within Amnesty USA were respectful but “not pain-free.” Might unbridled passions and angry social-media positings, I asked, interfere with Amnesty’s work? “I have seen social-media publications that I wish we had not sent,” he acknowledged.\n\nO’Brien’s critics see his own conduct as at times emblematic of the movement’s growing opposition to Israel’s entire reason for being. In March 2022, he backhandedly endorsed the disestablishment of Israel in its current form. “We are opposed to the idea—and this, I think, is an existential part of the debate—that Israel should be preserved as a state for the Jewish people,” he said at a luncheon of the Woman’s National Democratic Club in Washington, D.C. He subsequently expressed regret for his remarks and said that Amnesty “takes no position on the legitimacy or existence of any state, including Israel.” (Israel’s 2 million Arab citizens vote and are represented in the country’s Parliament and on its supreme court.)\n\nBut making stridently anti-Israel remarks, whether in person or online, is not a barrier to gaining a prominent role at Amnesty. In April 2022, a Palestinian gunman killed three Israeli civilians in Tel Aviv. Rasha Abdel Latif, a human-rights activist in D.C., reposted a social-media statement written in Arabic that stated: “This land is our land … The occupation has no choice but to leave.”\n\nFour days later, Amnesty USA appointed Latif to its board. Two people told me that angry Jewish employees demanded a meeting with O’Brien and management, during which O’Brien conceded that, yes, Latif’s social-media post could be read as anti-Jewish. But he said that she had learned her lesson and that the board would not censure her so as to avoid giving comfort to the organization’s critics. Latif’s critics accused Amnesty of treating her as a victim. “The only reason she was not removed from the board is that the victims of her bias were Jewish,” Balson told me.\n\nWriting inflammatory social-media posts has become common among Amnesty officials. On the first day of 2024, Abdul-Rahim, the former technical-services director, posted on X, “Happy new year to everyone except the #israeli apartheid state.” Even Amnesty USA’s official website features dubious statements. In May, Amnesty put up a collage of footage from its “Solidarity With Gaza” conference, accompanied by music from the hip-hop artist Macklemore. “Who gets the right to defend and who gets the right of resistance has always been about dollars and the color of your pigment, but white supremacy is finally on blast,” Macklemore said in his rap about Israel.\n\nI asked O’Brien about that post, which at a minimum seemed ignorant of Israel’s actual demographics. O’Brien said he was unfamiliar with it (though it had been on Amnesty USA’s site for half a year, even after employees had complained about it to senior managers). I sent him a link, and he replied the next day: “Thanks for flagging that post. We have removed it as it did not follow our internal guidelines.”\n\nThis past fall, on the anniversary of the October 7 attack, an extraordinary anonymous statement purporting to represent more than 40 current and former Doctors Without Borders staffers appeared on the Souk. It angrily protested how the Geneva-based organization, which has 69,000 employees and an annual budget well over $1 billion, tended to characterize the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe statement accused Doctors Without Borders of remaining silent about Hamas’s “ferocious barbarity” and sexual violence and of ignoring Israelis taken hostage, some of whom died in captivity, including infants. “This version” of the organization, the statement declared, “does not represent us. It barely represents itself.”\n\nFrench physicians founded Doctors Without Borders in the aftermath of a civil war and famine in Nigeria. Its charter committed to providing medical care without regard to politics, race, or nationality. But five staffers, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of endangering their jobs, described an environment in which their colleagues refused to entertain any nuance about the Jewish state. In November, for example, Javid Abdelmoneim, the former president of Doctors Without Borders UK, endorsed a full boycott of Israel, writing on X: “Invest no other time on Israel other than to cut it out of your life.”\n\nMichael Goldfarb, a former longtime communications director for Doctors Without Borders, had worked in desolate and dangerous corners of the world. But his patience for his former employer eventually reached an end. He posted last year on the Souk, writing of his frustration with the “blatantly hate filled and, yes, anti-Semitic responses” within the organization to the anonymous Souk statement. “Fear of retaliation, silencing, and ostracism grips many MSF colleagues,” he wrote, using the French abbreviation for Doctors Without Borders, “who nonetheless courageously endorsed the publication of the post.” (Goldfarb declined my request for further comment.)\n\nAs if to underline his statement about organizational intolerance, Doctors Without Borders employees let loose on the Souk, going after Goldfarb and all those who signed the statement. “I leave you with your hatred, your racism and your victimization (We’re used to it!),” one rank-and-file staffer wrote. Another employee, Olivier Falhun, of the press office in Paris, responded to the dissenters, “At the risk of offending your principles-based catechism, I can’t resist sharing with you a self-evident solution … ‘We’ll have to give the land back. It’s as simple as that.’”\n\nGershom Gorenberg: Netanyahu takes desperate measures\n\nThese and similar statements have remained on the organization-wide site for many months. (I sought to talk with senior leaders at Doctors Without Borders USA about this atmosphere and other questions regarding Israel. A press officer, Brienne Prusak, wrote back that “we are respectfully going to decline.”)\n\nThe organization’s one-sided view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict goes beyond incendiary sentiments on message boards and social media. The fact is that the hospitals they worked in were often home to Hamas gunmen and armaments.\n\nIn November 2023, the Israeli army announced plans to root out Hamas operatives that it said were hiding in Al-Shifa Hospital, a major medical facility in Gaza City. A large contingent of Doctors Without Borders staff worked there, and its leaders took offense at the Israeli claim. The president of its Australian chapter, Katrina Penney, told a newspaper that she had “seen no evidence that the hospital buildings or the compounds are being used by Hamas as a military base.”\n\nI asked two Doctors Without Borders employees who had worked in East Jerusalem and Gaza about such claims. These staffers frowned. The presence of Hamas gunmen in that hospital and in others was an open secret. “You knew Hamas was there; I went to meetings where this was made very clear,” the staffer, who asked for anonymity out of a desire to continue to work in the human-rights field, told me. “Doors were hidden. There were units you did not get into, that had armed guards at the door.”\n\nLaws of war require soldiers to act with great care when fighting around hospitals, and none of this testimony would justify Israeli brutality. Likewise, however, humanitarian groups such as Doctors Without Borders claim to observe the principle of bearing witness to abuses—an obligation that includes challenging armed groups such as Hamas that risk civilian lives by using hospitals as bases and hiding spots.\n\nMonths after that Israeli operation at Al-Shifa, Hamas’s subterfuge was exposed—as was the willful ignorance of Doctors Without Borders. A New York Times investigation strongly suggested that Hamas used Al-Shifa for cover and to store weapons. U.S. spy agencies went further, saying that Hamas used Al-Shifa as a command center and that it held hostages there. That would be a war crime.\n\nLast June, Doctors Without Borders accused Israel of killing one of its staff physiotherapists, Fadi Al-Wadiya, as he biked to work. Organization officials portrayed this as a war crime, an innocent family man slaughtered. An official statement said, “There is no justification for this; it is unacceptable.”\n\nDoctors Without Borders posted a photo of Al-Wadiya’s fractured bicycle. Word circulated that he had been a fighter with Islamic Jihad, a radical group that allied with Hamas on October 7. The organization vigorously denied this. Then the Israeli army released photos of Al-Wadiya, who it said was a rocket specialist, wearing an Islamic Jihad uniform. Doctors Without Borders ultimately conceded that it was “deeply concerned by these allegations” and said it would “never knowingly employ” a fighter.\n\nA staffer involved in hiring for Doctors Without Borders spoke of great organizational pressure to expand hiring in Gaza. “We were told not to check backgrounds,” this employee told me, adding that one office in Gaza had two known Hamas militants. “Our Arab staff was greatly concerned because to be in the same room with operatives put all at risk.”\n\nThis staffer paused. “Look, I’m truly not defending Israel; there is a lot in its actions to criticize,” this person said, adding that Doctors Without Borders had been “blindly pro-Palestinian to an extent that was destructive. And if you were Jewish and questioned it, you were just waved off.”\n\nAmid the terrible losses and savage fighting that have marked the war in Gaza, human-rights groups have demonstrated far greater urgency in documenting and denouncing Israel’s conduct than that of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. In December, Amnesty International released its much anticipated and publicized report accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Amnesty, however, has yet to complete a long-promised report examining the Hamas-driven murder and rape of Israeli civilians on October 7. O’Brien said the staff is hard at work on this. “The documentation has been extraordinarily difficult,” he told me. “Investigating sexual violence in an ethical and sensitive manner can take many months.”\n\nAmnesty has moved with far more dispatch to stamp out dissent within its ranks. Amnesty’s Israeli chapter is known for feisty independence, taking on Netanyahu’s government and at times its own international parent group. The Israeli branch has maintained that, although it was not downplaying “the many horrific atrocities made by Israel in Gaza, which, according to the information we have, seems, on the surface, to have crossed the threshold of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing,” it viewed Amnesty’s accusation of genocide as poorly reasoned. The genocide claim, the chapter argued, seemed designed to “support a popular narrative among Amnesty International’s target audience.” The Israeli branch, frustrated with the broader organization’s silence on such questions, also began what it called a “pro-human campaign” to condemn both what it saw as anti-Semitism in some worldwide protests and the Islamophobia inside Israel, and to point out that extremists on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict promote ideologies of annihilation.\n\nRead: The left’s self-defeating Israel obsession\n\nThe campaign announcement angered top Amnesty officials in the United States and Europe. Last May, Erika Guevara-Rosas, the senior director of global research, advocacy, policy, and campaigns, ordered the Israeli chapter to end its campaign. “Given the serious reputational and legitimacy risk, I am asking you to take this document down from all your platforms immediately,” she wrote in an email that I obtained.\n\nThe right-wing Israeli government and its supporters frequently clash with the country’s Amnesty chapter. For their part, Amnesty International leaders view the Israeli branch as rogue and disloyal, and in January, not long after the criticism of the genocide report, they suspended the chapter for two years. Amnesty emails suggest that this could turn into a full expulsion. Tiumalu Lauvale Peter Fa’afiu, the New Zealand–born chair of Amnesty’s international board, wrote to his team that it must decide “whether Amnesty International Israel has a future within the Amnesty Movement.”\n\nThese emails revealed that Amnesty leaders planned in advance to deflect the Israeli chapter’s criticism of their genocide report by accusing it of “endemic anti-Palestinian racism.” A Fa’afiu email underlined the real grievance: The Israeli branch had tried to “publicly discredit Amnesty’s human rights research and positions.”\n\nAfter leaving Amnesty, Dan Balson has found himself adrift. He has begun, with reluctance and disappointment, to wonder about the assumptions of so many in the human-rights movement. “Within Amnesty, the phrase ‘Criticism of Israeli policy is not anti-Semitism’ has taken on a kind of mystical significance,” he told me. “It is repeated frequently and forcefully, in private and in public. Amnesty’s leadership appears to believe that, if said with the proper zeal and elocution, the phrase will magically ward off deeper scrutiny.”\n\nYellin, the left-wing Israeli activist who has collaborated with major international groups, is even more disillusioned. “They think if they just scream ‘genocide’ and ‘apartheid,’ maybe we will go back to Europe.”\n\nHe exhaled. “Some days I feel like I’ve just been a useful idiot.”",

        "title": "The Truth About Trump’s Greenland Campaign",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has made his fixation on Greenland abundantly clear—enough so to unnerve many of the people who live there. “I think Greenland is going to be something that maybe is in our future,” he told reporters this week, once again teasing the notion of annexation. Vice President J. D. Vance is traveling there today, after what he called the “excitement” around his wife’s plan to attend a famous dogsledding race. As part of the trip, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright were scheduled to visit a U.S. military base; Greenland’s prime minister, Mute B. Egede, called the visit a “provocation.” Now dogsledding is out, and the entire delegation will together travel to the base.\n\nTheir aim, the vice president said in a video on X, is to check up on Greenland’s security, because unnamed other countries could “use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States.” And these are real concerns for the United States, rooted in climate change: As polar ice melts away, superpowers are vying for newly open shipping routes in the Arctic Ocean and largely unexplored mineral and fossil-fuel reserves. Arctic warming could pose a direct threat to America’s security interests too: Alaska could have new vulnerabilities to both China and Russia; changes in ocean salinity and temperature might interfere with submarine detection systems; the extremes of climate change, including permafrost thaw in Russia, could drive economic instability, social unrest, and territorial claims.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the U.S. military and NATO had both started to treat global warming in the Arctic as a matter of real military concern. Whether that will continue under Trump is an open question. Even as the president has tried to erase U.S.-government action on climate change, when he talks about Greenland, he’s tacitly acknowledging that rising temperatures are rapidly changing that part of the world—and U.S. interests there.\n\n“This is a threat environment we haven’t encountered in living history,” Marisol Maddox, a climate-security specialist at Dartmouth’s Institute of Arctic Studies, told me. For decades, the world’s response to climate change has been one of prevention, driven by scientists and diplomats. The Trump administration is openly rejecting that approach. But as the more dramatic impacts of climate change become reality, even a president who wants to ignore its risks may have no choice in the matter.\n\nIn recent years, the world’s largest military apparatuses—the U.S. Department of Defense and NATO—have added climate change to their war games. Both DOD and NATO have started regularly assessing how climate risks could affect both military and civilian security, and NATO opened the Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence in Montreal. In the U.S., national intelligence agencies “are thinking about strategic surprise” from climate change, Julie Pullen, a climate scientist who’s part of a congressionally mandated advisory group of climate-security experts, told me. Just as, for instance, the Defense Intelligence Agency might have to weigh the possibility that Iran might one day have nuclear weapons, intelligence officials should consider the nonzero chance of the Eastern Seaboard going underwater, she said.\n\nA handful of other countries—Germany, Australia, Japan, and several small island states—also have a policy for climate security, and many NATO states refer to such aims in their security agenda. But the U.S. has been leading the world in thinking seriously and systematically about these realities. Although this shift happened during the Biden administration, Sherri Goodman, who served as the deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security, told me that in the U.S., this push had been a nonpartisan effort and that for the military, “it’s all about risk.” She’s seen four-star generals go from treating climate change with skepticism to facing it like any challenge the military must prepare for.\n\nThe second Trump administration doesn’t exactly see it that way. After CNN reported on DOD plans to cut climate programs earlier this month, for instance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth affirmed on X, quite bluntly, that the department “does not do climate change crap.” References to climate change have been fast disappearing from major agency websites—including the entire Department of Defense Climate Resilience Portal. In response to a request for comment, a DOD spokesperson told me that the department “is eliminating climate-change programs and initiatives” and that “climate change is not part of the department’s warfighting mission nor the president’s priorities.”\n\nBut the logic of climate security still holds. As the region’s ice-covered buffer zone opens up, “we need to be very mindful of the changes that are taking place, and posture to respond,” Iris Ferguson, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for Arctic and global resilience, told me. Until now, the world has opted to respond to such changes by trying to reduce emissions through climate diplomacy. But those reductions aren’t happening as climate diplomacy promised. In fact, in October 2024, a United Nations report found that atmospheric carbon dioxide was increasing “faster than any time experienced during human existence.” At some point, the U.S. military might start to consider its own, more direct options for responding.\n\nAssuming that greenhouse-gas emissions keep rising, scientists predict that climate change will have abrupt, irreversible effects on the planet—the only question is when. For instance, they’ve been tracking the potential slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, an ocean-circulation mechanism that regulates global temperatures. If the AMOC eventually collapses, sea levels along parts of the East Coast could rise by up to a meter, and temperatures across Europe could drop dramatically, disrupting the global food supply. (Agriculture in Great Britain, for instance, could be largely wiped out.) Scientists are still debating if and how quickly the AMOC’s collapse might occur, but recently some have begun to warn that it could happen within just a few decades.\n\nIf the world is heading that rapidly toward an irreversible tipping point, “that’s where climate interventions start to make a lot of sense” for the U.S. government, Pullen told me. Sandia National Laboratories, the Albuquerque lab dedicated to national security, is investigating technologies that could slow down or reverse the rise of global temperatures. Scientists and engineers from the lab have, for instance, simulated the effects of releasing several million metric tons of sulfur dioxide from planes circling above the Arctic. Those chemicals would reflect sunlight, casting a cooling shade over the planet’s surface and dropping temperatures over several decades. Eventually, some Arctic sea ice might be restored too. (The Department of Energy, which oversees Sandia, did not comment on whether these efforts would continue in the Trump administration.)\n\nTo date, the scientific community has largely rejected geoengineering as an overly risky gamble. And injecting chemicals into the stratosphere does present serious ethical and governance challenges. This plan is impossible to test at scale before deploying, rendering most consequences both unknown and possibly irreversible. Any kind of responsible management would require unprecedented international cooperation, potentially including a new multinational body to govern geoengineering. As President Trump casts doubt on NATO, that level of global cooperation seems less likely all the time. And if injections stopped (whether because governance or the technology itself failed), many models suggest that the world could plunge into “termination shock”—rapid global heating with consequences potentially worse than if we’d never used this strategy at all.\n\nSandia’s simulations are just that: simulations. But Maddox believes that the U.S. government should continue exploring even the most drastic options. Failing to mitigate climate change increases the odds “that we’ll have to rely on a technology that’s pretty extreme,” she said. “When multiple catastrophic events converge at the same time and public outcry reaches a panic level, the government must be ready with options.”\n\nSo far this term, Trump has acted as if climate change does not matter: He has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, announced plans to reopen the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling, and paused new offshore-wind development and Inflation Reduction Act clean-energy funding. But if the president’s bid for Greenland—or the U.S. military’s quiet cooperation with Canada to boost Arctic defenses—is any indication, the U.S. is weighing its options for a warmer future. “We live in the real world,” Evan Bloom, a global fellow at the Wilson Center’s Polar Institute and former State Department official, told me. “The military and other agencies will continue to take climate change into account, because they have to.” When he hears Trump talk about Greenland, he hears the president speaking about the geopolitics of climate change—“whether he’s willing to call it that or not.”",

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\n\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”",

        "title": "Does moderation actually hurt Democratic candidates?",
        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.\n\nEarlier this month, Thomas Edsall published a column in the New York Times titled, “Even if the Democrats can move to the center, it may not help.” In it, the eminent political analyst argued that “there is evidence that the process of moderation has the potential to result in unintended adverse consequences.”\n\nEdsall was referring to a new working paper from Stanford University political scientist Adam Bonica and two co-authors. As Bonica explained in an interview with the Times, his research points toward “a clear conclusion: There appears to be very little electoral advantage from running to the center in contemporary congressional elections.”\n\nAccording to Bonica, although moderate candidates were a little better at persuading voters to support them, this advantage was tiny and potentially outweighed by moderation’s negative impact on turnout.\n\n“Democrats have achieved their greatest electoral successes precisely in cycles (2008 and 2018) when they did not moderate relative to Republicans,” Bonica told the Times, while “in cycles where Democrats ran more moderate candidates (like 2010 and 2014), their electoral performance was notably weaker.” He also reiterated these claims in a viral Bluesky thread.\n\nThis story was first featured in The Rebuild. Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nAll this has triggered a lively debate about how Democrats should weigh Bonica’s evidence against the many studies showing that moderation is electorally beneficial on net. The election analysis site SplitTicket noted that Bonica’s “finding cuts against everything we’ve modeled.”\n\nBut this debate proceeds from a false premise: Bonica’s data doesn’t actually cut against the idea that moderation is beneficial.\n\nOn the contrary, his study indicates that moderation can significantly increase Democrats’ support with swing voters, especially in high-profile races. He and his co-authors note it is theoretically possible that this benefit is outweighed by moderation’s negative impact on Democratic turnout. But, by their own admission, they possess no strong evidence that such a negative impact exists.\n\nJudging by Bonica’s data, a conservative Democrat probably would have beaten Donald Trump in 2016\n\nThe bulk of Bonica’s paper aims to calculate how candidates’ ideological positioning impacts their electoral performance. The study argues that previous attempts to gauge this relationship have been distorted by a failure to control for voter turnout. As the authors note, a “candidate’s ability to shift overall turnout is limited,” since voter participation is influenced by many factors external to their campaigns. For example, if a state has a high-profile abortion referendum on the ballot, then Democratic candidates in that state could enjoy elevated base turnout, even if their own stances did little to mobilize voters. Meanwhile, Democrats in a state with no such referenda might see lower turnout through no fault of their own.\n\nTo account for this, Bonica and his co-authors look at how ideologically distinct candidates — on the ballot at the same time — performed within the same precincts.\n\nSpecifically, for each race on the ballot, they calculate the “ideological midpoint” — basically, the point on a left-to-right axis that is halfway between the Democratic and Republican candidates’ respective ideological position — and then measure how vote-share changes as this midpoint shifts rightward or leftward.\n\nThe idea here is: When the midpoint lies to the right, the Republican candidate is more conservative than the Democratic candidate is progressive. When the midpoint lies to the left, the opposite is true.\n\nThey find that the farther right this midpoint moves in a given race, the better Democrats do. Now, on its face, this could just mean that Democrats do better when they run against far-right Republicans — the more conservative the GOP candidate in a race is, the farther right the midpoint will be, no matter the ideology of their Democratic opponent. But the study shows that it doesn’t really matter why the ideological midpoint shifts right: Democrats becoming more moderate increases the party’s vote share by about as much as Republican candidates becoming more conservative.\n\nFrom this, they extrapolate that, on average, centrist Democrats (e.g., Sen. Joe Manchin types) enjoy a roughly 0.6 percentage point advantage over mainstream ones (e.g., Sen. Amy Klobuchar types) across all races, when turnout is held constant.\n\nThe Times presented this tiny fraction as evidence that moderation’s benefits might be negligible. And yet, according to Bonica’s study, the impact of ideology on electoral outcomes varies widely by office: In high-profile races — where voters are more likely to receive information about the candidates’ positions — centrists enjoy a bigger advantage over their more left-wing counterparts. In governors’ races, the former outperform the latter by 1.9 percentage points; in presidential and Senate races, they outperform by about 1 point. These are not insignificant margins: Had Hillary Clinton’s share of the vote been 1 point higher in 2016, she likely would have won the presidency.\n\nBy contrast, ideology has almost no impact on state-level races for judicial positions and other minor state-level offices, likely because voters do not pay close attention to candidates’ positions in such races. The negligible impact of ideology in these low-profile races drags down the average benefit of moderation in the paper. That said, moderates’ advantage in House races specifically is barely higher than their average advantage across all offices, at just 0.65 points.\n\nImportantly, all of these figures are measuring conservative Democrats’ advantage over mainstream Democrats. The study implies that the performance gap between conservative Democrats and progressive Democrats would be larger.\n\nBonica’s paper provides little evidence that moderation is bad for turnout\n\nBonica’s case for questioning moderation’s efficacy hinges on a speculative premise: that centrism might do more to demobilize base voters than to persuade swing voters. But his paper does not even attempt to prove this.\n\nThe study does provide evidence for two claims about the relationship between turnout, ideology, and election outcomes:\n\n• When turnout among Democrats goes up — relative to turnout among Republicans — Democrats win more elections. And the benefits of turning out a higher percentage of your voters than the other party did are quite large — far larger than the benefits of moderation.\n\n• Between 2008 and 2022, Democrats tended to see stronger turnout — and better outcomes — when the average ideological midpoint of all House races was more left-wing.\n\nThey illustrate these two points with a pair of charts:\n\nBut I think the evidence here is weaker than Bonica’s Bluesky posts — or Edsall’s write-up in the Times — would lead one to believe.\n\nFor one thing, we are looking at only eight data points — the eight federal election cycles from 2008 through 2022. And not all eight conform to Bonica’s trend lines.\n\nWithin his data set, Democrats suffered their second-worst election loss and turnout showing in 2014. And yet, the ideological midpoint that year was unusually left-wing (only in 2008 and 2018 did the ideological midpoint of House races lie farther to the left).\n\nIn 2016, meanwhile, the ideological midpoint of all House races was more left-wing than it had been in 2012. And yet Democrats saw better turnout during the earlier election cycle.\n\nIndeed, it’s not clear that there is any relationship between ideological positioning and turnout in Bonica’s data. When the Democratic pollster Charlotte Swasey tried to chart out this relationship, using Bonica’s findings for the years 2008 through 2020, she found no clear trend:\n\nCourtesy of Charlotte Swasey.\n\nAnd Bonica’s proposed correlation breaks down even further when one looks directly at changes in Democratic ideology. Remember: Shifts in the ideological midpoint are influenced by both Republican and Democratic positioning. So to isolate the impact of Democratic moderation on turnout, we should really look at how the average Democratic candidate’s ideology changes from year to year, rather than at how the ideological midpoint changes.\n\nSuch figures aren’t reported in Bonica’s paper. But he provided me with the relevant numbers. And several of them cut against the idea that moderation leads to lower turnout:\n\n• Democrats were more moderate in 2008 than in 2014, yet the party saw much better turnout in the former year.\n\n• Democrats were more moderate in 2018 than in 2020, yet the party saw better turnout (relative to the GOP) in 2018.\n\n• Democratic candidates were more moderate in 2012 than in 2016, yet the party had better turnout in 2012.\n\n• Democratic candidates were more moderate in 2018 than in 2022, yet saw better turnout in 2018.\n\n• Democratic candidates were more moderate in 2016 than in 2020, and yet — according to Bonica’s data — the party actually had slightly better turnout (relative to Republicans) the year that Hillary Clinton lost than in the year that Biden won.\n\nIn short, Bonica’s numbers don’t actually show that moderation even systematically correlates with worse Democratic turnout, much less that the former causes the latter. Rather, his data suggests that the Democratic Party has grown increasingly progressive since 2008, and that this leftward drift has had no predictable impact on Democratic turnout from year to year.\n\nAnd there are simpler explanations for why Democrats saw strong turnout in 2008 and 2018, but weak turnout in 2010, 2014, and 2022.\n\nIn 2008, Democrats ran an extraordinarily charismatic, historically significant presidential candidate against a GOP that was presiding over a financial crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, the party that doesn’t hold the presidency almost always has an advantage in midterm elections, in part because their opposition’s base grows complacent with power. This dynamic explains why Democrats saw relatively high turnout in 2018 (when a Republican held the White House) but relatively weak turnout in 2010, 2014, and 2022 (when a Democrat held the presidency).\n\nIn an interview, Bonica told me that he has “tried to make clear” that his proposed trade-off between moderation and turnout is a “potential” one that “hasn’t been causally established.”\n\n“What we do learn from the paper is that the overall gains from moderation are just quite small,” Bonica said.\n\nNevertheless, his findings offer more cause for thinking that moderation increases Democratic vote-share than for thinking that it reduces the party’s turnout.\n\nAnd other research gives us reasons to doubt the latter premise. According to many political scientists and pollsters, very liberal Democrats are the party’s most reliable voters. It is Democrats with more moderate — or heterodox — views who waffle the most about whether to cast a ballot. And these less politically engaged Democrats often resemble swing voters ideologically and demographically. For this reason, the forces that push swing voters to the right — and those that nudge unreliable Democratic voters toward staying home — are sometimes one and the same.\n\nRelated The myth that could cost Democrats the next election\n\nProgressives should not jump to ideologically convenient conclusions on the basis of weak evidence\n\nIt doesn’t necessarily follow that Democrats should move to the right. There are strong substantive arguments for many progressive policies. And the political benefits of moderation in Bonica’s paper aren’t terribly large.\n\nRegardless, it’s more productive to debate how the party should position itself on discrete issues than whether it should “move right” or “move left.” Some policies associated with the left are popular, some associated with the center are not. So, it’s helpful to get specific.\n\nNevertheless, it’s important to be clear-eyed when analyzing the relationship between ideological positioning and electoral outcomes. In progressive circles, empirical claims about the efficacy of moderation are often imbued with moral weight: To say that Democrats would benefit from moderating on any issue is to betray vulnerable minority groups, while denying the efficacy of moderation is to defend those groups.\n\nBut this is misguided. Refusing to consider ideologically inconvenient data makes it harder to win elections. And as the current administration is making clear, the most vulnerable have a strong interest in Democrats winning elections. According to some estimates, Donald Trump’s defunding of USAID alone has cost more than 10,000 human beings their lives. The election of literally any Democrat last November would have averted those deaths. On a wide variety of fronts, a Joe Manchin presidency would have meant less needless cruelty and suffering than a Trump one. If there is evidence that a Manchin-esque Democrat would have done better than Kamala Harris, we have a responsibility to take that information into account.\n\nPeople will inevitably disagree about how Democrats should balance policy idealism with political expediency. But any rational answer to that question must be premised on an accurate understanding of the relevant tradeoffs. Bonica’s research could help advance such an understanding. But the discourse around it has done the opposite.",

The chicken carcasses are then moved to another part of the plant where workers in cramped and cold conditions cut them up, handling dozens of birds per minute, to be packed for supermarkets and restaurants. Pork plants can currently operate at up to 1,106 pigs per hour.\n\nFor decades, the meat industry has been pushing to both speed up slaughter lines and replace federal inspectors with company employees, wishes that the USDA — under both Republican and Democratic administrations — have granted to varying degrees. Now, the Trump administration plans to give the industry perhaps its biggest win on the issue yet, which worker safety advocates say will make one of the most dangerous jobs in America even worse.\n\nProcessing Meat A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nIn the short term, the USDA will allow a few dozen chicken and pork processing plants that already have temporary waivers to operate slaughter lines faster to continue to do so. But the agency’s longer-term plan is much more consequential: enacting a rule that will allow all pig and chicken slaughterhouses to increase slaughter line speeds.\n\nThis comes at the same time as the Trump administration promises mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, who make up a significant share of the slaughterhouse workforce.\n\nThe meat industry has celebrated the move: The National Pork Producers “extended deep appreciation” to the USDA for its plan and the National Chicken Council and the Meat Institute expressed similar sentiments.\n\nWorker safety advocates, on the other hand, are alarmed.\n\n“Increased line speeds will hurt workers — it’s not a maybe, it’s a definite,” the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents over 15,000 poultry workers, wrote in a statement.\n\nThe debate over slaughter line speeds\n\nAccording to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, workers in slaughterhouses — who make fast, repetitive motions with sharp knives during long shifts — suffer from injuries at far higher rates than those in all of private industry.\n\nBut Debbie Berkowitz, who served as a chief of staff and senior policy adviser at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under President Obama, told me the reality is far worse than even these numbers suggest. Numerous government agencies, including the USDA, she said, have found the BLS’s estimates to be undercounts, and Berkowitz noted that the injury rates are self-reported by meat companies, not tallied up by government inspectors.\n\nExactly how fast the Trump administration will allow meat companies to operate their slaughter lines is unclear — the agency has begun work on a draft rule but didn’t provide details. During President Trump’s first term, the USDA granted or renewed waivers to over 50 chicken slaughter plants, allowing them to increase line speeds from 140 birds per minute to 175. It also sought to eliminate line speed limits at pork facilities altogether, which a federal judge blocked in 2021, arguing the agency failed to consider how it would impact worker safety.\n\nIn response, the USDA commissioned studies comparing chicken plants that operated their slaughter lines at 140 birds per minute to those operating up to 175 birds per minute, and pork plants that operated at the standard 1,106 hogs per hour and then sped up.\n\nThey found that 81 percent of workers at poultry plants and 46 percent at pork plants are at high risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders, like carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis.\n\nThat risk didn’t stem directly from the speed of the automated evisceration lines — the studies found no correlation between the two. But they did find a correlation between risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders and each employee’s workload, or “piece rate” — the number of animals or pieces of meat they cut up per minute. If an individual employee’s workload goes above a certain pace, the researchers found, they’re more likely to get injured.\n\n“There is no doubt from this study that the speed at which workers have to process chickens or swine is directly tied to risk of musculoskeletal disorders,” said Berkowitz.\n\nIn the study, some slaughter plants operating at faster slaughter line speeds added enough staff or automation to make up for the higher workload, but most did not — which increased injury risk.\n\nAn employee removes internal organs from a pig at a Smithfield Foods Inc. pork processing facility in Milan, Missouri.

Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock /Getty Images\n\nTrump’s USDA and meat industry groups have conveniently ignored that critical finding about employee workload — their press releases about the benefits of speeding up slaughter lines fail to say anything about increasing staffing to prevent injury. The temporary waivers that allow slaughter plants to speed up slaughter lines don’t require increased staffing, and the USDA didn’t respond to a question as to whether its proposed rule would mandate it.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union has already called for additional staffing, in addition to “improved reporting of workplace injuries, expanded access to early and adequate medical treatment, and job modifications that minimize ergonomic stressors.”\n\nUltimately, Berkowitz said, the meat industry “runs the USDA — it’s a very captive agency.” And she balked at the USDA and meat industry celebrating a study that found 81 percent of poultry workers and 46 percent of pork workers experiencing such high rates of injury risk: “Are you saying that’s acceptable?”\n\nYou’ve read 1 article in the last month Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.

        "content": "When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market? There’s no simple answer, but there’s a rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run.\n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7 percent, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7 percent, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being that you’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time.\n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10 percent annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\n\n\nFind this and other Vox videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThis video is presented by Robinhood.

His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\n\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!",

He’s worked at Vox since the site’s launch in 2014, and before that, he worked as a research assistant at the New Yorker’s Washington, DC, bureau.\n\nPerhaps the biggest common theme of Donald Trump’s second term is that his administration has aggressively used federal power to punish those deemed to be its — or his — enemies.\n\nSome foreign students who criticized Israel have had their visas revoked and have been whisked into ICE detention.\n\nVenezuelan nationals with tattoos — some likely members of a foreign gang, some likely not — have been deported to El Salvador and imprisoned there.\n\nMajor law firms that displeased Trump have been hit with executive orders aimed at driving their clients away and destroying their businesses.\n\nElite universities that were the site of protests or had policies the administration dislikes have seen hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding revoked.\n\nRelated A longtime target of the right is finally buckling under Trump pressure\n\nIt’s a frightening turn for American governance. Trump and the hard-right appointees who staff this new administration seem intent on ruining the lives of the people they’ve deemed enemies of the state, punishing them with state power.\n\nTrump officials are punishing enemies first — with no process or fairness beforehand\n\nWhat sets much of this apart is that there is no semblance of process or fairness before any of these decisions are made.\n\nDetentions, executive orders, and funding revocations come first — as do deportations, if the administration can get away with them.\n\nAfter that, powerful institutions can possibly, with sufficient bowing and scraping, get these harsh actions rolled back (as the law firm Paul Weiss did and as Columbia University is trying to do). Less powerful people can only hope to sue in court and hope a judge will help them.\n\nThis lack of process beforehand makes it more likely that innocent people are wrongly swept up. But Trump officials don’t seem to mind.\n\nIn their rush to deport Tren de Aragua members to El Salvador before the courts could stop them, they don’t seem to care that they scooped up a gay Venezuelan makeup artist. In their zeal to revoke visas of “antisemitic,” “Hamas-supporting” foreign students, they don’t seem to care that they may have detained a PhD student for co-writing op-eds in a campus newspaper.\n\nTrump set the tone, but his appointees are enthusiastically participating\n\nTrump and his MAGA true-believer appointees are clearly personally responsible for many of these policies aimed at their purported enemies. But more broadly, he’s set an ethic that’s pervaded the administration, even those who are less overtly allied with his movement.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, for instance, bragged Thursday that he was personally responsible for revoking visas of hundreds of anti-Israel protestors. “We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” he said.\n\nAnother telling anecdote came out of the Social Security Administration, currently run by acting appointee Leland Dudek — a career SSA official who decided to work with Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” team and was then promoted to head the agency.\n\nEarlier this month, the agency canceled a contract that allowed parents of newborns in Maine to get Social Security numbers for their new babies at the hospital. After criticism, the decision was reversed, but a mystery remained about why it happened at all. Was it a screw-up? Or was it deliberate punishment of Maine’s people because of a frosty public exchange between Trump and the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills? (Trump had threatened Mills with revoking federal funding over the state’s policies on trans athletes, to which Mills responded, “See you in court.”)\n\nIt was indeed payback aimed at Mills, Dudek admitted to the New York Times last week. “I was ticked at the governor of Maine for not being real cordial to the president,” he said, while acknowledging, “I screwed up.”\n\nDudek wasn’t even a longtime Trump crony (as seen in his willingness to actually admit screwing up). And if his account is correct, no one ordered him to target Maine. He just felt it was the appropriate thing to do when someone was rude to Donald Trump.\n\nThere’s likely more to come\n\nThough US citizens can’t be summarily deported or ordered to leave the country, they can be retaliated against in other ways. For instance, Trump has long been clear about his desire to target his critics or political enemies with criminal prosecutions — but, unlike in his first term, he’s appointed people like FBI director Kash Patel and interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin, who seem eager to actually make that happen.\n\nAn attempt by Martin to have Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criminally investigated for comments he made in a speech flopped, but Martin has moved on to new targets.\n\nOne of those targets is Andrew Weissmann, who was a top prosecutor in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Trump’s ties to Russia, before becoming an MSNBC commentator. Earlier this month, Martin sent a threatening letter to Weissmann, demanding information about a decade-old matter he’d worked on at the Justice Department and alluding to impropriety. This seems like an obvious pretext for targeting Weissmann because he is an enemy of Trump.\n\nFurther targeting of blue states through withholding of federal funds is likely coming too, as seen in, for instance, Trump’s executive order on elections this week.\n\nLegal experts have said that Trump’s revocation of funds in some cases — like the $400 million in grants to Columbia University he canceled — seems flatly illegal. But many targeted institutions have been reluctant to sue in court, fearing even worse retribution.\n\nThe problem is, though, that if this tactic keeps “working” for Trump, he’ll just keep using it, in even more dubious or unlawful ways.\n\nIndeed, it’s been startling how many institutions — corporations, elite law firms, and universities — have caved to Trump’s pressure already. When will it stop? Will it stop?",

To submit a question, email Sigal at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form. Either way, if we choose your question, it’ll be anonymized. Here’s this week’s question, condensed and edited for clarity:\n\nI’m convinced that the fight against authoritarianism is the most important issue of our time. My family immigrated to America from an authoritarian country, and some of my relatives and I are astonished and horrified that the same thing is befalling the US.\n\nThere’s more that I could be doing to participate in the pro-democracy resistance. I’m in a public-facing (not government) job where I could shape my work in a way that draws more attention to Trump’s corruption and war on the American people. But I feel both like my work wouldn’t make much of a difference, and like I will be targeted and punished by the Trump administration for it, so what is the point?\n\nWith the path we’re on now, more and more Americans are going to be persecuted for doing things the administration doesn’t like, and I’m terrified of the potential consequences for myself and my colleagues. It’s a collective action problem, because no one person’s actions alone are going to stop Trump and Musk, yet if we all tell ourselves that the risk isn’t worth the gain to democracy, no one will do anything. How can I navigate this dilemma ethically, rationally, and without ruining my life?\n\nDear Rational Resistance,\n\nGrowing up in the Jewish community, my childhood was full of stories about the Holocaust. I heard horrifying stories, obviously, but also stories about inspiring people who resisted the Nazis — like the “Righteous Gentiles” who hid Jews in their homes at great personal risk. My child-mind obsessed over the question: If I were in their place, would I have had the same courage they did? Would I hide someone in my attic?\n\nI’ve been thinking about this question a lot since January 20. Not because I think today’s America is equal to Nazi Germany, but simply because a lot of us are wondering how far to stick our necks out right now. How do we navigate the tension between personal safety and moral responsibility? Is there something about living in extraordinary times that demands more from us, morally speaking, than we would normally risk?\n\nI don’t think that the moral demandingness of the universe suddenly changes in times like these. Instead, I think times like these open our eyes to the reality that was there all along: We are not just atomized individuals, as Western modernity conditions us to think. We are interdependent. Our fates are connected to the fates of other people, so to truly look out for ourselves and our own family, we have to look out for the broader collective, too.\n\nWhile a special minority of people are always tuned into this — Buddhist monks, say, or extreme do-gooders — most of us only see reality this way when tragedy strikes. As author Larissa MacFarquhar wrote in her book Strangers Drowning: Impossible Idealism, Drastic Choices, and the Urge to Help:\n\nIn wartime — or in a crisis so devastating that it resembles war, such as an earthquake or a hurricane — duty expands far beyond its peacetime boundaries. In wartime, it’s thought dutiful rather than unnatural to leave your family for the sake of a cause. In wartime, the line between family and strangers grows faint, as the duty to one’s own enlarges to encompass all the people who are on the same side… This is the difference between do-gooders and ordinary people: for do-gooders, it is always wartime. They always feel themselves responsible for strangers — they always feel that strangers, like compatriots in war, are their own people.\n\nWhether it’s a war or an earthquake or an attack on democracy, dramatic events can cause a vertiginous shift in perspective, from me-myopia to a more telescopic vision. We see ourselves as part of the bigger story of humanity, which transcends not only national borders, but generations.\n\nHave a question you want me to answer in the next Your Mileage May Vary column?

Sign up here!\n\nI suspect that’s why we all admire the Righteous Gentiles — even though by taking in Jews, they were sometimes putting their own kids at risk, something we normally consider morally dodgy (in fact, it’s so counter to a parent’s wiring that I wouldn’t blame parents who couldn’t bring themselves to do it). They were looking beyond their children to the world they would inherit. What good is it to bring your kid up into a world that’s morally bankrupt? And what would you be modeling for them if you did?\n\nSeeing that bigger story can motivate us to take action against authoritarianism, even when it’s risky. Yes, it may feel scary to stick our necks out now — as you said, “I’m terrified of the potential consequences for myself and my colleagues” — but remember that authoritarians want you to feel too terrified to resist. That’s how they cultivate anticipatory obedience and how they gain power over time.\n\nRight now, for most of us, the risk is actually relatively minimal. Act now and you might lose your job, or maybe even get your organization defunded, resulting in more lost jobs. That’s not nothing. But unless you are an undocumented immigrant or otherwise especially vulnerable under Trump administration policies, you are, right now, not likely to be deported, imprisoned, or physically harmed the way resisters have been in more authoritarian states.\n\nAnd if you don’t act now, America could well become a more authoritarian state. If that happens, people in the future really might not be able to resist without facing extreme consequences. That’s an argument for resisting now, while you can do it at relatively low risk.\n\nIt is not, however, an argument for acting nobly but recklessly. It’s an argument for acting strategically.\n\nConsider the story of Queen Esther from the Hebrew Bible. When she learns of a plot to destroy her people, the Jews, she faces a terrifying choice: She can go to her husband, the king of Persia, to plead for their protection — which would mean risking her own life, since the king would kill anyone who approached him without being summoned — or she can stay silent to protect herself.\n\nAt first, she tells her cousin Mordecai that she can’t just march over the king and speak her mind; that’s not how being queen works. But he responds with a powerful rejoinder: “Who knows if it’s for a time like this that you were made queen to begin with?” What he’s doing there is triggering the vertiginous shift in perspective — getting her to stop seeing herself as an individual and start seeing herself as someone who was always meant to look out for the collective.\n\nYou can be strategic, too. Rather than acting impulsively and alone, you can build a network of support by reaching out to colleagues both inside and outside your organization.\n\nAnd that “who knows?” also acts as a challenge. In situations of moral crisis, people often feel, as you wrote, that “my work wouldn’t make much of a difference” — so why bother? To which Mordecai says: Who knows! It’s possible that your work won’t make a difference — but you don’t know that, so you’ve got to try something.\n\nIt works: Esther acts. But notice how she acts. She doesn’t just rush immediately to the king and tell him to save the Jews. First, she builds a network of support and develops a multi-part strategy. She dresses up to the nines, making herself attractive to the king so he might want to keep her around. She invites the king and his vizier to a party, where she wines and dines them. The next day she invites them to another party. Gradually, through carefully orchestrated moments of influence, she reveals the truth and makes her ask.\n\nEsther is what the Dutch historian Rutger Bregman might call a Noble Winner. In Moral Ambition, Bregman urges readers to be more ambitious about the good they can do for the world. As he points to historical examples of people who stood up for what’s right, he notes that some are “Noble Losers” — they take a personal stand, but nothing much comes of it. Think of that famous photo showing a crowd of Germans all saluting Hitler, and the single man who refused to salute.\n\n“He was on the right side of history, but he didn’t make history,” Bregman writes. “If you really want to change things, then someone like Rosa Parks is a better role model.”\n\nParks was a Noble Winner. She didn’t just decide one day, in a rash moment of fury, to refuse to give up her seat on that bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Instead, she spent years quietly getting involved with the civil rights movement and studying protest tactics. Her refusal to surrender her seat was planned. An action group called the Women’s Political Council strategically portrayed her as a kindly seamstress and demure heroine — someone milquetoast enough for white Americans to get behind — and launched the call to boycott the bus system the instant she was arrested. The careful planning and collaboration paid off: They achieved not just fame, but concrete wins.\n\nYou can be strategic, too. Rather than acting impulsively and alone, you can build a network of support by reaching out to colleagues both inside and outside your organization. If you’re a nonprofit employee, you can organize within your union and push them to take a particular stance. If you’re an educator, you can coordinate action with other schools. If you’re a journalist, you can reach out to other journalists to forge consensus around covering news events in a certain way — for example, calling a purge a purge. The point is to reach out to others and build power together.\n\nAnd one more word about those Righteous Gentiles. After the Holocaust, psychologists began to study them to figure out what made them courageously agree to hide Jews while the majority went along with tyranny. Maybe they were friends with Jews before the war? Maybe they had spare rooms or extra savings tucked away? Maybe some people just come wired with an altruistic personality?\n\nNope. The psychologists found that none of these factors made the difference. Instead, as Bregman recounts in his book:\n\nTurns out there was one circumstance that determined almost everything. A new analysis of data … showed that when this condition was met, nearly everyone took action — 96 percent to be precise. And what was that condition? Simple: you had to be asked. Those who were asked to help someone in danger almost always said yes.\n\nAsking things of each other and acting together is how we move unjust systems. So go ahead. Reach out to someone. Ask.\n\nBonus: What I’m reading\n\nIn the New Yorker, Kyle Chayka writes about “ Elon Musk’s AI-fueled war on human agency .” He notes that “a government run by people is cautious and slow by design; a machine-automated version will be fast and ruthless, reducing the need for either human labor or human decision-making.”\n\nAre major trends in philosophy today the consequence of the fact that most “great” Western thinkers were … bachelors? The philosopher Mary Midgley thought so. Having no experience of living with women and children, she argued, led these unmarried men to generate philosophy that is overly abstract and removed from life, as this Aeon essay explains\n\nIn a previous installment of this advice column , I challenged the idea that having a child always fundamentally transforms someone’s personality. So when I saw Olga Khazan’s new article on the topic , with the subtitle “I knew that becoming a parent would change me — but I had no idea how” — it was an instant click for me. The always-hilarious Olga does not disappoint.\n\nThis story was originally published in The Highlight, Vox’s member-exclusive magazine.

(Klein is a co-founder of Vox and now a columnist for the New York Times; Thompson writes for the Atlantic.)\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

(Are they secret libertarians just trying to sneak deregulation into the Democratic platform? Should they be willing to speak to New Right personalities? Are they too agreeable to take on the many parts of the Democratic coalition that stand to lose if we try to build things more cheaply?)\n\nAs for me, I enjoy the book and agree with 90 percent of it, which shouldn’t be surprising from my own body of work. But I have one serious concern that I haven’t seen anyone else raise.\n\nLearning to love small government\n\nI’ve been finding myself grateful in the last few years and especially in the last few months for the existence of federalism.\n\nHere in the US it is states, not the national government, that run elections, which makes it much harder for an authoritarian in the White House to rig an election in their favor.\n\nRelated Democrats need to do something by The Gray Area with Sean Illing\n\nIt is states, not the national government, that run schools, so to change school policies the national government has to persuade the locals — or at least bribe them, as Trump is attempting to do with threats to withhold federal funds from any state that allows trans children to compete in girls’ sports. The government doesn’t directly control health care providers, so it has fewer avenues to interfere with insurance coverage of procedures it disagrees with, like transition or abortion. State and federal governments effectively no longer have the power to order neighborhoods bulldozed for highways, and I consider that a very good thing.\n\nIt’s far from all upside, of course. Federalism also allows for injustices to persist past when there’d be sufficient national support to abolish them; I expect many states still wouldn’t have legalized gay marriage if it’d been left up to the states.\n\nPart of why the word has such a bad reputation on the left is the frequency with which it was leveraged to keep the horrifying racial segregation of the pre-Civil Rights Act South from becoming a national concern. And as Abundance explores in detail, the devolution of systems to local control produces policies that can be locally popular but nationally disastrous. Few people want more housing next door, but few people are happy about the state that America’s largest cities are currently in, either.\n\nThere are very serious downsides. But the upside of our sometimes kludgy federal system is a backstop against tyranny that I, for one, have recently become very grateful for.\n\nA government that has more power is a good thing if the government will only, or at least mostly, do good things. But if you think that the government’s power will frequently be wielded to hurt you and people like you, you will rediscover a fondness for low state capacity, devolution to local control, and a system with lots and lots of veto points.\n\nIs a weak state worse than a strong one?\n\nOr maybe not. Because there is an argument that in fact, if you add too many veto points to the system, you actually end up empowering autocrats, rather than putting up barriers to them.\n\nYou could argue that people are sympathetic to actions like DOGE’s smashing and hacking through the federal bureaucracy because they feel on an intuitive level that the rules make it impossible to get anything done, so anyone who wants to act must go around the rules. And at that point, why quibble over which exact rules got broken? In this view state capacity and the rule of law reinforce each other; paralysis is unsustainable, and the ways it ruptures will usually be ugly, as we may be seeing now.\n\nI might end up finding myself persuaded by that argument, but I want to see it made. You won’t really find it in Abundance, one of the ways that makes it clear that it was initially written chiefly to influence a potential Democratic administration. Indeed, the book was originally meant to be published in the summer of 2024, right in the middle of the presidential election.\n\nBut it came out instead in March 2025, a couple of months into a second Trump administration that seems even darker than many people’s worst fears. Abundance is a vision of the future of big government, and right now every bit of news I see out of the White House makes me grateful for limits on government.\n\nI think that if the Trump administration had more state capacity, things would be worse — and I think that any progressive administration rebuilding in the aftermath of Trump should count among the failures that brought us to this stage the unwillingness to limit state power as well as the unwillingness to effectively use it. Let’s figure out how to build, absolutely. But let’s only give the state power we’ll be glad it has when our enemies are wielding it.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here!",

Benji previously worked as a wildlife researcher.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with The Dodo.\n\nOne morning this week, Hanna Koch was snorkeling in the Florida Keys when she came across a brown beer bottle on the sea floor. Koch, a marine biologist for Florida’s Monroe County, picked up the bottle, planning to carry it with her and later toss it out.\n\nThrough her dive mask, Koch peered inside to make sure it was empty.\n\nThat’s when she saw an eyeball.\n\n“There was something staring back at me,” Koch told me.\n\nIt wasn’t just one eyeball, actually — but dozens. Inside the bottle was an octopus mom with a brood of babies.\n\n“You could see their eyes, you could see their tentacles,” Koch said in a recent interview with Vox and The Dodo. “They were fully formed.” (Octopuses technically have arms, not tentacles.)\n\nInstead of taking the bottle with her and throwing it away like she initially intended, Koch handed it to her colleague, another marine biologist, who carefully placed it back on the sandy sea floor. Based on the images and video, Chelsea Bennice, a marine biologist at Florida Atlantic University, said the animal was likely a species of pygmy octopus — making this whole encounter even cuter.\n\nCourtesy of Hanna Koch\n\nOn one hand, it’s hopeful to find life — an octopus family! — living in rubbish. “One man’s trash is another octopuse’s nursery,” as University of Miami environmental scientist Jennifer Jacquet told me when I showed her the photos. Her graduate student, Janelle Kaz, said it’s actually not uncommon for octopuses to take up residence in beer bottles. “They are highly curious and opportunistic,” Jacquet said.\n\nBut it’s also a reminder that, as Florida ecosystems decline, there are fewer and fewer places for wildlife to live. Overfishing, pollution, and climate change have devastated near-shore habitats in the Keys — and especially coral reefs — in the last few decades.\n\nHanna Koch\n\nThe irony, Koch told me, is that she runs a state-funded project in Monroe County to create “artificial reefs:” structures, often made of concrete, to enhance the habitat for fish, lobsters, and other sea creatures. And she was actually snorkeling that morning to figure out where to put some of the structures.\n\n“This octopus found artificial habitat to make its home,” Koch said. “I was just like, ‘Wait momma, because I’m going to put out some better habitat for you — something that someone can’t pick up and throw away.’”",

There are some who seem to have the innate ability to keep their spices alphabetized, their clothes separated by color and season, and power cords neatly wound all in one place. Then there are others with more junk drawers than regular ones and small collections of stuff that have accumulated over time.\n\nIf you’re a member of the latter group, you may have been one of the many curious minds scouring Google for decluttering tips — the search term hit a five-year high in 2025 — or found yourself in a hypnotic home organizing TikTok wormhole.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

In her experience, the greatest decluttering hurdle is finding the will to get started. Some clients have the perception that the task will be too difficult, the project too big. Maybe you’re in the same boat. Or perhaps the online content you’ve seen around home organization — rife with expensive bins and colorful labels — has you feeling pressured to drop hundreds of dollars on products. However, the secret to decluttering, experts say, is to rely on function over aesthetics and to organize like a real person and not an influencer.\n\nStart with a small, manageable task\n\nFor those who struggle getting started, take some pressure off: You don’t need to organize your entire house in one weekend. But you should begin with a smaller task or area, ideally one that causes you the most aggravation. Are you constantly tripping over shoes and bookbags as soon as you walk in the door? Start with your entranceway. Does your laundry pile up on an office chair that you’d really like to sit in again? Tackle that first. Do you struggle to find a spot for groceries in the fridge? Make that your project for the day.\n\n“Decluttering is decision-making,” Wiss says, “and it’s exhausting, and there’s decision fatigue, and you could at some point just hit a wall.”\n\nIf even those assignments seem too big, Wiss suggests breaking them down into micro-tasks: clearing out just the vegetable drawer or storing winter coats. Keep these smaller projects relegated to one room and commit to slowly making progress over time, says professional organizer Robyn Reynolds, the CEO of Southern California-based company Organize2Harmonize. “If you do a corner here in this room and a corner there in the other room, you’re not really going to see the progress and then you’re going to feel defeated,” she says. “But if you actually are able to finish an entire room, then you’re going to feel really motivated and proud of yourself because you actually did it.”\n\nYou might let that momentum carry you onto another small to-do list item. But be mindful of your energy levels. You don’t want to empty your pantry and lack the motivation to put everything back. “Decluttering is decision-making,” Wiss says, “and it’s exhausting, and there’s decision fatigue, and you could at some point just hit a wall and then you still need for those piles to go somewhere.”\n\nTry the three-second rule for purging\n\nWiss has a straightforward three-step approach to decluttering: Sort like with like, purge, then containerize. First, make sure everything you want to organize is in one place. For instance, all of your chargers should live in one area, all of your shoes should be stored in the same place, all your bowls and plates should be in the kitchen. Then, you can see how many chargers or sneakers or bowls you have and pare down where needed.\n\nIf you’re finding it hard to part with impractical but sentimental items… Remind yourself that you’re not discarding the memory of a loved one, just their possessions. If the item is not your style and you’ll never use it, let it go. Don’t hold onto items that will only get damaged over years in storage. “So many times when I clear out garages with clients,” Reynolds says, “so many things we find [have] mold or water damage. So what was the point of holding on to it when it just got destroyed and now they’re throwing it out anyway?”\n\nThe purge stage can often be challenging because many people attach memories and sentiments to objects and find it difficult to part with them. Kayleen Kelly, a professional organizer in Olympia, Washington, developed a three-second rule to help her clients pare down items. After you’ve collected and sorted all of one category of item — like coffee mugs — go through one by one and decide which item you’ll keep. If you hesitate for more than three seconds when weighing whether or not to keep a specific mug, it’s an automatic keep. This technique ensures you’re making confident decisions about what to get rid of. “If you can’t decide,” Kelly says, “and you hesitate, there’s no punishment for indecision. So you just keep it and you keep moving forward.”\n\nTo further aid your decision-making process, ask yourself if the item is actually useful, Reynolds says. Again, not everything needs to be utilitarian, but it isn’t worth keeping posters from college you never plan on hanging up again. But if you do manage to get infrequent but meaningful use out of that family heirloom fondue pot, by all means, keep it. Reynolds also recommends taking photos of sentimental but impractical items and collecting them in a photo book or digital slideshow. That way, you can memorialize grandma’s couch without needing to sacrifice space for it in your basement.\n\nOnce you’ve pared down items, you can properly organize them. This is where you’ll create a system for your closet, garage, pantry, or other area you’re decluttering. It can be as simple as dedicating one shelf in the linen closet to sheets and another for towels.\n\nDon’t spend money on organizers when an old shoebox will do\n\nExperts have observed clients’ all-too-common urge to buy expensive organizers and bins before they even start discarding items. Online, influencers push aesthetically pleasing storage containers and label makers, only adding to the pressure that true decluttering involves spending money. “It’s not about buying more products,” Kelly says. The reality is, once you pare down your makeup brushes, you may realize you don’t need a container, and a cup from the kitchen will do.\n\nThe most important aspect of organizing, Kelly says, is for your system of choice to be functional, so don’t waste money on eight-tier hangers if you know you lack the patience to put eight shirts on them. If you do need a container, try to reuse what you already have at home, like a shoebox, Tupperware, an old iPhone box, or a piece of cardboard from an Amazon box as a drawer organizer. For everything else, your local dollar store will have inexpensive organizers and bins.\n\nDonate what you don’t need\n\nThe most integral aspect of decluttering is to remove the clutter from your space. Don’t get hung up on the logistics until after you’ve set aside the items you want to get rid of, Kelly says. In her experience, most of her clients’ discarded items are in good enough condition to be donated. “Find a place in your local area that takes the majority of everything,” she says. That might be your local Goodwill, Salvation Army, thrift store, or women’s shelter.\n\nRelated Buy less stuff\n\nAfter organizing smaller spaces, like your linen closet or the cabinet under the sink, you may have a more limited collection of items to donate. You can be more targeted with these donations, Kelly says, since you have less to discard — and fewer decisions to make.\n\nLocal Buy Nothing Facebook groups are also effective in finding your stuff a new home.\n\nFor items that can’t be donated or given away, look up your city or town’s recycling rules. If all else fails, throw items in the trash.\n\nMake it a habit\n\nBecause life inevitably happens, systems may fall into disarray and products may once again accumulate. Decluttering should be an ongoing process throughout the year.\n\nTo keep her clients in a clutter-free state of mind, Reynolds often imparts some words of wisdom. “Everything has a price: time, space, money, or energy,” she says. Consider what your clutter is costing you in terms of the time that could be better spent doing anything other than decluttering, the space your items take up, the money it costs to keep, and the vibe it brings to your home.",

        "content": "covers politics Vox. She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\n\nWe’re making this story accessible to all readers as a public service. At Vox, our mission is to help everyone access essential information that empowers them. Support our journalism by becoming a member today.\n\nThese are uncertain times for many immigrants in the US.\n\nThere have been reports of individual visa and green card holders and tourists who have been detained and deported. However, the Trump administration does not seem to be indiscriminately targeting legal immigrants who have authorization to be in the US on a large scale.\n\nSome have reportedly been targeted based on their political activism. A Brown University professor and doctor with a green card was deported after officials found photos of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran’s supreme leader on her phone. Immigration authorities also invoked a Trump executive order prohibiting antisemitism to detain a former Columbia student and green card holder who helped lead campus protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nIn other cases, the Trump administration hasn’t clarified its rationale for detaining someone. A German citizen with a green card was interrogated by border officials in Boston and detained without access to his anxiety medication. It’s not clear if the government has charged him with a crime. Similarly, the administration had not offered an official explanation for detaining a Turkish doctoral student as of Tuesday.\n\nAnd it’s not just immigrants who have been affected. A US citizen said he was walking down the streets of Chicago when he was arrested by immigration agents, who confiscated his ID and held him for 10 hours before releasing him.\n\nEven though limited in number, these cases have been going viral — and are understandably causing fear in immigrant communities.\n\nAccording to immigration attorneys, it’s hard to tell how worried immigrants who are legally living and working in the US need to be.\n\n“After practicing for 40 years, it’s really difficult to divine what a measured response is right now,” said Kathleen Campbell Walker, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nSo far, cases of individuals with visas and green cards being detained or deported appear rare. That said, the lawyers I spoke with advised these immigrants, as well as US citizens, to consider certain precautions in an environment of such uncertainty.\n\nConsider carrying identification documents\n\nLegal non-citizen immigrants have long been legally required to carry their immigration papers at all times. However, the penalties for failing to do so are becoming higher under Trump.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration is expected to increase the associated fines from $100 to $5,000, Campbell Walker said. Failing to possess documentation is a misdemeanor. That could now land an immigrant in detention and deportation proceedings; Trump revoked the Biden administration’s immigration enforcement priorities so that even people charged with nonviolent, minor crimes can now be deported.\n\nRelatedly, next month the Trump administration will also start requiring all noncitizens to register with the federal government and designate those who fail to do so as a priority for immigration enforcement. Many noncitizens who have had previous contact with the federal government — whether because they applied for certain immigration benefits or were issued a notice to appear in immigration court — are already considered registered under the new policy.\n\nCampbell Walker said US citizens should also consider carrying a passport card that fits in their wallet, or birth certificate, as proof of their nationality, given the reports of Americans swept up in Trump’s immigration enforcement activities. In some of these cases, she said, there have been concerns that immigration agents are racially and ethnically profiling their targets.\n\n“Carrying documents on your person, making sure that people who are not citizens or naturalized or acquired citizens have one place in your home where you have all your important documentation together and making sure that you have copies — those are all reasonable and important steps to be taking in a moment like this, when we see the administration attacking free speech rights and attacking the basic norms of due process,” said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nReconsider international travel\n\nImmigration attorneys are urging immigrants to exercise caution in traveling abroad right now.\n\nFollowing the deportation of one of their professors, Brown University advised “out of an abundance of caution” that even green card holders delay any personal travel outside the US. The university said that changes in requirements to reenter the country and a draft proposal for a travel ban targeting 43 countries that could be implemented as early as this week might impact its students and staff.\n\n“I believe that a lot of green card holders are making the decision to consult with an attorney before traveling, and I think that’s a reasonable consideration,” Altman said.\n\nImmigrants should consider whether their country of origin or where they are planning to travel may be on the list of countries that could be subjected to travel bans. They should also weigh their own history of activism and whether that could make them a target upon reentry to the US.\n\n“We know that this administration is engaging in retaliatory actions against people who have engaged in constitutionally protected activism and speech,” Altman said. “And so I think people may want to think about their own history and imagine and explore if it might put them at high interest for retaliatory targeting and talk to an attorney about precautionary steps that can be taken before travel.”\n\nProtect your privacy on social media and on your electronic devices\n\nIf you must travel, consider leaving your personal electronic devices at home. Border officials can (and recently have) requested access to immigrants’ devices, including their cellphones.\n\nRefusing to grant them access might give them grounds to deny entry on the basis that they have insufficient information to determine if an immigrant is “admissible” to the US. But Campbell Walker said that she is concerned about officers lacking the training required to appropriately evaluate what’s on a personal device.\n\nShe said that, based on reports from member attorneys of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, officials are now looking through social media feeds on people’s phones for reasons to deny them admission to the US.\n\n“I’m not asking anyone to lie. I’m not trying to obstruct justice,” she said. “But if somebody who may not have sufficient training is going to rip through a cellphone and jump to conclusions and potentially remove me or prevent me from entering the US, I don’t think it’s advisable to have a bunch of social media or photographs on the phone you travel with. I don’t think it’s very wise to be traveling with your [personal] laptop.”",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he focuses on the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the decline of liberal democracy in the United States. He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nA Vox reader asks: If we have “separation of church and state,” why do we give religious schools tax exemption? How come religious schools get government funding? Why was Trump allowed to campaign on religion and publicly sell Bibles? Why does it say “In God We Trust” on our money? Why is “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance?\n\nThe concept of “separation of church and state” isn’t quite as ironclad as you may think.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits laws “respecting an establishment of religion,” a provision that many Americans believe should create a firm wall of separation between church and state. But the Constitution also does not enforce itself. In the United States, we rely on judges and Supreme Court justices to determine what the Constitution means and to apply it to individual cases.\n\nThat means that the amount of church and state separation in the United States tends to ebb and flow depending on who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe idea that the government should play no role in funding or encouraging religion probably hit its high water mark in the mid-20th century. As the Supreme Court said in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” That suggests that it is unconstitutional to fund any religious activity with money collected from taxes.\n\nBeginning in the Nixon administration, however, the Court started to move steadily rightward. Nixon filled four of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, though most of his nominees were relative moderates compared to the increasingly ideological justices chosen by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.\n\nToday, the Republican Party has a 6-3 supermajority on the Supreme Court, and when church and state cases have come before them, all six of those Republicans have behaved exactly how you would expect members of a political movement closely aligned with conservative Christianity to behave. That means that the Court is now actively tearing down whatever barrier used to exist between church and state.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nWhy is religion in public schools and on American money?\n\nLet’s start with Carson v. Makin (2022), in which the Republican justices concluded that, if a state offers vouchers to help some students pay for private education, it must allow those vouchers to be spent on religious schools. The Court also recently announced that it will hear two other cases, out of Oklahoma, which are likely to require states to fund religious charter schools.\n\nRelated A new Supreme Court case would force the government to create religious public schools\n\nIf you’re looking for an explanation for this shift, you will not find it in the Constitution, as the text of the First Amendment has not changed. You will find it instead within the shifting personnel within the Supreme Court.\n\nThe question of whether taxpayers must fund religious schools is a hotly contested one and is likely to hinge on which political party controls the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future. But it’s worth acknowledging that there are people of faith in both political parties. Americans of all political persuasions care a great deal about their churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues.\n\nIndeed, that may explain why Trump — who, as a private citizen campaigning for office, had a First Amendment right to say anything he wanted to say about religion — chose to center religion in his campaign and even sell Bibles. The Bible is literally the most popular book in the world, and millions of American voters look fondly upon politicians who align themselves with it.\n\nAnd this reality also shapes how, say, US tax policy functions.\n\nThere’s never been a serious effort to strip religious charities, including houses of worship, of their tax-exempt status. And there probably never will be, because the people who attend those houses of worship are voters, and they would likely rise up in outrage if such a thing were attempted.\n\nThat said, the Constitution has also long been understood to forbid religious discrimination. So these tax exemptions must be offered equally to people of all faiths. If a church can claim a tax exemption, a mosque must also be able to claim that same exemption on the same terms.\n\nSimilarly, there are some largely ceremonial or symbolic nods to religion — such as the use of the phrase “In God we Trust” on US coins, or the opening of many legislative sessions with a prayer — that, as the Supreme Court said in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), are “deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country,” a history and tradition that — especially early on — was intertwined with Christianity. The courts have left many of these symbolic acknowledgments of religion in place, in part because attempting to dislodge them is unlikely to be successful.\n\nTo understand why, consider a controversy that briefly flared up during the second Bush administration. In 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that the inclusion of the words “under God” in a public school’s daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Constitution. That decision triggered a massive backlash among members of Congress, including a bipartisan proposal to amend the Constitution to permit “a reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance or on United States currency.”",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

He is the author of the 2018 book, Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood , an exploration of border conflicts, unrecognized countries, and changes to the world map.\n\nA photo taken with a cellphone on March 19, 2025, shows smoke and fire rising from a neighborhood following an airstrike in Sanaa, Yemen. ﻿Str/Xinhua via Getty Images\n\nWashington has been convulsed over the past week by the question of how a prominent journalist was invited into a private Signal chat between senior Trump administration officials over an impending military action and why that conversation was happening on Signal at all.\n\nBut the actual topic that these officials were discussing — a strike on the Houthis, an Iran-backed militant group that controls Yemen’s capital and much of its territory — has gotten somewhat lost.\n\nThere’s been remarkably little discussion about why an administration that pledged to reduce US military commitments is now conducting nearly daily airstrikes on a country in the Middle East and what these strikes might accomplish.\n\nHere’s how we got here.\n\nThe Houthis have been carrying out missile and drone attacks on shipping through the Red Sea since shortly after the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. This has had a disruptive effect on international shipping, forcing container ships to make the long trip around the Southern tip of Africa rather than the much shorter voyage through the Suez Canal. However, the shipping industry has largely adapted to the change.\n\nToday, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nIn response, the US, under the Biden administration, along with several European countries, launched a military operation to protect shipping and, at the beginning of last year, began direct airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen. This did not stop the attacks.\n\nThe Houthis only scaled back their attacks on shipping after an Israel-Hamas ceasefire went into effect this January, but shipping companies have been cautious about returning to the route. The Houthis have also not been entirely quiet: They’ve launched attacks on US naval vessels in the Red Sea and downed several US drones.\n\nIn early March, the Houthis threatened to resume attacks on Israel-linked shipping in response to Israel blocking aid into Gaza. Since Israel restarted its war in Gaza on March 18, the Houthis have launched a series of missile attacks on Israel.\n\nOn March 15, the Trump administration began its own airstrikes against the Houthis. Near-daily airstrikes have continued since then.\n\nAside from just being generally more extensive and intense, President Donald Trump’s strikes are different from Joe Biden’s in that they appear to be targeting senior Houthi leaders personally, rather than weapons sites or command-and-control targets. (Former Biden officials say “persona strikes” were considered but not carried out before they left office). These strikes have succeeded in killing a number of senior Houthi leaders, though the group has been cagey about admitting which ones.\n\nIn the Signal chats published by the Atlantic, national security adviser Mike Waltz refers to the killing of the Houthis’ “top missile guy.”\n\n“We had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed,” Waltz wrote. I asked several experts on Yemen, and none knew who this “top missile guy” was or what specific strike this referred to. The US struck a number of buildings that night, and more than 30 people were killed, according to local authorities.\n\nSome commentators have suggested that Waltz may be describing a war crime here: leveling an entire building with civilians inside to kill one target. This is difficult to judge: The legality of civilian casualties in war depends on the military value of the target and whether reasonable precautions were taken to protect civilians. That’s hard to determine here without more information. But it does appear that the Trump administration has a higher tolerance for risk when it comes to civilian casualties, which would be consistent with policy moves made at the Pentagon by Secretary of State Pete Hegseth.\n\nThere’s also the question of whether these strikes — and Biden’s before them — violate the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which requires the president to report to Congress on the reason and legal authority for military action and imposes a 60-day time limit on hostilities conducted without congressional authorization. It is generally accepted that the president, under Article II of the Constitution, does have the legal authority to launch military action to repel sudden attacks without action by Congress, but an ongoing operation like this one is a stretch.\n\nBeyond legality, there’s the question of whether these strikes can actually accomplish their objectives. Trump officials have described the rationale for the strikes as ensuring freedom of navigation through the Red Sea and “reestablishing deterrence.”\n\nIn remarks at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said “the Houthis want peace because they’re getting the hell knocked out of them,” but vowed to continue the strikes until the group ceases its attacks on shipping. “They want us to stop so badly… They’ve got to say, ‘No mas,’” Trump said.\n\nTrump has also said he holds the Houthis’ main international supporter, Iran, responsible for the attacks and threatened “dire” consequences for the Iranians. That threat came as Trump is dialing up pressure on Tehran in hopes of negotiating a new nuclear deal, but has also not ruled out using military force.\n\nWill any of this actually stop the Houthis’ attacks or hurt Iran? There’s evidence the Houthis have sustained heavy damage and a number of high-ranking casualties and are changing their operations in response to the strikes.\n\nBut the group also endured years of heavy airstrikes from Saudi Arabia, using US weapons. Resisting western military power is their main claim to legitimacy (The group’s official motto is “God is great, death to the US, death to Israel, curse the Jews, and victory for Islam.”) and as with Hamas in Gaza, they’re willing to endure heavy casualties to themselves and to civilians in the name of their cause.\n\nAll that means that they’re unlikely to buckle quickly and that like every other presidential administration this century, Trump’s second term may involve more military action in the Middle East than he was planning.",

A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they’re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.\n\nLate in Hulu’s new series Good American Family comes a moment of irony that’s become all too familiar in true crime docudramas. The fictionalized Natalia Grace Barnett — at this point in the story a teen, being played by the 27-year-old Imogen Faith Reid — glowingly reads supportive comments from random internet strangers. “I feel so bad I doubted you, Natalia,” one comment reads, “but I guess that’s what the media wanted.”\n\nAh, yes: the ancient narrative that the media made a complicated situation worse, being proffered by a piece of media that’s currently making it worse.\n\nGood American Family dramatizes the twisted saga of Natalia Grace, a Ukraine-born adoptee who was born in 2003, 1989, or somewhere in between, according to a litany of contradicting stories and court records. The new series’ interminable eight episodes rehash the saga many Americans first learned about in 2019, when her second set of adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, gained media attention for adopting and then abandoning her in the US when they moved to Canada without her. The Barnetts publicly claimed that their daughter was an evil, murderous 20-something con artist pretending to be a little girl.\n\nYes, it’s the plot of the movie Orphan, but in real life. (To be clear, Natalia Grace’s tale did not inspire the 2009 movie, as she was adopted in 2010, but may well have been inspired by it.) The Barnetts’ behavior resulted in ultimately unsuccessful criminal charges of neglect. Though the messy details of this back and forth are recounted for viewers, including the accompanying media spectacle, the Hulu series ultimately does little to justify itself, either as entertainment or as a further examination of an abuse victim whose entire life has been lived under a magnifying glass as a result of her abuse.\n\nHere’s what to know about the saga of Natalia — and why the Hulu docuseries probably isn’t the last time you’ll be hearing her name, even though it probably should be.\n\nNatalia was 6 or 7 — or maybe 8 or 9 — when she was adopted in 2010\n\nBy their own telling, Indiana residents Kristine and Michael Barnett and their three sons were an all-American family: Kristine would go on to author a much-lauded book about raising her son Jacob, who is a high-functioning child prodigy. The memoir, The Spark, was so popular it was nominated for a Goodreads Choice Award in 2013 — but while it details Kristine Barnett’s miraculous job parenting her sons, it reportedly contains no mention whatsoever of the little girl she adopted alongside them.\n\nThe Barnetts adopted Natalia in 2010. According to Michael Barnett, they were only given 24 hours by a shady adoption agency to make a decision about adopting her, and were provided very little information about Natalia’s background and medical history. What we know is that Natalia’s birth mother had been born in Latvia and was living in Ukraine at the time of Natalia’s birth, which was listed on Natalia’s birth certificate as September 4, 2003. She placed Natalia in an orphanage. In 2008, at the age of 5, she was brought to the US by Dyan and Gary Ciccone, a New Hampshire couple with ties to an area adoption agency focused on Russian adoptees. What happened is unclear, but Natalia’s unsuccessful placement underscores the often murky and dysfunctional process of adoption, especially international adoptions, which can exploit children.\n\nImogen Faith Reid, Ellen Pompeo, and Mark Duplass in Good American Family. Disney/Ser Baffo\n\nThe Barnetts immediately ran into problems with the adoption. They claimed that Natalia, who was born with dwarfism, was showing signs of puberty, including menstruation and pubic hair, despite being only 6 or 7 according to her official birth certificate. They also claimed that Natalia had tried repeatedly to kill them, including by placing thumbtacks on the stairs, pouring Pine Sol into coffee, wielding knives, and allegedly pulling Kristine Barnett into an electric fence. According to Michael Barnett, their response to these incidents included begging the police to arrest their 7-year-old; police declined. Child services were alerted to the situation, however, and began investigating the couple’s treatment of their daughter. During the same period, the Barnetts had Natalia seen by various medical experts, apparently in attempts to determine her “real” age. Medical providers in the Barnetts’ lives have since come forward to allege that they told the Barnetts Natalia was a child.\n\nTo this day, it’s not fully clear whether the Barnetts actually believed their own lie about Natalia being an adult, or whether they just made it up as an excuse to be rid of her. Kristine Barnett has fallen back on the medical advice she claims she was given by experts, while Michael Barnett has emphasized the court rulings concerning her age; the new Hulu docuseries depicts him as being manipulated by Kristine’s own narcissism, though not without culpability.\n\nIn 2012, the Barnetts successfully petitioned a probate court to change Natalia’s official birth year from 2003 to 1989, which made her legally 22 years old instead of 8. According to court documents, the change was made “based on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and a social worker,” without holding an evidentiary hearing or providing Natalia with her own legal representative in the matter. This also meant that the child services case was closed, since Natalia was now legally an adult.\n\nAround the time of this ruling, Natalia spent nine weeks in a mental hospital. She also spent time at a halfway house. The Barnetts rented two subsequent apartments for her, including one in Lafayette, Indiana — a decision made, according to court testimony from a state police detective, “Because Kristine said Lafayette is a white-trash town and nobody is going to care or worry about [Natalia].” The Barnetts also appeared to disbelieve that the physical disabilities associated with Natalia’s medical condition were real; though she had used a walker since she was a child, the apartment they rented for her was on the second floor of a house with no easy street access. After relocating Natalia to this isolated, inaccessible house in Lafayette, the Barnetts moved to Canada with their sons in 2013, leaving her behind. Natalia never saw Kristine Barnett again.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2014 — but their entanglement with Natalia was only just beginning.\n\nThe courts perpetuate a wrong and then fail to redress it\n\nFollowing her abandonment by the Barnetts in 2013, Natalia was taken in by Cynthia and Antwon Mans and their children. (Some reports say the Mans have 10 children, others say five.) Over the next decade, Natalia and others tried repeatedly to have her age change reversed in the courts, only for the courts to reaffirm that she was an adult. Natalia was legally considered an adult for most of her childhood. At one point, per court records, the Mans attempted to gain legal guardianship over Natalia, only for Michael Barnett to block their efforts because, he claimed, Natalia was an adult.\n\n“All I was told was, ‘You’re 22 now,’” Natalia later told ID’s multiseason docuseries about the saga, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace. “‘Whenever somebody asks you what your age is, you say you’re 22 and you tried to murder your family.’ I was taught to lie.”\n\nProsecutors soon became interested in Natalia’s case. Confusion over Natalia’s actual age began to dominate the investigation into the Barnetts’ behavior, which was serious enough that they were each charged separately in 2019 with criminal counts related to both child neglect and neglect of a dependent [adult]. The child neglect charges were ultimately dismissed due to the outstanding quandary of her age.\n\nIn 2023, a DNA lab conducted testing that seemed to conclusively put the matter of Natalia’s age to rest: She was likely around two years older than the age indicated by her birth certificate at the time of her adoption, born around 2001. At the time of her adoption, she would have been 8 or 9, and at the time of her abandonment in Lafayette, she would have been 11 or 12 — not 23, as the court system legally claimed.\n\nBut because the original court ruling still stood, in 2020, prosecutors had to drop all charges related to child neglect. At Michael Barnett’s 2022 trial for neglect of a dependent adult, Natalia testified against her adopted father. She alleged that she had fallen repeatedly while attempting to navigate her inaccessible apartment, and that the Barnetts had left her to fend for herself without teaching her how to access her disability payments or perform basic tasks like laundry or food preparation.\n\nMichael Barnett’s lawyer, however, was able to successfully allege that at 23 — the only age Natalia was legally permitted to acknowledge under the court ruling — she should have been able to do all of those tasks as a functioning adult. Defense attorneys also implied that the Mans family were manipulating and exploiting Natalia — allegations of stealing benefits that would linger after the trial. Jurors ultimately found Michael Barnett not guilty on the neglect charge, and the pending charges against Kristine Barnett were subsequently dropped.\n\nFrom there, despite the mudslinging, it seemed as though things were finally resolved between Natalia and the Barnetts. By that point, however, the Barnetts, Natalia, and the Mans were something more than a set of dysfunctional squabbling families — they were all reality stars.\n\nFrom one messy situation to another\n\nIn late 2019, the news of criminal charges laid against the Barnetts began to make headlines, and the lives of all involved irrevocably changed. Tabloid media quickly labeled Natalia a “‘Psycho’ dwarf,” and Natalia and the Mans family went on Dr. Phil — and all of this was within weeks of the story coming to light.\n\nThen came ID’s multiseason docuseries, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, which began airing in 2023 shortly after the court proceedings. By that point, Natalia was living with the Mans family, who the docuseries framed as her saviors. The Mans, who claimed Natalia had never been dangerous at all, formally adopted her in 2023 — when she was around 21 — in a splashy event that made up part of the show’s second season.\n\nThe pressure to provide TV drama may have been too much for the Mans family, however. Despite caring for Natalia for nearly a decade without issues, they abruptly dramatically leaned into the “Natalia is evil” theme, with Antwon Mans calling the show’s producers to allege that her behavior had been disturbing and selfish. The ID producers, naturally, revealed this development as a shocking twist and a season-ending cliffhanger.\n\nIn the documentary’s third season, Natalia accused the Mans family of physical and emotional abuse. To the Hollywood Reporter, ID president Jason Sarlanis described the docuseries’ decision to delve into Natalia’s time with the Mans as “do[ing] right by our audience” — whether anyone considered doing right by Natalia and her new family dynamic was less clear.\n\nIn 2023, Natalia left the Mans family’s Nashville residence and moved in with yet another family: The DePauls, a family of little people who reportedly wanted to adopt Natalia all the way back in 2009, prior to her adoption by the Barnetts. The ID series filmed them helping Natalia dramatically “escape” from the Mans in the middle of the night, into a new wholesome life with a family who hopefully could finally understand her.\n\nA happy ending? Yes and no. While there’s little left to say about Natalia’s story at this point, it’s clearly going to keep going in the public eye. In January 2025, People placed now 23-year-old Natalia on the cover, with the lurid headline “Victim or Villain?” even though years of reporting within its own pages make the answer abundantly clear. Hulu’s Good American Family similarly plays with blaming a disabled child for her own abuse. On top of that, the show drags out over eight episodes and features a parade of flat, dull characters. Ellen Pompeo as Kristine is especially one-note, narcissistic and brittle with little nuance, while Mark Duplass as Michael goes through a histrionic and unbelievable series of emotional swings as he wrestles with who to believe. The Mans are depicted as well-meaning grifters who rescue Natalia but aren’t without their own issues.\n\nThough it ultimately fully accepts the framing that the Barnetts emotionally and physically abused and gaslit Natalia to a heartbreaking degree, it also initially perpetuates the idea that Natalia’s behavior is alarming and disturbing. Above all, casting 27-year-old Reid to play a child 20 years younger at the time the series starts does more to confuse the narrative than clarify it. While the narrative depicts Natalia as finding closure, it’s hard not to see the show leaving the door open for another season, just as ID has done again and again.\n\nWhat’s more, Nicole DePaul recently alleged on Facebook that the docudrama had not compensated Natalia in any way for the use of her story — though they were, she claimed, compensating Kristine Barnett, perhaps in the hopes of staving off a lawsuit. (Hulu did not respond for comment.)\n\n\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time that a high-profile true crime docudrama has been castigated for exploiting victims. But instead of learning any lessons from those other cases, or even from Natalia’s own story, it seems we’re destined to repeat these same mistakes in the quest for drama — with diminishing returns.",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court spent Wednesday morning giving very serious consideration to a case that no one should take seriously.\n\nFCC v. Consumers’ Research asks the justices to revive a long-dead legal doctrine known as “nondelegation,” which places strict limits on Congress’s authority to delegate power to federal agencies, and essentially move that power over to the judiciary. The problem with this legal doctrine, besides the difficulty it would create for agencies trying to carry out their mandates, is that it appears nowhere in the Constitution, and so it is impossible to come up with principled rules to guide when judges should strike down a law empowering an agency.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nThe Consumers’ Research case is also a strange vehicle to revive the Nondelegation Doctrine because the particular statute at issue in this case clearly should be upheld under the Court’s current nondelegation precedents. In fact, even if the Court were to abandon those precedents in favor of an alternative, more restrictive nondelegation framework that was proposed by Justice Neil Gorsuch in a 2019 dissent, the federal program at issue in Consumers’ Research should still be upheld.\n\nWhile all six of the Court’s Republicans showed sympathy with the broader project of expanding the Court’s power to overrule federal agencies, only three of them appeared likely to strike down the law that is actually at issue in Consumers’ Research. The Court’s opinion in this case could still have considerable long-term implications if it embraces Gorsuch’s proposed framework or otherwise expands the judiciary’s authority. But the statutory scheme that is before the justices right now seems likely to survive.\n\nSo what is at issue in this case?\n\nConsumers’ Research involves a program known as the Universal Service Fund, which provides telephone and internet service to rural areas and other regions that are difficult to wire. In the absence of this program, these services would be prohibitively expensive in many poorer or more sparsely populated regions of the country.\n\nRelated A new Supreme Court case seeks to revive one of the most dangerous ideas from the Great Depression\n\nThe Universal Service Fund effectively taxes telephone and internet service providers and uses that money to pay for service in these expensive areas. As a practical matter, that means service providers pass the cost of this tax onto their urban and suburban customers — so people in cities wind up subsidizing communications for people in rural communities.\n\nOne challenge Congress faced when it created this program is that the amount of money the Fund must raise to achieve universal service varies from year to year. So, rather than setting a precise annual tax rate for service providers, Congress tasked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with determining how much money the fund should collect.\n\nThe federal statute at issue in Consumers’ Research provides extraordinarily detailed instructions regarding how to make this determination. It only permits the FCC to subsidize services that are used by “a substantial majority of residential customers,” it instructs the FCC to raise enough money so that rural customers pay “reasonably comparable” rates to other customers, and it lays out numerous other principles which the FCC must follow.\n\nThus, the FCC should look at which communications services the overwhelming majority of Americans already have, and it should raise enough funds to ensure that rural customers pay similar rates to urban customers, without raising so much money that rural rates are significantly cheaper.\n\nUnder the Court’s current precedents, Congress must only provide an agency with an “intelligible principle” that it must follow when it exercises its authority, and there’s no serious argument that this statute fails this test.\n\nGorsuch’s dissent in Gundy v. United States (2019), which also concerned nondelegation, proposed a new and much vaguer rule — Congress must put “forth standards ‘sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts, and the public to ascertain’ whether Congress’s guidance has been followed” — but even under Gorsuch’s standard it is tough to make an argument that the Universal Service Fund is illegal.\n\nOnly three of the justices seemed to believe that the Universal Service Fund is illegal\n\nPerhaps for this reason, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested a completely novel way to invalidate the Fund. Thomas suggested that the nondelegation doctrine should apply with more force in taxing cases, limiting Congress’s power to determine how much a federal agency may raise.\n\nOne problem with Thomas’s approach, however, is that the Court held in Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co. (1989) that the Constitution does not “require the application of a different and stricter nondelegation doctrine in cases where Congress delegates discretionary authority to the Executive under its taxing power.” So reaching Thomas’s preferred result would require the Court to overrule Skinner.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, followed his typical practice of peppering the side that counters Republican orthodoxy with a series of unrelated questions, in the hopes that they would stumble over one of them — and he was joined in this tactic by Justice Gorsuch.\n\nOver the course of the argument, Alito and Gorsuch complained that the FCC created a corporation to advise it on how to set rates, that the taxing power can potentially be used to destroy companies, and that the FCC sought input from the same companies that they are taxing. At one point, Gorsuch went off on a strange tangent about how the government’s decision to break up “Ma Bell” in 1982 created other telephone monopolies.\n\nNone of these arguments are relevant to whether the Universal Service Fund is constitutional, at least under existing law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Court’s other Republicans asked some skeptical questions of the two lawyers who defended the Fund, but they ultimately seemed to conclude that this particular nondelegation challenge is unworkable.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, for example, did ask acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris how to distinguish between a tax and a “fee,” a question that suggests that Kavanaugh has some sympathy for Thomas’s position, but ultimately seemed satisfied with Harris’s response that this distinction is “unbelievably murky in practice.”\n\nSimilarly, while Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Harris to distinguish this law from other hypothetical laws that would raise more serious nondelegation questions, such as a law that merely instructed the IRS to raise enough money to provide “food for the needy,” she too seemed skeptical that this particular law is unconstitutional.\n\nNotably, Barrett threw cold water on Thomas’s suggestion that there should be a special rule for taxes. Congress, she noted, could potentially solve the problem by imposing a cap as high as $3 trillion on the Fund’s ability to raise money, but that would be an empty requirement that amounts to nothing more than throwing “out a number for the sake of throwing out a number.”\n\nIt appears, in other words, that the Republican justices’ general desire to expand the nondelegation doctrine — a desire that five of them have expressed openly at one point or another — is likely to run aground in the Consumers’ Research case because this case is such a poor vehicle to expand nondelegation. Congress’s instructions to the FCC were as detailed as they could possibly be, unless the Supreme Court wants to strip Congress of its ability to, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said, “provide a service, however much it costs.”\n\nThe Court could still use this case to seize power\n\nIt’s notable that, while even the Trump administration agrees that the Universal Service Fund is legal, the federal government switched its position in this case after Trump took office. The government’s initial brief, which was filed in the final two weeks of the Biden administration, argues that the Court should apply existing law and uphold the Fund. By contrast, its reply brief (a brief responding to the other side’s arguments) treats Gorsuch’s Gundy dissent as if it were the law. The reply brief was filed after Trump took office.\n\nEven if the Court upholds the Universal Service Fund, which seems likely, the Republican justices could still use this case to abandon the longstanding “intelligible principle” framework, which gives Congress a great deal of authority to delegate power to agencies, and replace it with Gorsuch’s “sufficiently definite and precise” framework. Because that later framework is so vague, a decision embracing Gorsuch’s approach would give judges far more discretion to strike down federal programs that they do not like.\n\nSo, even if the Court rejects the exceedingly weak attack on the law at issue in this case, it could still use this case to achieve a significant power grab. Gorsuch’s framework would transfer a great deal of power from federal agencies, which are controlled by an elected president, and toward a judiciary dominated by Republicans who serve for life. That would mean that the American people would have far less control over how they are governed.",

He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nA Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\n\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\n\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\n\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\n\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\n\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\n\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\nRelated Elon Musk and the age of shameless oligarchy\n\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\n\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\n\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\n\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.",

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nWhile Congress has long called for universal service for telecommunications and similar technology, there are practical obstacles to this goal, especially in rural areas that are far more expensive to wire because residents are more spread out. In these areas, if telephone and internet providers charged a fair market rate, their services could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nWhich is why Congress created the Universal Service Fund. It effectively taxes telephone and internet service providers, and uses that money to pay for service to underserved communities. As a practical matter, service providers pass the cost of these taxes on to their customers in urban and other cheap-to-serve areas, so Americans living in cities wind up subsidizing telephone and internet in more sparsely populated regions of the country.\n\nBecause the amount of money the Fund must raise to achieve universal service will vary from year to year, Congress also tasked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with determining how much money the Fund should collect from service providers each year. The statute also provides the FCC with detailed instructions on how to determine the amount it should collect, and how that money should be spent.\n\nThis program has hummed along without incident for nearly three decades — the Fund was created in 1996 — until the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit abruptly declared it unconstitutional. If you’re familiar with the Fifth Circuit’s work, you know that this kind of thing is common. The Fifth Circuit is the most right-wing appeals court in the federal system, and its judges often strike down decades-old laws based on unusually creative interpretations of the Constitution.\n\nRelated The Trumpiest court in America\n\nThe Supreme Court, despite its 6-3 Republican majority, hands down a few cases every year reversing these Fifth Circuit decisions. Last May, for example, the Court reversed the Fifth Circuit’s attempt to strike down an entire federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nNevertheless, the Consumers’ Research case is worth watching for two reasons. One is that the Fifth Circuit’s decision was authored by Judge Andy Oldham, a Trump appointee who is widely considered a strong candidate for promotion to the Supreme Court in this administration. Oldham’s opinions are often sloppy, and his opinion in Consumers’ Research is no exception.\n\nThe second is that Oldham relied on a legal doctrine known as “nondelegation” in his opinion targeting the Universal Service Fund. The nondelegation doctrine claims there are strict constitutional limits on Congress’s power to empower federal agencies to do all kinds of things, from limiting pollution from power plants, to setting minimum standards for health insurance, to, at least if Oldham gets his way, providing broadband to rural communities.\n\nThe Supreme Court has only invoked this doctrine twice, both times in 1935, to strike down a federal law, and its decisions since then hold that the doctrine is more or less dead. Still, five of the Republican justices have, at various times, advocated for reviving the nondelegation doctrine. So there is a real risk that the Court could use the Consumers’ Research case as a vehicle to do so.\n\nIf that happens, it would shift a simply enormous amount of power from the elected branches of government to the judiciary. And it could potentially strip the federal government of a whole lot more than its power to equalize telephone and internet rates.\n\nWhy are the stakes in Consumers’ Research so high?\n\nCongress frequently enacts laws which lay out a general policy, then task a federal agency with implementing that policy and determining how to achieve it. The law creating the Universal Service Fund, for example, lays out the broad goal of taxing communications service providers and using that money to ensure that everyone has access to those services. But it is also recognized that the amount of money that needs to be raised to achieve this goal, as well as the question of how that money should be distributed, is a moving target that needs to be periodically reassessed by the FCC.\n\nOther laws delegate authority to an agency because technology evolves, and agencies employ experts who can monitor that technology and update federal policy accordingly. The Clear Air Act, for example, declares that certain power plants should use the “best system of emission reduction” that currently exists, while also accounting for factors such as costs. Because Congress recognized that the best system in 2025 will be more advanced than the best system that existed in 1972, it also tasked the EPA with determining what that system is and updating federal power plant regulations so that those plants use modern technology.\n\nThe stakes in the Consumers’ Research case are mitigated somewhat because the Court’s Republican majority has already given itself the power to veto federal agency actions.\n\nThe idea behind the nondelegation doctrine is that the Constitution limits Congress’s power to delegate power to agencies in this way, but there’s a big problem with it: The doctrine appears nowhere in the Constitution itself, so judges who wish to apply it cannot refer to any text to determine which delegations of power are not allowed. If nondelegation were revived, the only real factor governing which congressional delegations are allowed, and which ones must be struck down, would be whether five justices wanted to strike a particular law down.\n\nMany right-leaning legal scholars have argued that this extraconstitutional doctrine is implicit in the Constitution, but it’s noteworthy that the people who actually wrote the Constitution disagreed with them. The First Congress made sweeping delegations of power to executive branch officials, giving them, among other things, the power to set regulations governing “all things touching” trade with Indigenous tribes, and the power to grant patents so long as they “deem the invention or discovery sufficiently useful or important.”\n\nAnd so the Supreme Court has historically treated the nondelegation doctrine with extraordinary suspicion. The Court did apply it twice, in 1935, to New Deal statutes which gave virtually unbounded power to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but it has never done so again. Supreme Court decisions stretching back nearly a century permit Congress to delegate authority to federal agencies, so long as Congress “lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.”\n\nThough the current Supreme Court has not, at least not yet, struck down a law on nondelegation grounds, it did invent a similar legal doctrine — which, like nondelegation, cannot be found in the Constitution itself — known as the “major questions doctrine.” Under this doctrine, a majority of the Court may veto any action by a federal agency which five justices believe to be too politically or economically significant.\n\nRelated How the Supreme Court put itself in charge of the executive branch\n\nSo the stakes in the Consumers’ Research case are mitigated somewhat because the Court’s Republican majority has already given itself the power to veto federal agency actions. But there’s also an important difference between major questions and nondelegation.\n\nUnder the major questions doctrine, the proper remedy, if five justices wish to veto an agency action, is to block that specific action — but to otherwise leave the federal law permitting the agency to act intact. The nondelegation doctrine, by contrast, often calls upon federal courts to toss out a statute delegating power to a federal agency altogether.\n\nBasically, the Court has already given itself the power to make a targeted strike on any individual agency action it doesn’t like, but it could use Consumers’ Research to carpet bomb agencies’ authority, stripping them of any power to act in the future.\n\nOldham’s Consumers’ Research opinion is extremely sloppy\n\nOne reason the justices might stay their hands in Consumers’ Research is that this case is a poor vehicle for reviving the nondelegation doctrine. The statute governing the Universal Service Fund provides detailed instructions to the FCC on how it should exercise its authority — far more detail than Congress provided in many other statutes that the Supreme Court has upheld against nondelegation challenges, including cases involving executive branch policy on navigable waters, natural gas rates, and commodity prices. Some of the statutes upheld by the Supreme Court do little more than instruct agencies to remove “unreasonable” obstacles to commerce.\n\nOldham should have followed these decisions, as he should have followed the Court’s precedents requiring him to uphold the Universal Service Fund statute so long as it provides an “intelligible principle” that the FCC can use to guide its decisions.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund statute lays out six goals that the FCC should accomplish, in its efforts to provide telecommunications access to rural and poor communities. It specifies who should be taxed (“Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute”), and who should benefit from this tax revenue. And it instructs the FCC on how to determine the rate of taxation.\n\nOne provision, for example, states that rural customers should receive service “at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.” Thus, the FCC must tax service providers at a high enough rate to ensure that rural customers pay similar rates to urban customers, but not at such a high rate that rural customers pay significantly less than urban customers.\n\nThere’s simply no question, in other words, that the Universal Service Fund statute provides an “intelligible principle” to guide the FCC’s decisions.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund would likely survive judicial review even under a more aggressive approach to nondelegation favored by some members of the Court. Dissenting in Gundy v. United States (2019), for example, Justice Neil Gorsuch proposed replacing the intelligible principle standard with a vague new rule providing that Congress must put “forth standards ‘sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts, and the public to ascertain’ whether Congress’s guidance has been followed” whenever it delegates power. Here, Congress has laid out definite and precise rules governing who the FCC should tax, how much it should tax them, and how that revenue should be spent.\n\nSo how, then, did Oldham justify striking down the Universal Service Fund? The answer is he took extraordinary liberties with the law, ignoring most of the statute, openly defying the Supreme Court’s decisions, and simply making up new rules along the way.\n\nAt one point, for example, Oldham claims that only two provisions of the statute are “relevant” to determining whether it violates the nondelegation doctrine — a provision stating that the FCC should raise funds “sufficient…to preserve and advance universal service,” and another provision indicating telecommunications services “should be available at…affordable rates.”\n\nIf these were the only instructions the statute provided to the FCC, then Consumers’ Research might be a more difficult case. But, of course, Congress said a whole lot more than these two things when it instructed the FCC on how to wield its authority.\n\nOldham also relies on a concurring opinion, by Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones, which the Supreme Court repudiated last spring. He places a simply enormous amount of weight on the fact that the FCC created a corporation, known as the Universal Service Administrative Company, which advises it on how to set Universal Service Fund rates. But the Supreme Court held in Sunshine Anthracite Coal v. Adkins (1940) that these sorts of advisory bodies are “unquestionably valid.”\n\nIt appears, in other words, that Oldham started with the result he wanted — striking down the Universal Service Fund — and then wrote an opinion pretending that the law actually supports his preferred outcome.\n\nSo how is the Supreme Court likely to approach this case?\n\nRealistically, it is unlikely that even this Supreme Court will strike down the Universal Service Fund. The statute is too detailed, and Oldham’s opinion is too nonsensically argued, to justify the result the Fifth Circuit wants to achieve.\n\nOne thing to watch out for, however, is whether the Republican justices attempt to shift the law governing nondelegation cases, while still upholding the Fund. The Court could, for example, write an opinion repudiating the intelligible principle test and upholding the Fund under Gorsuch’s “sufficiently definite and precise” standard — a standard that, because of its vagueness, would give judges far more discretion to strike down laws they do not like on nondelegation grounds.\n\nSo, while Oldham is unlikely to succeed in his ambitious attempt to sabotage the Fund, he may nonetheless achieve a significant victory. By ignoring the law in his Consumers’ Research opinion, Oldham gave the justices an opportunity to revive a dangerous legal doctrine, and to do so in an opinion that appears moderate compared to the reactionary Fifth Circuit.",

        "content": "is a correspondent at Vox, where he covers the impacts of social and economic policies. He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nThis story was originally published in The Highlight, Vox’s member-exclusive magazine. To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today.\n\nIn almost all ways, the Liberty Hotel in Boston is like any other swanky hotel. It hosts galas, weddings, and New Year’s Eve parties. It has weekly events like “Fashionably LATE Thursdays” — a show in the lobby that features “a who’s who of Boston’s fashion elite” — and “beat weekends,” where local DJs perform on Friday and Saturday nights. It’s a hotel, in other words, that strives to be a place where local residents can go to see and be seen.\n\nBut there’s one thing about the Liberty Hotel that’s markedly different from its peers: Not too long ago, it was a prison.\n\nUntil 1990, when it was still operating as the Charles Street Jail, it was a building that most people wanted to avoid. It was in disrepair and overcrowded, so much so that a US district court once declared that it violated people’s constitutional rights.\n\nThe hotel leans into that history — sometimes uncomfortably so. The place that once jailed suffragists and civil rights activists now boasts restaurants with names like “Clink” and “Alibi.” It relishes “playful nods to [its] infamous past” with decorations that include old keys. “Don’t worry, these days, the doors lock from the inside only,” its website reads. “But with rooms this luxurious, we can’t guarantee that you’ll ever want to leave.”\n\nThat transformation from jailhouse to hotel fundamentally changed how people interacted with the building. It also uncovered an uncomfortable truth: Prisons and jails don’t fit into their surrounding neighborhoods. As a hotel, the former Charles Street Jail draws in crowds; as a jail, it repelled passersby, who probably tried their best to ignore its existence.\n\nWhat our prisons look like says a lot about how we think about crime and punishment, what we think about prisoners, and how we like to think of our own society.\n\nThat’s never going to change. Prisons will always be a place that people would rather not think about, and residents will likely protest anytime one gets built in their neighborhood. So, as long as prisons and jails continue to exist, architects and urban planners must face the question of what a prison should look like. Should it be tucked away or built on an island like Rikers or Alcatraz? If it’s in an urban neighborhood, should it be made invisible by blending into its surroundings, or should it stand out to send a message about criminal justice?\n\nThese questions aren’t just hypothetical. A few months ago, city officials in Washington, DC, released renderings for a new jail that’s meant to replace the city’s current, crumbling correctional facility. ​​A senior vice president of the design firm hired by the city was frank with their intent. “The community doesn’t want to see a jail,” she said in a public meeting in November. With that in mind, they put together a design that would fit into the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nThe proposal — which included steel panels obscuring a glass exterior — drew mixed reactions, according to the Washington Post. Some noted that it’s clear the designers were trying to create a welcoming environment that offered, at the very least, a dignified experience for those unfortunate enough to go through its doors. Others pointed out that, despite the designers’ efforts, it still looked somewhat menacing. “It presents as a cage,” said one member of the US Commission of Fine Arts, one of the bodies responsible for approving the project.\n\nUltimately, what a prison looks like on the outside has seemingly little to do with the conditions on the inside. But questions of design get at something deeper: What our prisons look like says a lot about how we think about crime and punishment, what we think about prisoners, and how we like to think of our own society.\n\nThe prison architect’s dilemma\n\nMany factors contribute to what a prison ends up looking like — including city planning, community input, and stakeholder needs — but who designs it has the biggest say. The problem for many architects, though, is that while they can influence what a prison looks like inside and out, their job ends there. What happens afterward, within the walls they helped erect, is out of their control. And because the criminal justice system is riddled with injustice — from racial bias to harsh prison conditions — some architects believe that they shouldn’t participate in the system at all.\n\nIn 2020, the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) issued a statement discouraging its members from designing places of incarceration until the American justice system is reformed so that the law can be applied without racial bias. “We instead urge our members to shift their efforts towards supporting the creation of new systems, processes, and typologies based on prison reform, alternatives to imprisonment, and restorative justice,” the statement said.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2010, the prison and jail population in the United States grew from roughly 500,000 people to nearly 2.3 million. The number of correctional facilities also grew by 43 percent between 1990 and 2005, from 1,277 to 1,821. So by participating in the process of building more prisons, architects have a hand in maintaining a system of mass incarceration. “That means that we’re building more prisons to lock more people up. You can’t tell me that’s not an architectural issue,” Bryan C. Lee Jr., an architect and founder of the nonprofit firm Colloqate Design, told Architect Magazine in 2021. “For nearly every injustice in this world, there’s an architecture, a plan, a design that has been built to sustain it.”\n\nBut without architects providing thoughtful or compassionate design ideas, prisons can become the worst version of themselves — a concrete box that offers nothing but the bare minimum.\n\nIt’s often the case, for instance, that older prisons aren’t just in disrepair, but also lack basic facilities that could make the inside a more suitable environment for preparing people for life after they’re released. “A lot of people that I work with, or work for, have a lot of great ideas of the way they would like to have programs and so forth, and their old buildings are the biggest hurdle,” said Jeff Goodale, director of the global civic and justice group at the architecture firm HOK, referring to rehabilitative programs like one-on-one counseling or group therapy. Some prisons, for example, don’t have enough rooms that are conducive to that kind of programming. “Putting them in a new facility that actually is designed to enable those programs — we’ve seen it make a big difference,” Goodale added.\n\nAs a result, architects like Goodale hope that their role in designing prisons will help create a more just and humane system.\n\n“My viewpoint is that the role that the facility plays is not meant to exert additional punitive measures,” he said. “The goal, from my perspective, is that whatever has landed somebody in this position, that there’s an opportunity here in this facility then to actually start a road to recovery, whether that’s addressing addiction or mental health issues, that we want to create an atmosphere where dedicated professionals can interact with them and start that process. That’s why I’m in it.”\n\nThe case for better prison design\n\nIt is undeniable that the way prisons are designed has a major impact on how they’re run. The popular 18th century-era panopticon design, for example, emphasized surveillance and control, pointing all prison cells towards a central rotunda from where they could be easily observed. The Charles Street Jail, a cruciform structure that gave the warden a central view of the cells and the ability to isolate prisoners from one another, also influenced a lot of prison design across the United States since it was built in 1851, according to the Boston Landmark Commission.\n\nThose models, seen as signs of prison reform at the time they were popularized, are still sometimes perceived to be good architectural examples. “Most architects think that the panopticon is still an active and legitimate model, which is just absurd because on day one it was wrong and it produced a lot of harm,” said Frank Greene, vice president and architecture chief at STV, an architecture, engineering and construction management firm. “Those radial plan buildings, they’re not safe because people are locked in their cells all day, which is incredibly damaging. … All the bad things that have been going on in prisons for a very long time are very much a result of the architecture.”\n\nThere’s a stark contrast between how old prisons were designed and newer urban facilities. “Old School jails, particularly 19th-century jails and prisons, were designed to be intimidating, to be symbols of authority, using heavy masonry, fortress-like windows, little slit windows, to communicate this sense of being impregnable. “You can’t break in, you can’t break out,” Greene said. “A modern jail, one that’s humane, sustainable, [with] trauma-informed design and all of that, should present as a normal building — no little slit windows, no razor ribbon, no harsh lighting on the outside — something that presents with an environment around it that are public spaces that normal people can use, that become assets to the community.”\n\nSo while opting out of participating in an unfair criminal justice system is certainly a valid position for architects to take, it’s also hard to ignore the fact that the role they play can have consequentially positive impacts on the people inside. So long as we still have prisons, without architects thinking through how a prison’s design can lead to better outcomes for mental health, programming, and overall conditions, then the criminal justice system as a whole would be demonstrably worse: It would not only be unfair in the sense of who it churns in and out, but it would also be more punishing for the people under its supervision.\n\nHow to build a good prison\n\nThere’s no definitive manual for designing decent prisons, but it’s clear what elements make for a better, more humane design.\n\nThe first factor to consider is location. As uncomfortable as the presence of prisons and jails can be for some residents, it’s important to keep them close to the community. The further they are, the more intimidating they are, the more likely people are to think of prisoners as people who are unworthy of dignity or respect.\n\nThe prison complex on Rikers Island in New York City, for example, literally removes incarcerated people from the city and places them out of sight on an island in the East River. For decades, the prison had been rife with controversies of abuse, neglect, and poor conditions. So in 2019, the city approved a plan to finally shut down that sprawling, remote facility and replace it with several smaller and more integrated prisons in the city’s four most populous boroughs.\n\nNew prisons and jails should consider design principles that would make living in them, however temporarily, as bearable and undisruptive as possible by focusing on creating rehabilitative conditions. They should adhere to the same principles that would make apartment buildings or, say, assisted living facilities more appealing. Prisons, in other words, should look normal. More natural lighting and big windows with views of nature, for example, can positively affect people’s moods. And where the facility sits, and how it interacts with the outside community, can give people in detention greater access to the outside world. “It should be welcoming,” Greene said, adding that it could promote more visits from family, friends, and other support networks.\n\n“The welcoming piece really applies to volunteers and social service providers,” Greene added. “I was just astounded at the number of volunteers that go all the way out to Rikers Island, with all the time it takes to just simply get on the island.”\n\nHe mentioned how one yoga instructor travels three hours to get to Rikers Island to give classes to inmates — something that would be much more doable if prisons and jails were more integrated into our neighborhoods instead of being shunned to hard-to-reach (or hard-to-see) places.\n\nIncarcerated people “shouldn’t be othered. They shouldn’t lose the right to vote. They shouldn’t lose the right to be able to live in public housing or to be able to get a barber license, and all the silly things that we do to felons. We really should give them second chances and embrace them,” Greene said. “They’re still one of us, they’re still family, literally or figuratively, and we need to help people when they come out and give them that second chance.”\n\nLastly, when it comes to the exterior, the more ominous and opaque prisons are, the more likely you are to suspect they are purely a place of torment and punishment — as though the government is telling you to look away.\n\nGoodale has spent decades planning and designing correctional facilities. “From the outside we really want to portray a better sense of transparency. When you think about some of the older facilities, they’re very opaque, people have a sense they don’t know what’s going on behind the walls sometimes. We want to really turn that inside out,” Goodale said. “Even though we’re not making everything transparent necessarily, we want to at least move more in that direction — that the building is transparent, and therefore that transparency makes the activities and so forth less shrouded in secrecy.”\n\nIt’s true that what matters most about prisons and jails is how good the conditions and services they provide are. But how they’re designed, how they look to the outside world, isn’t immaterial. These buildings not only reflect how the public feels about prisoners, but can help inform those opinions as well. A remote or intimidating structure might reinforce the idea that prisoners should not be considered part of our society, whereas a more integrated and welcoming building promotes the opposite message.\n\nUltimately, there might not be a clear answer to what, exactly, a prison should look like on the outside. While legislative buildings, town squares, and libraries can embody our society’s greatest ideals of democracy, openness, and education, prisons represent an uglier reality.\n\nPrisons are, at the end of the day, inherently complicated structures. For some, they’re a reminder of horrible crimes that have been committed. For others, they represent a deeply flawed, discriminatory criminal justice system that harms more people than it helps. Perhaps the most enticing ideal we should strive for is to create a society in which prisons no longer exist. But so long as they do, it’s best to reform them with an eye toward healing, not punishing — humanizing, and not othering. And that all starts with how we choose to design them.",

To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today.\n\nWhen was the last time you felt utterly, stupefyingly, mind-numbingly bored? It might’ve been when you languished in the waiting room at a doctor’s office for 10 minutes too long. Or you felt your eyes glaze over in the middle of a philosophy class. Perhaps it was on a never-ending drive wherein your toddler insisted on hearing the same song over and over and over again. Maybe you are exceedingly bored right now (in which case, I’m sorry, and I hope to recapture your attention).\n\nBoredom is a common occurrence in the ebb and flow of life. It’s usually marked by a feeling of restlessness and agitation, says James Danckert, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Waterloo and the co-author of Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom. A hunch that you must get out of here immediately.\n\nRelated How to be alone with your thoughts\n\nThere is a functional aspect to boredom, though. The emotion is motivating, meant to spur you to action: This thing you’re doing is not fulfilling or meaningful, so go find something else that is. Some are better at listening to that alarm than others, Danckert says, and those who say they never get bored are probably more skilled at dealing with it. Those who respond productively to the messages boredom sends have the power to make changes in their lives, big and small, which is great for you and bad for boredom. “Boredom doesn’t do the hard work of telling you what to do,” Danckert says. “It just tells you you need to do something else.” It’s up to you to figure out what that is.\n\nA desire for something different\n\nWhile you’ve surely experienced boredom at some point or another, have you stopped to consider why? Erin Westgate, an assistant professor of social psychology at the University of Florida who studies boredom, defines the feeling as one in which we don’t want to or can’t engage with what we’re doing, either because we lack the attention to do it — because the task is too easy or too difficult — or it lacks meaning. Boredom can strike momentarily — the impossibility of focusing while reading a dense book, for instance — or it can take root over a longer period of time, such as when you find yourself working an unfulfilling job.\n\n“Boredom doesn’t do the hard work of telling you what to do. It just tells you you need to do something else.”\n\nBoredom can be fairly universal: Few find waiting in line at the DMV a particularly riveting experience. But it is individual, too. A movie you consider engrossing may be a snooze to another viewer. This is why some people find being alone with their thoughts excruciating, while others revel in mind wandering, Westgate says. Sitting with your inner monologue absent other distractions is not equivalent to being bored, at least not for everyone. However, it can be boring if you don’t particularly enjoy solitude.\n\nAnother common misconception: “People often conflate boredom with not having anything to do,” Westgate says. On the contrary, if your day consists of monotonous, repetitive tasks, you may not have much downtime but feel bored. The uber-busy who claim to crave boredom may in fact be yearning for quiet contendedness, a moment to relax.\n\nIt’s true that filling your days with constant activities and entertainment may prevent you from getting bored in the first place. While this doesn’t necessarily seem like a bad thing, if you’re constantly masking boredom with another podcast or just one more episode, “you are preventing yourself from knowing when you’ve gone off track from what you value and what you care about and what you can give to the world,” Westgate says.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

Those who see being bored as an impediment and frustration tend to be bored more often, says Wijnand Van Tilburg, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Essex. On the contrary, those who see boredom as an inevitability of life get less bored and, when they do, cope with it more effectively.\n\nAnd despite anecdotal evidence that says otherwise, boredom doesn’t lead to inspired breakthroughs and increased creativity, research shows. Instead, it’s the moderately engaging activities, like showering or taking a walk, that actually lead to inspiration. The shower or the walk is neither so engrossing or boring as to distract your thoughts from churning — that’s the sweet spot you should be aiming for.\n\nMaking the most of boredom\n\nSo how can you better deal with boredom when it strikes? How can you adequately decode what your boredom is signaling?\n\nWhen the feeling does arise, use it as a reminder that what you’re doing isn’t meaningful and to seek out something that is, experts say. This will differ depending on the context. You might pop in a podcast while folding laundry to help make the chore feel less like drudgery. Perhaps you could head to YouTube to find a bread-making tutorial on a dreary afternoon. “It doesn’t really matter what it is,” Danckert says, “but you have to deem it to be valid and worth doing.”\n\nFor circumstances where you’re unable to up and leave, such as school or work, Westgate suggests trying to make the experience more profound. “Focus on why am I here and what’s the deeper purpose it’s serving so that the experience feels more meaningful,” she says.\n\nDespite anecdotal evidence to the contrary, boredom doesn’t lead to inspired breakthroughs and increased creativity.\n\nOr maybe you’re growing impatient on a long road trip: Try to find challenges or ways to make the situation more stimulating. Car games exist for a reason. Or make up your own. “My brother and I, growing up, used to play this game called ‘Who would you ask for help?’” Westgate says. “In this room right now, if you had to pick one person to ask for help, who would it be and why?”\n\nOf course, the solution to a soul-crushingly boring job might be to find another one that gives your life more meaning and purpose. Since this isn’t exactly easy or realistic for many people, Danckert suggests reframing your current employment situation: You’re not living to work, you’re working to live. That is, your job gives you money which allows you to do meaningful activities in your free time.\n\nFor more short-term boredom, like waiting in line for a sandwich, Westgate says there’s nothing wrong with using your phone as entertainment to pass the time. “If looking at your phone is a form of distraction for a few minutes, that lets you stick with that boring, uncomfortable activity that you still need to do, that’s probably fine,” she says. “I think the problem becomes when that is our response to all boredom.”\n\nIf you’re using your phone as a crutch every time you feel the slightest whisper of boredom, you may develop some unhealthy habits — like scrolling on the sidelines at your kid’s soccer game or while driving. In fact, constantly scrolling through short videos, like on TikTok, increases boredom, a study found. “It reduces attention capacity, it reduces perceptions of meaning in one’s activity,” Van Tilburg says. It “increases boredom, even though people think that doing so will help alleviate it.”\n\nInstead of using your devices as a boredom security blanket, Van Tilburg suggests getting more comfortable breaking it up in myriad, tangible ways, like striking up a conversation while in line for coffee or creating phone-free areas at home (like the bedroom and bathroom). Try to embrace mind wandering instead of fearing silence.\n\nBoredom is a lot like goldilocks: You shouldn’t avoid it completely, but too much of it isn’t good either. Life doesn’t need to be a monotonous fog, nor is it supposed to be perpetually rapturously engaging.",

        "content": "is a news editor with Vox’s politics and policy team. He’s helped cover elections, Congress, and both the Biden and Trump administrations. Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\n\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\n\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

        "content": "This story was originally published in The Highlight, Vox’s member-exclusive magazine. To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today.\n\nFor millennials everywhere, two of the most glamorous and terrifying fashionistas of the 2000s were the hosts of TLC’s What Not to Wear, Stacy London and Clinton Kelly. London’s Cruella streak of white hair, Kelly’s herringbone suits — the polish! The fabulousness! The way they would cackle over a hapless victim’s mom jeans and dated ’80s perm before literally throwing their whole wardrobe in the garbage — well, the meanest eighth-grader you know would have to work hard to be that scary.\n\nWhat was most compelling of all about London and Kelly, though, was the idea that they could actually tell you what not to wear: that there were real, rigid rules to fashion, and you could learn them, if you paid close enough attention. You could learn to wear what was appropriate for your age, your profession, your physique; to draw attention away from the largest part of your body and toward the smallest; to put together a sensible blazer with a business casual wrap dress, no matter the occasion.\n\nWhat Not to Wear ended in 2013 after 10 years on the air, and Kelly and London have both since distanced themselves from the brand. Last summer, however, they announced that they would be reuniting to host a new show on Amazon Prime, one far removed from the peak of 2000s body shaming: Wear Whatever the F You Want.\n\n“The world has changed a lot since the run of ‘What Not to Wear’, and, thankfully, so have we. These days, we have zero interest in telling people what to do, based on society’s norms — because there are no more norms!” they said in a press release. “It’s time to celebrate individual style, not prescribe it.”\n\nSomehow, the ethos London and Kelly were trying to broadcast for their new show has become the prevailing attitude in the style advice world now. Celebrating individual style, rather than prescribing it, is the new imperative. The phrase that people — or at least the thousands of influencers who have supplanted fashion’s usual gatekeepers over the last 20 years — usually use is “finding your personal style,” and they seed it liberally in the titles of TikToks and YouTube videos and Instagram reels. As in: “Outfits I wore before I found my personal style,” “Ted talk on personal style,” “How to find your personal style.”\n\nIt felt as inaccessible as the idea that I could theoretically make a mid-career pivot to acting and win an Oscar.\n\nI first started seeing the phrase everywhere around 2021, just as we were emerging from pandemic lockdowns, and it felt like stumbling across a mystical and arcane concept: that my personal style existed somewhere out there, independent of my conscious mind, and all I had to do was get in touch with the tools I needed to find it.\n\nFashion-wise, I am what the kids would call a normie. I am rarely sloppy, but I frequently feel that my clothes could look better. Imagining that I could have a sense of my own style so precise and specific that I could describe it with words, could know at a glance if an article of clothing belonged to it — well, it felt as inaccessible as the idea that I could theoretically make a mid-career pivot to acting and win an Oscar. Sure, it’s technically physically possible, but what are the odds?\n\nNonetheless, I was intrigued. The discussion about finding your personal style comes with such intriguing promises. The TikTok influencers and YouTube vloggers say discovering yours will save you from falling victim to trends and the accusations of basicness that come with them. It will save you from wasting your money on clothes that you don’t like, or from contributing to the mountains of lightly used textiles that clog landfills. It’s an idea that I find profoundly seductive — and, because it is so seductive, I also find myself profoundly suspicious of it.\n\nWhen did we all get so obsessed with personal style, anyway?\n\nAt the outset of this decade, as fast fashion and TikTok converged, the trend cycle started to move very fast indeed. An abbreviated list of the styles that have risen and fallen and perhaps risen again in the last few years: pleated skirts, mini skirts, midi skirts; cardigans, ladyjackets, puffer jackets, trench coats; prairie dresses, maxi dresses, shift dresses; high-waisted pants, low-rise jeans, barrel cuts, boot cuts, flared trousers; tucked-in sweaters, crop tops, bralettes; lug-soled loafers, knee-high boots, platform shoes, gladiator sandals, etc., etc.\n\nPart of the reason the idea of finding your personal style gained such currency is that it presents an antidote to this impossibly frenetic cycle. “It bubbled up first for me on TikTok and social media,” says Rachel Tashjian, fashion critic for the Washington Post. “People would say, ‘Okay, I’m getting really fed up with all of these micro trends.’ The reaction to that is to say, ‘Don’t follow these trends, but instead find your personal style.’”\n\nOne of those making the argument that it’s both more personally fulfilling and sustainable to get off the trend treadmill is Alyssa Beltempo, a slow fashion stylist and YouTube content creator. “When you know what you love, it’s a lot harder to be swayed by what’s new and what’s trending,” Beltempo says. What she means is that when you have a sense of taste divorced from the trend of the hour, you will be less tempted to buy a $20 polyester ruched milkmaid dress from Shein the next time cottagecore fashion blows up on TikTok, wear it once, and then throw it out.\n\nBody-positive stylist Dacy Gillespie, who runs the popular fashion substack Unflattering, theorizes that the movement toward body positivity itself has played a role in the social shift that has people reexamining what they want from their clothes. If we’re able to put on our clothes without demanding they make us look as thin as possible, Gillespie argues, many new possibilities open up before us.\n\n“I see that a lot of people are thinking more about self-expression versus what’s ‘flattering’ or what we should wear,” Beltempo says. “Both worlds do still exist, but there’s definitely been a shift.”\n\nOr maybe there’s a more pragmatic explanation for the big shift in how we talk about clothes: the rise of stretchy fabrics like Lycra and Spandex.\n\n“It’s almost as dramatic as when they got rid of corsets.” — David Kibbe, personal stylist behind Kibbe image identities\n\n“In the old days, the silhouette was structured outside the body,” says David Kibbe, the personal stylist behind the hugely internet-famous phenomenon of Kibbe image identities. “A silhouette usually came from Paris, and it would change about once a decade” — hence the iconic ’40s shoulder pads and ’50s nipped-in waists.\n\nThen came the ’80s, when new technology began to make it possible for fabric to stretch around the natural form of the body, rather than build new shapes on top of it. Today, nearly all clothes are made from lightweight and stretchy fabric, and the silhouette is no longer swapped out once a decade by Parisian designers. Instead, it’s the product of the way an individual piece of clothing drapes around an individual body. “That changes everything,” Kibbe says. “It’s almost as dramatic as when they got rid of corsets.”\n\nNow, says Tashjian, fashion designers who used to issue edicts on what people should wear are beginning to talk about their work as being in service to the creative vision of the consumer.\n\n“I was really shocked to hear designers backstage talking about, ‘It’s really not about what I’m creating. It’s about giving these things to women, and they can put them together in interesting ways,’” Tashjian says. “We’re used to thinking of designers as dictators.”\n\nChanges in fabric technology made it possible for consumers to think about clothes in new ways, focusing on their own desires instead of the choices of a designer. Social media made it possible to talk about those thoughts in large groups. A growing progressive ethos of environmentalism and body positivity made it ever-more attractive to cultivate your own style. Now, it’s all that seems to matter when it comes to clothes.\n\nThe warring philosophies of style\n\nWhen I first started paying attention to the idea of personal style, it was toward the end of the Covid lockdowns. I wasn’t entirely sure how I wanted to dress, but when I looked at my old closet full of prim business casual dresses I thought: “Not this.”\n\nI wanted to know what looked good on my body. I wanted to not care if I looked thin. I wanted to feel fresh and modern. I wanted to not get bogged down in trends. I wanted lots of clothes that were new and exciting. I wanted to not spend my money on fast fashion. I wanted to answer to no one, and I wanted someone to explain clearly to me how everyone was dressing these days so that I would know what the benchmark was.\n\nLike many people who like clothes, rules, and esoteric theory, I found what felt like a possible answer to my impossible problem with Kibbe styling, invented by Kibbe and immortalized by his first book Metamorphosis in 1987.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the Kibbe system has become the organizing principle for a thriving internet subculture with subreddits and Facebook groups and TikTok videos — to no one’s surprise as much as Kibbe himself, who says he found out about his fan base when one of his clients told him he should search his name on Facebook. Now, it’s popular enough that Kibbe has released an updated and revised take on his system, David Kibbe’s Power of Style.\n\nKibbe’s system has a quasi-mystical allure partially because it’s so befuddling to figure out; it’s a little like diving deep into astrology. It contains ten image archetypes, and you sort yourself into them based on the way fabric drapes around your body. If it falls in straight, vertical folds, you are Dramatic; if it skims over you in lush, round curves, you are Romantic; if you fall somewhere in between, there’s a different type out there for you. Each type, in turn, gets recommended a different style vibe based on Old Hollywood archetypes. Regal Dramatics are supposed to look best in structured tailoring, like Lauren Bacall, whereas dreamy Romantics are supposed to look best in soft-edged, flowing clothes, like Marilyn Monroe.\n\nKibbe also sorts his clients into color seasons to figure out which colors look best on them — warm vs. cool, soft vs. bright. By the time his process is finished, the theory goes, you know exactly what shapes and colors flatter you, and you can ignore everything that doesn’t. In a marketplace thrown into hyperdrive by fast fashion, that’s an attractive idea.\n\nRelated How Kibbe body types became an internet obsession\n\n“Personal style is hard to find,” says Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic at the New York Times. “Being conscious of it opens up a whole bunch of questions that you then have to ask yourself about how you’re presenting yourself and why you’re presenting yourself that way and how you feel every morning. That takes time, and then you can start getting neurotic about whether you’re doing it wrong. So offering guidelines like seasons and shapes and all that is a way to kind of take some of the neurosis or the insecurity out of it.”\n\nI am naturally skeptical of body typing systems, but I liked that Kibbe doesn’t seem to particularly care about making anyone look skinny. He talks a lot about “honoring” the unique attributes of each type, about making broad shoulders look broader and tall frames look taller.\n\nKibbe’s system has a quasi-mystical allure partially because it’s so befuddling to figure out; it’s a little like diving deep into astrology.\n\nAfter I found out about the system, I spent months squinting neurotically at people’s shoulders, trying to teach myself to see the attribute Kibbe describes as “width.” Eventually, after looking back and forth enough times between my own shoulders and Carole Lombard’s, I determined that I was a Soft Natural, the same group in which Kibbe has hilariously placed such disparate figures as Jennifer Lopez, Helen Mirren, and Kamala Harris.\n\nFinding my Kibbe type was a profoundly gratifying exercise, not least because a lot of the clothes he recommended for Soft Naturals were trending at the time. If my bias-cut slip dresses and slouchy cropped cardigans were sending a message, the message said that I was young, lived in a city, and knew what looked good on me.\n\nYet at the same time, I felt ambivalent about the idea of fixating on specific parts of my body, even if it was just to figure out the best ways to show them off, and on the idea of making my clothes “flattering,” which after all is still most often code for making yourself look as skinny as possible. There probably existed, I felt, some way of engaging with style that was more intellectual, purely about what you are drawn to aesthetically — so the real deprogramming could begin. The body positive and body neutral parts of the internet seemed like a good place to start.\n\n“When I work with clients, we spend one entire hour just talking about their relationship to clothes over the course of their lives, starting with when they were young and when they got messages about what they should wear,” says Gillespie, the body positive stylist. “It’s often body related.” You could make a whole career out of teaching people to drop all the racist, misogynistic baggage we’re all carrying around with our clothes.\n\nEven people in supposedly “ideal” bodies will probably remember being told that there were certain clothes that wouldn’t work on them. But our culture has a particularly specific slew of rules for fat people: telling them not to wear horizontal stripes that could make them look wider, or bright colors that make them stand out, or tight clothes that cling to their flesh. One of Gillespie’s goals is to help her clients learn to tune that advice out, and then figure out how to make their aesthetic dreams practical, to “translate it into something that works for them in the society that we live in.”\n\nGillespie points me to the example of the conventional advice for a pear-shaped person — wear fitted clothes on top that cinch the waist, and something looser and flowier on the bottom. “If you just think of that silhouette in your mind, that’s such a girly feminine silhouette. What if that’s not your vibe?” Gillespie asks. “What if you love an oversized androgynous look or something? To me that’s a really good explanation of how dressing to flatter your body could completely derail you from listening to what you actually want to wear.”\n\nIt’s for this reason that Gillespie is inherently suspicious of stylists like Kibbe. Kibbe, meanwhile, sees no point in counting the shape of your body out of the equation when you’re getting dressed, any more than he would count out the weight of the fabric.\n\n“Everything comes down to self love and ultimately self acceptance,” Kibbe told me. “I absolutely think you should love what you wear. That’s really important.” Still, he adds, if you want to make that androgynous silhouette that you love work on your body, you have to understand the rules of how fabric interacts with your actual, physical shape. Effect relies on technique, and without it, “then that fantasy stays in your head. So I believe in integration, the inner and the outer.”\n\nThere’s a third school of thought here, however, that doesn’t just think about style as a form of art and expression, but as a form of cultural communication. Clothes come with context, and we rely on them to tell strangers things about us.\n\nDerek Guy, a menswear blogger and social media power user, argues that having good style means understanding the cultural rules of clothing as though it is a grammar. For Guy, using systems like Kibbe’s to guide your dress choices can mean making nonsense out of your clothes’ cultural grammar, especially in the rigidly codified world of menswear. (“I don’t know anything about womenswear,” he says as a caveat.)\n\nTake, for instance, the practice of men wearing gray or navy suits to the office if they work in traditional fields like law and finance. “That’s because of the legacy of British cultural practices: gray and navy were worn in the office in London to do business, and brown and olive were worn in the country for sport,” Guy says.\n\nThis practice clashes with the seasonal color system Kibbe and other color analysts use, under which gray and navy are cool-toned colors that only people with cool-toned skin should wear. I myself am a warm autumn, which means I would need to seek out olive or brown businesswear — which, according to Guy, may not “convey the seriousness of business.” (Truly news we can use in digital media, where people regularly take meetings in their sweatpants.)\n\n“To me, all these ideas of dressing for your skin tone and body type are essentially trying to make what is cultural language seem like some type of pseudo-scientific endeavor, when it’s really culture that drives how we dress,” Guy says.\n\nSkinny jeans and the trend paradox\n\nEven after all that deep diving into style systems, even being careful to ignore the microtrends and TikTok core of the week, I couldn’t get away from the sense that every time I got dressed, I was still being pushed and buffeted by something outside of myself. I found a pair of skinny jeans from 2016 in the back of a drawer and could not stop staring at them, at how wrong they looked to me, how fundamentally incorrect. I could not believe I had ever worn anything so tight, so constricting around the ankles.\n\nYet I had worn such jeans on an almost daily basis for almost a decade and thought nothing of it. Why did they look so wrong now? Had I gotten so in touch with my own aesthetic preferences that I now realized I had never really liked them? Did they clash with the lines of my Soft Natural body? Were they speaking a cultural language I wasn’t interested in? Or was it simply that even after all that work, my sense of style was still under the control of the great cultural tide of trends?\n\nGuy’s take is that if you understand the cultural language of your pants, you can still pull off skinny jeans just fine. He points to the model and stylist Wisdom Kaye, who has been posting videos of himself rocking the now-reviled skinny jean to social media.\n\n“If you look at the outfits that he’s creating, what do they all rely on in terms of social language? Well, they all are relying on this rock’n’roll aesthetic,” Guy says. “So if your aesthetic inspiration is 1970s and ’80s rock ’n’ roll guys, you’re obviously not going to wear really wide leg pants, because that’s not the look. You’re going to wear skinny jeans. Side zip boots, flannels, black leather jackets. … That’s the look that was created through social history and will continue to be cool, because that’s the look of the Ramones, of Sid Vicious. The way that it goes bad is when guys start to wear skinny chinos with an office shirt.”\n\nIn contrast, Kibbe argues for paying attention to trends to a certain extent, and then interpreting them in a way that works for your image identity. “There should never be a subservience of style to trend or to fashion,” he says. “You should use those things in service of your star.” Then he added in slightly enigmatic tones, “A rosebud is very beautiful, but it is most beautiful of all when it’s in bloom.”\n\nGillespie, meanwhile, suggests looking at the problem of skinny jeans through the practical lens of your own life. “I will always try and encourage people to think about, if you’re feeling pressured to give your skinny jeans up: Why do you like them?” she says. “Do they serve a special function for you? For whatever reason, do you like having fabric close to your legs? Do you bike to work? Then I want you to consider all those things, and then reject the idea that says that skinny jeans look wrong, because you’re making that decision for yourself.”\n\nOn the other hand, is there anything more banal than not feeling like an individual in 2025? The vloggers and Substackers who talk about personal style all the time are full of this complaint. “It’s like it should be in a science fiction novel,” says Tashjian of the plethora of essays on this subject. “How is it that I’m reading over and over again, in some instances word for word, ‘It’s so hard to be an individual these days.’ And then you scroll a little bit: ‘It’s getting increasingly difficult to be an individual these days.’”\n\nTo be completely yourself: That is the fantasy of finding your style. To exist within the whole bizarre structure of fashion — all those billionaires deciding what you should wear, all those marketers deciding how you should feel about your one human body, all those materials that will lie next to your skin for some days and then rot forever in a landfill, all those people who will see you every day and make their assumptions about you based on how you look — and to feel that you’ve got some agency while you’re in there.\n\nBut the endless grind of capitalism has a way of turning all criticisms about our overconsumption into a new way of selling you things. If one of the weaknesses of our current fashion marketplace is that it’s hawking you trendy plastic clothes you would not otherwise want and will soon have to discard, and the way out is to get in touch with your own aesthetic desires — well, there are ways to monetize that journey, too.",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he covers ideology and challenges to democracy, both at home and abroad. His book on democracy,, was published 0n July 16. You can purchase it here.\n\nAt around 5:15 pm on Tuesday, a man in a black hoodie stopped Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk on the street in Somerville, Massachusetts. She tried to walk by, but he grabbed her. She screamed, and it seemed like help was arriving.\n\nBut the masked newcomers were actually there to help her assailant. They took off Ozturk’s backpack and seized her cellphone. The hooded man put her in handcuffs. “We’re the police,” they told her.\n\n“You don’t look like it,” an apparent bystander replied. “Why are you hiding your faces?”\n\nOzturk, a Turkish national on a student visa, is currently being held in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Louisiana — despite a court order that she must remain in Massachusetts. The State Department has canceled Ozturk’s visa; ICE is preparing her deportation.\n\nThe Trump administration claims she has engaged in “pro-Hamas” activity, but they have provided no evidence of material support for Palestinian militants (or any other terrorist group). The closest thing anyone has found is a 2024 op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper, in which Ozturk and her co-authors criticize Israel’s war in Gaza but do not express anything that even approximates support for Hamas.\n\nThis troubling theory — that Ozturk was punished purely for her political speech — received more support during a Thursday afternoon press conference, when Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that his agency revoked Ozturk’s visa because she was part of a pro-Palestinian movement that caused “a ruckus” on campus.\n\n“We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses,” he said, while providing no evidence that Ozturk had done anything more disruptive than penning an op-ed. He also suggested he had revoked the visas of “more than 300” students like her on similar grounds.\n\nThis is a clarifying moment for American democracy. Unmarked and unidentified law enforcement abducting a lawful migrant, seemingly in retaliation for First Amendment-protected speech, is the sort of attack on civil liberties that we would not hesitate to label as authoritarian in another country.\n\nAnd it is only one example among many.\n\nLong-held fears about the weaponization of the US government against dissenters are thus no longer hypothetical. What’s happening is the full-spectrum application of federal immigration powers for authoritarian ends. And things are likely to get worse from here.\n\nImmigration enforcement as an authoritarian gateway drug\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mother Jones published a story about how the Trump administration identified Venezuelans for deportation that illustrates just how dangerous the current moment is.\n\nReporters Noah Lanard and Isabela Dias conducted extensive interviews with the friends, families, and community members of several men who had been sent to El Salvador. They found no evidence that these men were, as the Trump administration alleged, members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Rather, the reporters found, they were abducted purely because they have tattoos.\n\nNeri Alvarado Borges, a Venezuelan baker who lived in the Dallas area, is a case in point.\n\nNo one who knew him believed he had any connection to Tren de Aragua. They did, however, note that he had a large tattoo of a ribbon — a tribute to his brother, Nelyerson, a 15-year-old with autism. According to Borges, this tattoo and two others were the sole reasons for his detention.\n\n“Well, you’re here because of your tattoos,” an ICE agent told Borges, per Mother Jones’ reporting. “We’re finding and questioning everyone who has tattoos.”\n\nThis is, as a matter of law enforcement, an absurd policy. Experts on Tren de Aragua do not believe there is a generally reliable way to use tattoos to identify gang members. This is substantiated by other reports of ICE mistakes, such as sending a professional soccer player to a Salvadoran prison because, his lawyer says, of his Real Madrid ink.\n\nBut as an attempt to assert power, it makes sense. The government has identified groups they wish to repress — like Venezuelan migrants and pro-Palestinian activists — and is using the threat of abduction and physical harm to control or silence them. It is classic authoritarian politics: using law enforcement to punish law-abiding individuals who belong to the wrong groups or have the wrong ideas.\n\nIt is easy to see why noncitizens are getting the worst of it right now. They enjoy fewer rights under the American legal system, making it far easier to subject them to the brutest of brute force.\n\nYet, as Trump’s treatment of universities and federal bureaucrats shows, he is eager to wield arbitrary power against citizens as well. And there are good reasons to believe that versions of the tactics being used on immigrants today might one day be directed against citizens — not the least of which is the Trump team’s longstanding fascination with “denaturalization,” the process of stripping citizenship from naturalized Americans.\n\nIn his 2021 book Immigration and Freedom, political theorist Chandran Kukathas argues that immigration enforcement by its very nature entails restrictions on citizens’ rights. The very act of trying to distinguish between citizens and noncitizens, for the purposes of deportation or provision of benefits, requires increased levels of surveillance and monitoring against every person residing in the country. How else are governments to distinguish between those they intend to target and those whom they do not?\n\nKukathas is writing about immigration enforcement systems in general — pointing out that even the best-intentioned ones require some restrictions on freedom. But what happens when you have an attempt to wield the powers created by immigration enforcement in an arbitrary manner, one seemingly designed to repress critics and sow terror?\n\nWell, then you get statements like this one from White House aide Stephen Miller: “Dear marxist judges: If an illegal alien criminal breaks into our country the only ‘process’ he is entitled to is deportation.”\n\nMiller here is not just expressing contempt for the idea of “due process.” He is expressing contempt for the idea that there should be any legal checks on their ability to identify whom to deport. Due process exists because law enforcement can’t be trusted to only go after the “right” targets. Free societies depend on oversight and limitations on police power. Otherwise, freedoms are just words on paper subject to the whims of those who have guns.\n\nIn expressing such unmitigated hostility to this idea, Miller has shown us the disturbing linkage between the administration’s assault on immigrants, its repression of American citizens, and its contempt for legal oversight.\n\nThey are acting like they have the right to go after whomever they want, for whatever reason they went, in whatever manner they want — and that anyone who tries to stop them is disloyal at best and a terrorist sympathizer at worst.\n\nWe’ve seen this kind of politics before. And its track record is grim.",

Being rejected is seen as, at worst, an embarrassing personal failure, and, at best, an obstacle standing in the way of our hearts’ desires: a dream job, a thriving social circle, a first date with a gorgeous future partner. Last year, it dawned on me that I was actively avoiding rejection in my writing career in order to keep myself safe — and small. So I set my sights on denial.\n\nI dreamed up a project called November of NO and gathered an online group of 15 people to join me in my quest. “We’ll build resilience by inviting no’s into our lives, all in the pursuit of getting to yes,” my pitch went. The point was to make rejection itself the goalpost to reduce the fear and stickiness around it, and simultaneously get closer to our objectives. We set goals to eagerly get rejected from job applications, film grants, pitches (my personal goal as a freelance journalist), and other targets of our yearnings. Each week, we logged our attempts, rejections, and finally, any yeses we received.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI aimed to get three pitch rejections a week, or 12 in total. When I shifted my attention to rejection rather than success, it felt so much easier to do the work — my perfectionism-forward world was topsy-turvy, and getting a no was suddenly worth celebrating. By the end of the month, I had racked up seven rejections and landed three new editorial assignments.\n\nSera Bonds, a November of No group member who has long worked in nonprofit development, says she sent out around 80 total asks that month. It was also her first time tracking the number of rejections she received, even though rampant rejection has been a part of her work for 30 years.\n\n“I don’t take it personally when friends can’t hang out, or my teenagers say no,” she says. “A no is actually a yes to something else.”\n\n“I feel like about five years in, I really learned that there’s a critical mass of nos you have to get to get to the number of yeses you need, and it really has nothing to do with me,” Bonds says. “When I ask somebody for money, or I’m looking for a contract or a collaboration, most of the time the reason they say no is something on their end. So now I just trust it, and I don’t take it personally.”\n\nBond says that attitude has seeped into other parts of her life, too. “I don’t take it personally when friends can’t hang out, or my teenagers say no,” she says. “A no is actually a yes to something else.”\n\nLearning to see rejection as opportunity rather than failure can lead to more satisfaction in many aspects of life, from work and personal goals to dating and building strong relationships, experts say. And research has long shown that having high rejection sensitivity can mean developing low self-esteem; avoiding closeness in relationships, especially romantic ones; and is linked to a higher risk of other mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.\n\nPlus, failing, regrouping, and getting back up again builds resilience. As the adage goes, you miss every shot you don’t take — and even missed shots can help you take better aim.\n\nRyan C. Warner, a psychologist and consultant, trains his leadership and business clients to adopt a “rejection mindset,” which means learning to approach rejection rather than avoid it. “It’s teaching individuals to deliberately seek out situations where they may fail and, ultimately, that helps build confidence that they will succeed.”\n\n“That emotional pain that we experience from rejection gives our brains a signal: Hey, something’s wrong.”\n\nOur aversion to rejection is deeply rooted in evolutionary psychology, Warner says. Fitting into social groups helps ensure our survival, so we instinctively learned to avoid any behavior that caused a negative social reaction. Rejection triggers a response in the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes emotions as well as our “fight or flight” instinct.\n\n“That emotional pain that we experience from rejection gives our brains a signal: Hey, something’s wrong,” Warner says. “You need to react, or you need to avoid, so you don’t feel that pain anymore. … When this is constantly reinforced, it will ultimately recreate that fear of future rejection internally, [and lead to] avoidance.”\n\nSome neurodivergent people might experience rejection aversion even more acutely. Some 6 percent of American adults have ADHD, and people with ADHD can experience rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD), or intense emotional pain when faced with rejection.\n\nAnushka Basu, a 29-year-old finance writer based in India, was diagnosed with ADHD after experiencing extreme social anxiety during college, and later RSD, which she says starts subtle but, eventually, “freezes my body and mind.” It was a long process for Basu to learn how to better handle rejection, she says.\n\n“It starts with friends and family pointing out your shortcomings,” she wrote in an email. “Then, we go on to internalize it, and before we know it, it paralyzes us. So, in essence, we reject our own selves before anyone else.”\n\nHow to have a better relationship to rejection\n\nIt is possible for each of us to build more tolerance to rejection, and even to grow our self-confidence and self-acceptance as we do it. The key is to learn to understand “no” as a hallway to the next room rather than a closed door in your face — and that it’s not usually personal.\n\nHelping people with RSD conquer fear of rejection is a key part of the work that therapist Billy Roberts, founder of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio, does with his clients. “Ultimately, if someone tells you no, the default isn’t that they think you’re worthless or that they think you’re a bad person or not good enough,” Roberts says. “You’ve got to learn to manage your emotions so that you can put yourself out there again — and then eventually you win, because you’re putting yourself in situations where winning is a possibility.”\n\n1) Create rejection goals\n\nWarner recommends deciding on an aspect of your life you want to improve or change, then creating tangible goals. He finds the SMART framework helpful — that is, setting goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). This means your goals are actually achievable and trackable over time, and you’ll know whether or not you hit them. For example, if you want to date more, you might set a SMART goal to go on five dates in the next three months, or meet five new people — which necessarily entails putting yourself out there more. Just make sure your goals are realistic.\n\n“I think it’s definitely effective for people, having measurable [goals] that you feel like you’re making progress toward,” Roberts says. “But people set themselves up and they’re like, ‘I’m going to apply for 100 jobs this week,’ and then they have a hard time taking action on that.”\n\nCarla Birnberg, an author who writes a newsletter about building habits for a successful life, first got more comfortable with rejection when she was shopping her book manuscript around 2000. “It definitely desensitized me to rejection,” she says. Now, she has a goal to get rejected as a podcast guest five times a week. “I would love to be on two podcasts a month, but I know five rejections a week is the only way to get there,” Birnberg says. “It brings me closer to that yes.”\n\nShe also uses people’s responses and feedback to refine her message, and hopefully get a higher response and approval rate as she goes along. “Rejections aren’t all the same,” she says.\n\n2) Reflect on your rejection hangups\n\nBoth meditation and journaling are easy and inexpensive ways to get to know yourself better, and have proven mental health benefits. They can also help you interrogate your response to rejection. “Ask yourself, ‘What are some times I may be rejecting myself?’” Warner says. You can also get guided support from a professional with therapy or counseling.\n\nWhen Basu realized she didn’t want to define herself through rejection, she began to analyze rejections in her journal, asking herself why each situation did not work out as she had hoped or expected. Then, she wrote down things she learned, what she could do differently next time, and how this rejection might change her future for good. She began to notice that some rejections weren’t personal, and took note of her own resilience.\n\n“In hindsight, I noticed moments where I thought rejection spelled the end, yet I ended up with something better down the line,” Basu says. “I started telling myself, ‘I am good enough.’ … Over time, I started to view rejection as a part of the process towards finding the right prospects.

I started to view rejections as a need for redirection instead of failure.”\n\n3) Trust that rejection can get easier — and builds confidence\n\nThe catch-22 of rejection is that you have to experience it, recover, and try, try again to “get that positive feedback loop going,” Roberts says. The more rejections you sail through, the easier it will get, and, eventually, the more you’ll discover that risk, and even straight up rejection, does reap rewards.\n\nRoberts wants to remind people that “action comes before healing,” meaning it’s only through repeatedly being rejected, processing your emotions, and moving forward that you will eventually have a reduction in anxiety around rejection.",

        "content": "On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. And while, within a few weeks, that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges, it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the questions: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In the video above, we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.",

She joined Vox in 2022 as a senior producer and then as host of The Weeds, Vox’s policy podcast.\n\nIf you’ve read the news lately, you’ve probably heard that Americans may be in the middle of a sex recession. But at least one demographic of people are having the best sex of their lives: Gen X women. At least that’s the argument writer Mireille Silcoff makes in her most recent piece in the New York Times magazine.\n\nIn it, she explores her own middle-aged sexual awakening. “I was trying to explain a moment that I was really seeing everywhere,” she told Vox. Between her own life, her friends’ experiences, and the portrayals in pop culture that were popping up everywhere, she sensed a trend emerging. “There seems to be something new in the air having to do with 50-year-old women, their bodies, sex, and relationships.”\n\nSo what is in the air right now? And what’s behind these later-in-life sexual revelations? We talked to Silfcoff to find out exactly what’s going on here in this week’s episode of Explain It to Me, Vox’s weekly call-in show. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to Explain It to Me on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you’d like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.\n\nWhat prompted you to write about this in the first place?\n\nI split up from my ex in my late 40s, after a very long relationship of 21 years. When I came out of it, I just thought that what lay ahead of me would be a pretty spinster-ish existence. I was really, really sick for a long time in my adulthood, and my marriage was very long and there were two children. I just felt like, “Well, who is going to want this bag of problems? Now I’m 50.” Life is going to be orange pekoe tea, Masterpiece Theater, taking care of my kids, and hopefully remobilizing my writing, and that’s it. And then instead what happened was I had a lot of wonderful new relationships with a lot of wonderful men and the kind of sex that I don’t think I had even had in my 20s: a total new world of openness, exploration, interest, comfort in myself, self-knowledge and even, I daresay, wisdom. It felt revelatory.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nAnd at first, I felt like this was my weird, cool story. But then, as stuff started coming out of the culture, some of my other friends divorced and had similar situations to mine, I realized that what I had been doing or what I had experienced post-marriage was really part of a much larger cultural story that might ring true for many women in America and beyond today.\n\nWhat do you think the factors are in this mid-life sexual revitalization?\n\nThe women who are middle-aged now are — for the most part — Gen X. You’re starting to get some millennial middle-aged people as well. And Gen X women had a really interesting formative experience when it comes to sex in the ’90s. Divorce is also happening later than ever.\n\nDivorce and sexual exploration for women is a very old story: You get divorced and suddenly find a little piece of yourself sexually. I feel like that’s kind of a big part of the story as well. So women having a bit of this sexual rediscovery later and finding when they’re 47 or 55 that desire is still there, that sexual function is still there, that — thanks to the amazing strides that Gen Z and millennials have made opening up what’s acceptable sexually — acceptance is still there.\n\nRelated The online sex police are always watching and always so mad\n\nSo Gen X women are more comfortable in their bodies. They may be more into figuring out kinks and things like that. Why do you think this is happening with Gen X women in particular? Why is this generation so different from boomers?\n\nBoomers were constricted by a lot of societal norms that were, for lack of a better way of putting it, very mid-century. There was an open attitude toward sex, and free love was a boomer construct. But what happened with all of that stuff is that when all of those ideas really came to roost in the late ’80s and the early ’90s — when women were suddenly working but men were still the bosses — it created a tough situation for the people who inherited that very open sexual culture.\n\nI see Gen X as being a generation of women who really were plunked into an extremely sexualized landscape and were needing to fend for themselves. There wasn’t a lot of support for how to navigate bosses who were sexually predatory. There weren’t a lot of roadmaps for how to have sex or how to be a sexual person. That was both good and bad, because, for instance, many women didn’t experience orgasms because they just couldn’t figure out how and their male partners couldn’t figure out how so it just didn’t happen. I feel like that wouldn’t happen now. You’ve got things like OMG Yes, which is a website where you can find out how to have a female orgasm. It’s a much more open environment now in order to find out about sex. But at the same time among the younger generations, there is a bit of a cliff that’s happened with sexual frequency.\n\nI want to talk about that a little bit. There are so many conversations right now about how young people are having less and less sex. It seems like there’s a backlash to sex positivity. Do you think millennials and Gen Z women take these sexual freedoms for granted?\n\nYou do take it for granted, as you should. The parents create the situation, and the young people take it for granted.\n\nI think that the culture has basically conspired in every way imaginable against intimacy, against having an open and easy sexuality, against relationships. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that you really see the sexual drop-off starting to happen in the same years that the iPhone was introduced. It’s in the same years that social media really got going.\n\n“The culture has basically conspired in every way imaginable against intimacy, against having an open and easy sexuality, against relationships.”\n\nPeople go out less, they hang out less. They do things together less in weird spaces where things can get weird. There was a lot more natural weirdness back in the day. And natural weirdness can lead to intimate moments, which can lead to sex. I just feel like there’s a certain cleanliness of experience in the culture right now where people are so afraid to intermingle in those old ways. It has had a big effect on people’s ability to hook up or have casual sex or go from one boyfriend to another to another until you find one that you like. In some ways, I think it’s wonderful for middle-aged people who already had that socialization.\n\nWhat do you hope for middle-aged women moving forward? Especially when it comes to sex, desire, and relationships?",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent and head writer for Vox’s Future Perfect section and has worked at Vox since 2014. He is particularly interested in global health and pandemic prevention, anti-poverty efforts, economic policy and theory, and conflicts about the right way to do philanthropy.\n\nIf, on January 19, 2025, a day before Donald Trump’s inauguration, you had asked foreign aid experts, “does the US Agency for International Development (USAID) need reform?” most would have readily said “yes.” Not enough programs are evaluated for effectiveness; too much is run through a small number of private contractors; the foreign aid mission is fragmented across too many different departments, only some of which are under USAID’s purview.\n\nThe future of the agency, and foreign aid from the US in general, remains incredibly uncertain. Federal judges have issued injunctions against the administration’s firings, spending freeze, and attempts to dissolve the agency, but the administration is sure to appeal and we are likely months away from a final resolution at the Supreme Court.\n\nSome effects will be lasting even if the Court rules for USAID: Foreign aid groups reliant on its funding are running out of money and time, meaning that life-saving programs are on pause and many groups are on the verge of bankruptcy. But exactly how much of the Trump agenda will remain when the smoke clears is yet to be seen.\n\nPerhaps the best way to understand where the foreign aid world is, as of late March, is through the stages of grief. The initial blitzkrieg against USAID in January had a feel of unreality: the natural reaction was denial. Once it became clear that the agency was under attack and that as a result, millions could die, the natural and correct reaction was anger.\n\nToday, though, the dominant reaction I see in the sector is “bargaining.” No one thinks USAID or foreign aid generally are going back to where they were on January 19. While we don’t know what changes will last, it’s undeniable that some will.\n\nThe imperative that many in the sector are now feeling is not merely to push back on the administration, but to adapt to the new reality in a way that hopefully preserves the best of USAID, while making some of the reforms that experts have been demanding for years.\n\n“We should see this as a challenge, those of us who believe in the promise of aid, to put proposals on the table,” Ken Opalo, a professor of African politics at Georgetown who has studied the effects of aid, says. “I’ve had debates with people who say, ‘Now is not the time to talk about the bad aspects of aid, because these people are not acting in good faith.’ But from a low-income country perspective, I think now is the best time to talk about that. It creates an opportunity for everyone to rethink what’s possible in the aftermath of the Trump era.”\n\nThe fog of aid\n\nThis is normally the section in the article where I’d tell you where US foreign assistance stands today, but the truth is that absolutely nobody knows for sure.\n\nBut the details of what this actually means are much less clear. The leaked list of terminated projects, given to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by a whistleblower, was 5,724 items long; Rubio claimed to only be shuttering 5,200 projects. Which was it? Since then, another list leaked, this one listing 909 projects that were still active. But that list included 373 projects that were on the 5,724 item list, seeming to confirm widespread rumors that Rubio and his team were un-terminating some projects that they had previously killed.\n\nThen on March 25, yet another list leaked to the New York Times, showing 5,341 USAID awards that the administration sought to cancel and 898 that it intends to keep. According to this memo only 869 of the agency’s 6,000-odd employees would stay employed. Programs to help maternal and child health would see a 92 percent cut; over $1 billion would be cut from HIV/AIDS programs, and over $250 million from malaria.\n\nThe cuts detailed include ending support for Gavi, an international group financing vaccinations in poor countries that has saved many millions of lives, as well as ending many anti-malaria programs that have done the same by distributing bednets and medication. “By Gavi’s own estimate,” the Times’ Stephanie Nolen writes, “the loss of US support may mean 75 million children do not receive routine vaccinations in the next five years, with more than 1.2 million children dying as a result.” The State Department confirmed to Nolen, and to me in a statement, that this latest leaked document is authentic. Cuts like the Gavi measure, a State Department spokesperson told me, took place because Rubio “determined the award was inconsistent with the national interest or Agency policy priorities.”\n\nLest you think this puts an end to the uncertainty, there are still the courts. What the Trump administration is doing is, bluntly, illegal. They are refusing to spend money lawfully appropriated by Congress and are trying to shut down an agency whose existence Congress, in a 1998 law, mandated. They have terminated civil servants in violation of federal civil service laws. It should thus not be terribly surprising that multiple judges have issued injunctions against this behavior.\n\nFor aid supporters, the judges are a source of hope. But they also add uncertainty. Are the 5,341 projects that Rubio’s latest spreadsheet states are canceled…really canceled? Could they be switched back on by a final Supreme Court ruling soon? If the Supreme Court rules that USAID cannot be shut down, will Rubio and the Trump administration comply? Or will they defy the court, as Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and several other administration officials have threatened?\n\n“We’re just in such a quandary now, in terms of the state of operations, that it becomes really hard to step back and think about what comes next,” Erin Collinson, director of policy outreach at the Center for Global Development, says.\n\nBut we do know a few things, or at least have good guesses on a few things. By the end of Trump’s term, or the end of his assault on aid, it seems likely that:\n\nThe turn toward programs that are easy to defend from attack might be good for some things, like global health, but it might be harmful to other valuable efforts. W. Gyude Moore, who served as Minister for Public Works in Liberia from 2014 to 2018, argues that the aid we’ll miss most is “the part that helps governments become better in delivering services to their people. That’s the stuff that’s easy to make fun of — ‘$15 million to give Liberians confidence for elections,’ blah, blah, blah.”\n\nSome of that capacity-building funding was more effective than others, Moore concedes, but some of it worked: He points to how the choice of Western donors to condition government debt relief for poor countries on improvement on measures of inflation and economic growth led to many countries investing in ministries of finance that could reliably track those metrics. That’s a real, durable improvement in state capacity that aid can produce. But it’s harder to explain than spending money on life-saving HIV drugs, say.\n\nThat said, considerable uncertainty remains, even within these broad trends. USAID being “smaller” could mean 5-10 percent cuts to funding and staff, or it could mean the agency ceasing to exist in any recognizable form, independently or inside State, at all. The fight over programs like PEPFAR could keep them safe or fail and watch them lapse — Congress’s authorization for PEPFAR specifically has already formally expired. The latest leaked spreadsheet preserves much HIV funding but not funding for vaccines and malaria. But it seems very likely that this broad picture, of a shrinking USAID with global health programs having the strongest defenders, will hold.\n\nFight or reform?\n\nI normally begin interviews with sources with a simple, “How are things” or “How are you these days”; I had to stop when talking to people in the foreign aid world, because literally no one could answer, “I’m doing well!” The world they know is being dismantled, at a cost of millions of lives, and everyone is processing that grief in their own way.\n\nYou can roughly divide the responses in two. One is a determination to keep fighting: beat the administration in the courts, rely on the Congressional support that has saved foreign aid in the past, and return aid to something as close as possible to January 19, 2025.\n\nCharles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, has been an eloquent exponent of this general view. “I can imagine a scenario in which it becomes pretty clear legally that the administration has to make a good-faith effort to spend the money,” Kenny explained to me. “They put forward a rescissions package [a set of cuts] to get around that. But it turns out there’s no version of the rescissions package that is big and can actually get enough votes for it, so it fails in Congress.” Something like that in fact happened in Trump’s first term.\n\nKenny is clear that this scenario is not good per se. USAID is already operating with much fewer staff, and its partners in the field are struggling or shutting down, so getting money out the door would be much harder in this scenario than one without the past couple months’ disruptions.\n\n“Programs can only go so long without funding and knowledge of what’s coming,” Colin Puzo Smith, director of global policy at the aid advocacy group RESULTS, says. “You can’t tell a program, ‘Just kidding, you’re not terminated!’ in six months, when they will have fired all their staff, shut down clinics, turned away patients.”\n\nBut with that said, Kenny’s is still a scenario where USAID survives, if not intact, then mostly intact.\n\nOthers in the sector are taking a different tack. What aid looks like is clearly in flux, and no one thinks the previous setup with USAID was absolutely, 100 percent perfect. So why not adapt to the moment?\n\nIt’s important not to exaggerate the disagreement here. Kenny and others in his camp have called for substantial reforms to USAID for years. And those arguing for seizing the moment for reform have been vocal in opposing cuts so far. This is a fight within a team that broadly shares the same goals. But the difference in emphasis is nonetheless striking.\n\nThe Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network (MFAN), a pro-aid coalition including prominent groups like Catholic Relief Services and Save the Children, released a proposal for how the Trump administration should structure aid within the State Department, provided it goes forward with plans to fold USAID into State.\n\n“Our strong preference would be to retain USAID as an independent agency,” Tod Preston, MFAN’s executive director, told me. “We still maintain, as do many others, that USAID cannot be abolished without the consent of Congress. … But at the same time, given how quickly things are going and how reckless many of these actions have been, MFAN thought it was important to put out some guidelines for how, if it is going to be restructured, to do it in as thoughtful and as strategic as a way as possible, to preserve as much of its development and humanitarian capabilities as possible, and in a way that will improve coordination.”\n\nUnlock Aid, another coalition that’s pushed for USAID to invest more in evidence-backed programs and diversify the contractors it uses, is treating the moment similarly, proposing what it calls a “third path.”\n\n“While the termination of programs has raised significant concerns about continuity in critical health and humanitarian efforts,” its leaders, Amanda Arch and Walter Kerr, wrote in a letter to Rubio, “this moment also presents an opportunity to address longstanding systemic challenges in how America engages with the world.” They call on Rubio to “stop programs without clear transitions,” “stop low-impact projects,” “stop funding middlemen,” and instead “prioritize results over process.” The immediately apparent goal is to try to cast a reform agenda in a light congenial to Rubio, and the administration’s overall worldview on aid.\n\nThe rhetoric also gels nicely with a memo leaked from within the State Department, appearing to outline some Trump-appointed officials’ visions for how aid should be restructured. The exact provenance and significance of the memo are unclear. It could be an omen of things to come, or simply one set of ideas that was discussed and rejected. Whatever it is, the leaked memo called for reforming payments so that contractors are only paid if their work generates results, and moving away from the large contractors who have dominated the sector.\n\n“Candidly, there’s a lot in there that looks a lot like some of the things that we have proposed,” Kerr notes.\n\nHere again, though, the tremendous uncertainty around the future of aid creates a problem. One smart, technical change recommended in the leaked memo is to allow USAID to defer to trusted international organizations when it comes to due diligence (that is, ensuring that organizations on the ground receiving funds are reputable). But at the same time, USAID is now pulling out of Gavi, one of the most important of those trusted organizations. It’s one step forward, five steps back.\n\nLiving in the fog\n\nBasically everyone affected by foreign aid is facing unprecedented challenges right now, and no one more so than the people and countries who have relied upon that assistance. Whatever changes or reforms stick, the prescription for them is clear, says Opalo, the political scientist: they need to figure out how to live without aid.\n\nThis is easier for some countries than others. In many of sub-Saharan Africa’s most populous countries, foreign aid is fairly small relative to the economy: 2-4 percent of national income in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. But other places, especially areas that are currently or were recently undergoing civil war, are extremely reliant. In South Sudan, foreign aid makes up nearly half of national income; it is over a third of national income in Syria and Yemen. Some of the most damaged countries in the world could be worst hit by the retreat of aid.\n\nIn countries where aid is small relative to the economy, it will still be hard to abandon the systems that foreign aid has helped build. “Even countries that are fiscally strong, like Kenya, are still critically dependent on donors and consultants for huge swathes of their health planning, disease monitoring, immunization, and other systems,” said Opalo. “Even if the money is available, they’ll still struggle to onboard these systems onto government-run systems.”\n\nBut the tremendous uncertainty left by the US’s chaotic retreat from aid gives recipient countries little choice but to try to strengthen their own state capacity. “I’ve lived in a weak state,” Moore, the former Liberian cabinet minister, says. “All this stuff about shrinking the state — it’s all theoretical. If you live in a state that week, it frightens you when people say ‘the state is too strong.’”",

        "content": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah has become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.\n\nRepublican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation late Thursday that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.\n\nWATCH: What the Research Actually Says About Fluoride in Drinking Water\n\nFluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nREAD MORE: States move to ban or restrict use of synthetic dyes used in candies and cereal\n\nUtah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Cox, who grew up and raised his own children in a community without fluoridated water, compared it recently to being “medicated” by the government.\n\nThe ban comes weeks after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.\n\nMore than 200 million people in the U.S., or almost two-thirds of the population, receive fluoridated water through community water. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\n\nBut some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to the intellectual development of children.\n\nThe president of the American Dental Association, Brett Kessler, has said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water are below levels considered problematic.\n\nOpponents warn the ban will disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.\n\nThe sponsor of the Utah legislation, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of “individual choice” to not have it in the water.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Synthetic dyes used to make brightly colored cereals, drinks and candies are coming under scrutiny in states across the country, where lawmakers say the federal government has stalled in taking action despite evidence of harmful effects.\n\nWest Virginia, which ranks at the bottom in the U.S. for many health metrics, became the first to sign a sweeping statewide ban on seven such dyes this week. Lawmakers in more than 20 states — from deep red West Virginia to heavily Democratic California — are making a bipartisan push to restrict access to the dyes, which have been tied to neurobehavioral problems in some children and of which U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been an outspoken critic.\n\n“We should not be forced to police our own foods,” said Republican Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, who heads the Senate’s health committee and told lawmakers the vote might be the most important of their political careers. “No more toxic colors, no more poisoning ourselves and our children. No more unnecessary risks. Our health is not for sale.”\n\nIn signing the bill, Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey referenced Kennedy’s slogan in saying, “There’s no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission.”\n\nThe prohibition on certain preservatives and red, blue, green and yellow dyes takes effect for school food in August, and across the state in 2028. It follows narrower bills approved in California last year and Virginia last week that would ban six artificial dyes from being served in public schools beginning in 2027.\n\nWhy do lawmakers want to see the dyes die?\n\nThirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S. Nine petroleum-based chemical dyes, including Red 3, have been allowed in U.S. food.\n\nPublic health advocates have been lobbying for state and federal action for years, pointing to research that links food dyes and other chemical additives to health risks, including exacerbating symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in some children and animal research linking certain additives to cancers.\n\nThe European Union and some countries, including Australia and Japan, have banned or restricted the use of certain food dyes because of potential health risks.\n\nIn October, dozens of protesters outside the Michigan headquarters of WK Kellogg Co. demanded that the company remove artificial dyes from cereals such as Apple Jacks and Froot Loops. Kellogg announced that it would remove artificial colors and ingredients from its U.S. products by 2018, but never did so, despite making the change in other countries, such as Canada, where Froot Loops are colored with concentrated carrot juice, watermelon juice and blueberry juice.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned Red 3 from the nation’s food supply in January, setting a 2027 deadline for manufacturers to eliminate it from their products. Makers of ingested drugs like cough syrups have until January 2028.\n\nFood industry warns of cost increases\n\nThe National Confectioners Association, a trade group for chocolate, candy, gum and mints sellers, said the new regulations will make food more expensive, less accessible and lead to less variety on grocery store shelves. It said states such as West Virginia, where 1 in 4 children live in poverty and many neighborhoods are “food deserts” with limited access to affordable, nutritious food, will be disproportionately impacted.\n\nCharles Leftwich, vice president of food safety and quality assurance for Sysco Corp., the world’s largest food service distributor, said food safety policies should be supported by science and “be consistently applied across all geographies.”\n\n“We shouldn’t have a fragmented approach when it comes to food safety, because it breeds a lack of trust and confidence with within consumers,” Leftwich said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nChanges underway\n\nSchool districts in West Virginia have begun phasing out breakfast cereals, strawberry milk or other products in anticipation of the new law’s August deadline.\n\nChris Derico, who runs Harrison County’s school nutrition program, expects the new regulation to increase costs but said he’s not “in panic mode about it” because none of the products containing the artificial dyes are used in main dishes served to students.\n\nTravis Austin, who leads food service in the Cabell County Schools system, called the policy “a step in the right direction” and said it will be up to manufacturers to rework their formulas to remain competitive.\n\n“It’s all about money,” he said. “If Froot Loops and Lucky Charms aren’t going to change their formulations, then we’re not going to buy them. We’ll buy ones that do.”\n\nLawmakers in West Virginia, which leads the nation in chronic diseases such as obesity, noted that the dyes are often found in sugary foods.\n\nWhen the bill passed the state Senate, sponsor Jason Barrett said West Virginia was the first state to approve such a sweeping law but won’t be the last. He cited a bill advancing in Oklahoma that would ban 21 synthetic food dyes and additives.\n\nHe said companies prey on low-income consumers and children.\n\n“With passage of this bill, we are saying to big food corporations that the health of our people comes first,” he said.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Another wipeout is slamming Wall Street Friday as worries build about a potentially toxic mix of worsening inflation and a U.S. economy slowing because of households afraid to spend due to the global trade war.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down 2 percent in afternoon trading and on track for one of its worst days of the last two years. It’s also heading for its fifth losing week in the last six after wiping out what its big gain from the start of the week.\n\nWATCH: How automakers are navigating Trump’s tariffs on imported vehicles and parts\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 732 points, or 1.7 percent, as of 1:45 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 2.7 percent lower.\n\nLululemon Athletica dropped 15 percent to lead the market lower, even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year, in part because “consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,” said CEO Calvin McDonald.\n\nOxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 4.4 percent. CEO Tom Chubb said it saw a “deterioration in consumer sentiment that also weighed on demand” beginning in January, which accelerated into February.\n\nThey’re discouraging data points when one of the main worries hitting Wall Street is that President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.\n\nA report on Friday morning showed all types of U.S. consumers are getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three in a survey by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That’s the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that’s been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.\n\nAnother report released in the morning raised concerns after it showed a widely followed, underlying measure of inflation was a touch worse last month than economists expected. The data followed reports on other measures of inflation for the month, but this is the one the Federal Reserve tracks most closely as it decides what to do with interest rates.\n\nThe report also showed that an underlying measure of how much income Americans are making, which excludes government social benefits and some other items, “has been treading water for the last three months,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.\n\n“Households aren’t in a good place to absorb a little tariff pain,” Jacobsen said. “The Fed isn’t likely to run to the rescue either as inflation moved up more than expected in February.”\n\nREAD MORE: Tariffs on lumber, appliances set stage for higher costs on new homes and remodeling projects\n\nThe Fed has been keeping its main interest rate on hold this year after cutting it sharply in late 2024, in part because of worries about inflation remaining above its 2 percent target. While more cuts to rates would give the economy and financial markets a boost, they would also push upward on inflation.\n\nThe economy and job market have so far been holding up relatively well, but if they were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called “stagflation.” Policy makers in Washington have few good tools to fix it.\n\nSome of Wall Street’s sharpest losses on Friday hit companies that need customers feeling confident enough to spend, and not just on yoga wear or beach clothes. Delta Air Lines lost 5.2 percent. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean Group fell 4.9 percent. Casino operator Caesars Entertainment dropped 4.3 percent.\n\nThe heaviest weights on the market were Microsoft and other Big Tech stocks, whose massive sizes give their movements more sway over indexes. They and other stocks that had gotten caught up in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology have been leading the way lower in Wall Street’s recent sell-off.\n\nTheir prices had shot up so much more quickly than their already fast-growing revenues and profits that critics said they looked too expensive. CoreWeave, whose cloud platform helps customers manage complex AI infrastructure, fell 3 percent in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq. It’s potentially another signal of waning excitement about AI.\n\nOn the flip side, among the relatively few rising stocks on Wall Street were those that can make money almost regardless of what the economy does, such as utilities. American Water Works rose 2.4 percent, for example.\n\nStock markets worldwide will likely remain shaky as an April 2 deadline approaches for more tariffs. That’s what Trump has called “Liberation Day,” when he will roll out tariffs tailored to the United States’ trading partners. In each case, he said the “reciprocal” tariff will match the burden the other country places on the United States, including things like value-added taxes.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell sharply in Japan and South Korea as auto makers felt more pressure following Trump’s announcement he plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on auto imports. Hyundai Motor fell 2.6 percent in Seoul, while Honda Motor fell 2.6 percent, and Toyota Motor sank 2.8 percent in Tokyo.\n\nOn Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.8 percent, and General Motors sank 1.9 percent. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.\n\nThailand’s SET lost 1 percent after a powerful earthquake centered in Myanmar rattled the region, causing the prime minister to declare a state of emergency for the capital, Bangkok.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled to 4.25 percent from 4.38 percent late Thursday. It tends to fall when expectations for either U.S. economic growth or inflation are on the wane.\n\nAP Writers Jiang Junzhe and Matt Ott contributed.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "SCHOENEICHE, Germany (AP) — The U.S. government is on a global egg hunt, seeking exports from countries in Europe and elsewhere to ease a severe shortage that has caused egg prices at grocery stores to hit record highs.\n\nGermany, Italy, Poland and Sweden are among the nations the U.S. Department of Agriculture approached to address the shortage brought on by a bird flu outbreak, according to European industry groups.\n\nWATCH: A look at the real reasons behind soaring egg prices\n\nBut supplying Americans with eggs would be complicated for foreign producers — and not because of political tensions over the myriad import tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened to impose on his nation’s top trading partners.\n\nEven if they were eager to share, European countries don’t have many surplus eggs because of their own avian flu outbreaks and the growing domestic demand ahead of Easter.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles, however, is the approach the United States takes to preventing salmonella contamination. U.S. food safety regulations require fresh eggs to be sanitized and refrigerated before they reach shoppers; in the European Union, safety standards call for Grade A eggs to be sold unwashed and without extended chilling.\n\n“These are two systems that could not be more different,” said Hans-Peter Goldnick, the president of the German Egg Association.\n\nFeathers on eggs at the supermarket\n\nIt is common in parts of Europe, for example, for consumers to buy eggs that still have feathers and chicken poop stuck to them.\n\nFarmer David Karlsch described the simple process that gets eggs from hens to customers of the family-owned Saballus poultry farm in Schoeneiche, a town just outside Germany’s capital: The eggs are taken from nests, placed into cartons and sold on the premises or from a refrigerated vending machine just outside the property.\n\n“The demand at Easter time is of course very, very high, as many children naturally want to paint eggs,” Karlsch said.\n\nPoland, a major egg exporter, fielded a U.S. query about the availability of eggs, according to Katarzyna Gawrońska, director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers. The issue of washed vs. unwashed was a crucial factor as European officials considered such requests, she said.\n\nEggs are not cleaned in most of the 27 EU nations because of concerns that removing the natural protective coating from eggshells makes them more vulnerable to bacteria, Gawrońska said.\n\nPolish veterinary officials are trying to determine if the country and its farmers can meet U.S. requirements, such as whether the exporting nation has a comparable food safety inspection system or a significant bird flu outbreak.\n\nPowdered egg products\n\nAlthough European Union regulations state that table eggs “shall not be washed or cleaned,” member countries have some leeway if they authorized egg baths at packing plants decades ago.\n\nDanish Egg Association CEO Jørgen Nyberg Larsen said national customs are part of it; washed eggs are the norm in Sweden, for example. But Sweden and Norway have informed the U.S. they don’t have extra eggs to export, Larsen said.\n\nFor now, any increased U.S. egg imports from Europe are more likely to arrive in powdered form or other products that can be shipped frozen or dried, Larsen said.\n\nThat’s the response Poland’s trade association gave U.S. officials. If the U.S. certifies Poland as a source, the organization’s members would have a limited number of shell eggs to sell but could supply “very large volumes of egg processing products,” Gawrońska said.\n\nProcessed eggs usually are pasteurized to prevent foodborne illnesses and then used in food manufacturing or by restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nBaked goods, pasta and sauces like mayonnaise are some of the commercial products made with egg powder.\n\nEurope’s own production problems\n\nU.S. officials also tried to sound out farmers in northern Italy’s Veneto region for emergency egg supplies, according to Coldiretti, the main Italian agricultural lobbying organization.\n\nBut Italy only produces enough eggs to cover the national demand so most of the region’s producers said they could not help. Bird flu outbreaks since the start of last year also have taken a toll on the Italian poultry industry.\n\nGermany cannot contribute much either. Its domestic poultry industry generates about 73% of the eggs consumed in the country, “and we ourselves essentially have to import eggs from Holland every day to keep everyone satisfied,” the German Egg Association’s Goldnick said.\n\n“We have around 45 million eggs that we can collect from the chicken coops every day, and in America, there’s a shortage of around 50 million eggs a day. That shows how difficult it is,” he said.\n\nAn improving US market and Easter demand\n\nOther countries the U.S. government contacted include Austria, Norway, Spain and Denmark. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it secured new egg commitments from South Korea and Turkey in recent months, although it did not specify the amount or type.\n\nBrazil, which traditionally exports less than 1% of its total egg production, increased its February shipments to the U.S. by 93% compared to a year earlier, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein.\n\nThe detection of Newcastle disease, a viral condition often fatal to chickens, in some parts of Brazil impedes the South American nation’s ability to become a significant U.S. egg supplier, market insiders say.\n\nImports of liquid, frozen and dried eggs may help free up some domestic shell eggs for consumers, but the U.S. made its appeal for foreign eggs amid a significant deficit; last month, the country produced 720 million fewer table eggs than in February 2024, a decline of nearly 10%.\n\nThe U.S. also cut its own egg exports to boost supplies at home, the Agriculture Department said.\n\nWhile the informal trade talks continue, the U.S. market has shown signs of improvement. It’s been nearly a month since a major bird flu outbreak impacted egg-laying hens, the department said. It reported the national wholesale price for large eggs dropped to $3.27 per dozen as of March 21, or less than half its peak of $8.15 per dozen on Feb. 21.\n\nU.S. consumers are just starting to see those falling wholesale prices translate to lower prices on grocery shelves, the department said. The big demand for eggs that usually accompanies Easter and Passover could cause prices to edge up again next month.\n\nBusiness is business\n\nTrump hasn’t exactly walked on eggshells with the people of Europe since starting his second term. The president’s repeated threats to seize Greenland, a Danish territory, infuriated many in Denmark. His posture toward Ukraine and disparaging remarks from top members of his administration have alarmed America’s European allies.\n\nThe European Union, which is the third-largest trade partner of the U.S., was not exempted from the tariffs Trump ordered on steel, aluminum and automobiles. Bracing for more, it has prepared counter-tariffs on American products.\n\nBut many officials in Europe say none of that would rule out exporting eggs.\n\nGoldnick said an egg producer friend recently told him that “if the price is right, then I’ll deliver.” Any deals made or not would come down to business decisions, he said.\n\n“I have two souls in my chest. On the one hand, I would say, ‘No, we can’t support this system,’ but that’s not the right answer,” he said, referring to new U.S. tariffs on European goods.\n\n“The right answer is we have to help where we can, Goldnick continued. “It doesn’t concern the government. You wouldn’t prop them up or anything, but it’s just people’s demand at Easter, for eggs, and that’s just as important to satisfy in America as it is here.”\n\n___\n\nGera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

I also think it is a convenient thing for the UAW to be able to throw their support behind a Trump action, because they have sort of been in the doghouse with the administration after they publicly supported Kamala Harris in the campaign.\n\nBut it is true that a lot of the assembly workers and UAW members may see more work and we may see new factories as these tariffs are rolled out. But I think the impact across the auto value chain will be uneven. I have just been on the phone with a bunch of parts suppliers, people who don't work in the assembly factories, but in the factories that make the parts that go into the car.\n\nThey are the brunt, most of the automotive industry employees in this country. And a lot of them are very concerned about the impacts of these tariffs. They have already been hit by steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump recently imposed. And they are wondering that. And a lot of them have global value chains as well. So they're wondering if they're going to be able to continue operations as this trade war unfolds.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "NUUK, Greenland (AP) — Vice President JD Vance, his wife and other senior U.S. officials are due to visit an American military base in Greenland on Friday in a trip that was scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were irked that the original itinerary was planned without consulting them.\n\nThe revised trip to the semi-autonomous Danish territory comes as relations between the U.S. and the Nordic country have soured after U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly suggested that the United States should in some form control the mineral-rich territory of Denmark — a traditional U.S. ally and NATO member.\n\nWATCH NOW: Why Trump wants Greenland and what makes it a strategic polar outpost\n\nFriday’s one-day visit to the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, removed the risk of potentially violating diplomatic custom by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. It will also reduce the likelihood that Vance and his wife will cross paths with residents angered by Trump’s announcements.\n\nDuring his visit, Vance was expected to receive briefings and deliver remarks to U.S. service members on the base, according to the vice president’s office. His delegation includes the national security advisor, Mike Waltz, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, as well as second lady Usha Vance.\n\nAccording to a senior White House official, Vance is expected to make the case that Danish leaders have “spent decades mistreating the Greenlandic people, treating them like second-class citizens and allowing infrastructure on the island to fall into disrepair.”\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity to preview the vice president’s message, added that Vance would emphasize the importance of bolstering Arctic security in places like Pituffik.\n\nAhead of Vance’s arrival, four of the five parties elected to Greenland’s parliament earlier this month signed an agreement to form a new, broad-based coalition government. The parties banded together in the face of Trump’s designs on the territory.\n\n“It is a time when we as a population are under pressure,” the prime minister-designate, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said before the accord was signed to applause and cheers in the capital, Nuuk.\n\nHe added that “we must stick together. Together we are strongest,” Greenland broadcaster KNR reported.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen congratulated Nielsen and his incoming government, and said that “I look forward to close cooperation in an unnecessarily conflict-filled time.”\n\nFrederiksen said on Tuesday that the U.S. visit, which was originally set for three days, created “unacceptable pressure.” She has said that Denmark wants to work with the U.S. on defense and security, but Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\n\nInitially, Usha Vance had announced a solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut. Her husband then subsequently said he would join her on that trip, only to change that itinerary again — after protests from Greenland and Denmark — to a one-day visit of the couple to the military post only.\n\nNonetheless, in an interview on Wednesday, Trump repeated his desire for U.S. control of Greenland. Asked if the people there were “eager” to become U.S. citizens, Trump said he didn’t know “but I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.”\n\nInhabitants of Nuuk, which is about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) south of Pituffik, voiced concern about Vance’s visit and the U.S. interest in their island.\n\nCora Høy, 22, said Vance was “welcome if he wants to see it but of course Greenland is not for sale.” She added that “it’s not normal around here” with all the attention Greenland is getting. “I feel now every day is about (Trump) and I just want to get away from it.”\n\n“It’s all a bit crazy. Of course the population here is a bit shook up,” said 30-year-old Inuk Kristensen. “My opinion is the same as everyone’s: Of course you don’t do things this way. You don’t just come here and say that you want to buy the place.”\n\nAs the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world’s largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn’t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump’s plans.\n\nVance has several times criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S.\n\n___\n\nGrieshaber reported from Berlin.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court for permission to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law, while a court fight continues.\n\nThe emergency appeal to the high court follows a rejection of the Republican administration’s plea to the federal appeals court in Washington. By a 2-1 vote, a panel of appellate judges left in place an order temporarily prohibiting deportations of the migrants under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act.\n\nWATCH: Federal judge questions Trump’s authority to deport migrants without due process\n\nThe Justice Department argued in court papers that federal courts shouldn’t interfere with sensitive diplomatic negotiations. It also claimed that migrants should make their case in a federal court in Texas, where they are being detained.\n\nThe order temporarily blocking the deportations was issued by U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, the chief judge at the federal courthouse in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II to justify the deportation of hundreds of people under a presidential proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.\n\n“Here, the district court’s orders have rebuffed the President’s judgments as to how to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in the court filing.\n\nAttorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of five Venezuelan noncitizens who were being held in Texas, hours after the proclamation was made public.\n\nThe court set a Tuesday deadline for a response from the ACLU.\n\nThe case has become a flashpoint amid escalating tension between the White House and the federal courts.\n\nBoasberg imposed a temporary halt on deportations and ordered planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to return to the U.S. That did not happen. The judge has since vowed to determine whether the government defied his order to turn the planes around. The administration has invoked a “state secrets privilege” and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.\n\nTrump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg. In a rare statement, Chief Justice John Roberts said “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity for a hearing before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nBoasberg ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. His ruling said there is “a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.”",

Most agencies didn't reply. Some did.\n\nWe did — in fact, the CIA did, in fact, ask us not to publish one of the texts, and we agreed not to do it because we obviously would want to be responsible. But, I mean, it's interesting that the CIA director says there's nothing sensitive or classified in this, but his own agency asked us not to publish one of these texts.\n\nAnd, this morning, we decided to publish these texts so people can see for themselves what was going on in the Signal chat that I saw, obviously inadvertently, because I was included in this secret Signal chain. And these are texts, and especially the Pete Hegseth text that you referred — that was referred to earlier, saw that two hours before the beginning of a strike.\n\nObviously, when I was seeing that, one of the thoughts that was crossing my mind was, what if it wasn't me who was mistakenly included on this chain, but what if it was somebody who was friendly to the Houthis or to their Iranian sponsors or to Russia or China?\n\nAnd I think the point is well-taken.

Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

They just branded it or framed it as something different.\n\nAnd that's where this really becomes key is, is that is the lens through which people see the world. And so when all of that programming is sort of tilting the scales in favor of the right, the story that the majority of Americans are getting day-to-day is right leaning.\n\nAnd I see no better illustration of that gap than if you look at in particular what's happening with young people. Young people are accelerating and moving to the right faster than any other demographic. And I don't think it's a coincidence that they just happen to consume online media more than any other demographic does.\n\nThat's their primary source and yet they themselves are moving at a faster and faster clip to the right because that landscape is so heavily dominated and saturated by the right.",

        "content": "ST. LOUIS – St. Louis University was set to apologize for enslaving people. Hours before the ceremony, a group of descendants of Black people the school enslaved backed out, citing concerns that the yearslong reconciliation process ultimately felt too symbolic.\n\n“We had no choice but to not participate in this today,” said Robin Proudie, executive director and founder of Descendants of the St. Louis University Enslaved, at a briefing Wednesday.\n\nProudie’s voice broke while delivering her remarks to reporters.\n\n“For five years we have done everything they have asked us to do,” she said, “but what we will not do is become a photo opp so they can parade us around and act like we are in alignment with what they are doing.”\n\nREAD MORE: In St. Louis, a chance to preserve Black history\n\nProudie is descended from Henrietta Mills, who was enslaved by the Jesuits in St. Louis some 165 years ago. She was hopeful after years of collaborating with the university on what repair and reconciliation would look like. She told PBS News that the descendants pulled out after learning that the board approved an approach to move forward that completely took reparations off of the table. The school, Proudie said, planned to commit to an apology, a monument, and a report.\n\n“If this is about mutual respect, then we want to be treated as such,” she added.\n\nSt. Louis University spokesperson Clayton Berry confirmed to PBS News that a prayer service scheduled for the formal apology was postponed after the descendants group said they were not participating in the event.\n\nA statement from university President Fred P. Pastello was taped to the door of the St. Francis Xavier College Church on campus where the event was supposed to take place, saying the event was postponed. However, the university did not comment further on the postponed apology or whether reparations were still part of the conversation.\n\n“In a number of forthright and challenging conversations this week, it became clear that we need to continue the work of building relationships with descendants before we are ready to proceed with a formal event,” the statement read in part.\n\nThe university is one of several nationwide institutions that have been pushed by various advocacy groups and community leaders to engage in reconciliation efforts after their ties to slavery came to light. St. Louis University’s history with slavery gained more attention in 2016 after The New York Times spotlighted Georgetown University’s 1838 sale of 272 enslaved people to keep the school afloat. Those who were brought to St. Louis are the descendants of those enslaved in Georgetown.\n\nThe Society of Jesuits relied on enslaved labor around the world since its founding in 1540. That included in the United States until 1865, when slavery was abolished. During that time, the faith-based group used enslaved Black people to support their churches and schools in states like Missouri, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, Illinois and Kansas. Saint Louis University, along with Georgetown University and Spring Hill College, relied directly upon enslaved labor.\n\nProudie has for years turned to family documents to weave together her family’s history.\n\nWATCH MORE: Green Book exhibit showcases history, struggles and triumphs of Black travel in the U.S.\n\nKelly Schmidt, a postdoctoral research associate at Washington University, found in 2021 that the number of people the Jesuits enslaved in St. Louis over time was at least 70 people.\n\nThe push for the university to acknowledge this history also saw support from students across campus.\n\nThe school’s student government passed a resolution in 2024 asking the university to outline an action plan. In a letter to DSLUE, St. Louis County NAACP president Adolphus M. Pruitt II threw support behind the growing call for the university and the Society of Jesuits to “further acknowledge the harm that was inflicted upon these individuals and their descendants as a foundation for reconciliation and healing.”\n\nOn the steps of the church where the apology was set to take place Areva Martin, lead counsel for DSLUE, called on St. Louis University to act.\n\n“This is your opportunity to step up,” she said.",

        "content": "BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israel on Friday launched an attack on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for the first time since a ceasefire ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in November.\n\nAssociated Press reporters in Beirut heard a loud boom and witnessed smoke rising from the area in Beirut’s southern suburbs that Israel’s military had vowed to strike.\n\nThe attack was the first strike on Beirut since a ceasefire took hold on Nov. 27, 2024 between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group, although Israel has struck targets in southern Lebanon almost daily since then.\n\nAfter the strike, Israel’s army said it attacked a Hezbollah drone storage facility in the area of Dahiyeh, which it called a key Hezbollah stronghold. Israel said Hezbollah uses civilians as human shields and said it issued advanced warning for people to leave.\n\nThe area struck is a residential and commercial area and is in close proximity to at least two schools.\n\nThe strike came after Israel’s army urgently warned people to evacuate parts of a Beirut suburb, vowing to retaliate against strikes which it said were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel.\n\nIsrael’s defense minister said Friday that if there was no peace in Israel’s northern communities there would be no peace in Beirut either.\n\nHezbollah denied firing the rockets at northern Israel, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon.\n\nLebanon’s government ordered all schools and universities in Beirut’s southern suburb of Hadath to close for the day. Residents were seen fleeing the area in cars and on foot ahead of the strike.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group’s senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.\n\nIsraeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.\n\nLast week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people.\n\nSpeaking from Paris, Lebanon’s President, Joseph Aoun, said the strike on a Beirut suburb was a continuation “of Israel’s violations of the agreement” that was sponsored by France and the U.S.\n\nThe UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the exchange of fire was deeply concerning. “This is a critical period for Lebanon and the wider region,” she said Friday.\n\nIsraeli strikes in other parts of Lebanon on Friday killed three people and wounded 18, including children and women, in the southern village of Kfar Tibnit, said Lebanon’s health ministry.\n\nThe escalation comes as Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people in Gaza. Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile.\n\nHamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThe war was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251.\n\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants.\n\n——————\n\nAssociated Press reporter Julia Frankel in Jerusalem contributed to this report.",

As judge Henderson and the D.C. Circuit pointed out, migration is not an invasion. This is a very dangerous path we're going on if the government can say we're unilaterally going to designate any gang we want during peacetime as an enemy alien and then ship people off, especially if there's no due process.\n\nI would just add that Congress was so specific that no other administration in the history of this country has been confused about what powers it vests the president with. It's only been used three times in the history of the country, all during declared wars, the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\n\nNo president has tried to take this lawless action of saying we're going to designate a criminal gang as a foreign country invading the United States.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "As congressional Republicans seek about $4.5 trillion to extend expiring tax cuts, the federal government will need to find savings elsewhere. Experts say budget cuts could affect Medicaid coverage for as many as millions of Americans, at a time when the program may need more funding, not less.\n\nThe proposed House bill requires the Committee on Energy and Commerce to find $880 billion in spending cuts, which means some aspects of Medicaid, which the committee oversees, may be on the chopping block.\n\nMedicaid is a massive government program that provides free and reduced-cost health care for eligible enrollees. It offers critical coverage to a wide variety of Americans, including children, adults with disabilities and older people in nursing homes.\n\nEven for Americans who have private insurance, Medicaid can play a part in their health care. That’s because Medicaid is such a large engine of funding for so many aspects of the country’s health coverage.\n\nThe public health insurance option is funded in part by the federal government and in part by states, covering around 72 million people as of October. A total of 84 million people across the U.S. and its territories were covered either partially or in full as of June, the most recent month for which the government has data.\n\nThe federal government spent about $880 billion on Medicaid in fiscal year 2023, the most recent year for which there’s data, according to an analysis by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF.\n\nMedicaid is an extremely popular entitlement program, said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF.\n\nMore than 9 in 10 adults say Medicaid is “very” or “somewhat” important to their local community, according to recent KFF polling. Forty percent of respondents said they wanted Medicaid funding to remain the same, while 42 percent wanted to increase funding for the program. Just 17 percent wanted to decrease funding “a little” or “a lot.”\n\nREAD MORE: Supreme Court to consider if states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood\n\nSome studies have found that expanding Medicaid can save money for states, including in spending reductions in corrections health care as well as mental health and substance abuse care.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said his administration will not cut Medicaid benefits, and will instead reduce spending by eliminating waste and fraud.\n\nAccording to health policy experts, there may not be a way to fund the tax cuts without cutting Medicaid. Doing that will have real implications, said Allison Orris, senior fellow and director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n“It’s fair to say [that] if Medicaid is cut by hundreds of billions of dollars, people will lose coverage. But some of the ways in which they will lose coverage and health care and access are a little bit tricky,” she said.\n\nWho and what relies on Medicaid?\n\nMedicaid covers low-income Americans in all 50 states, as well as D.C. and the American territories, but the program’s benefits are farther reaching.\n\nMedicaid pays for around 2 in every 5 births in the country. The program accounts for about 20 percent of both hospital funding and total health care spending nationwide, according to KFF. That organization’s analyses of hundreds of studies conducted since 2014 largely found that Medicaid expansion helped cut hospital costs associated with uninsured patients. Many studies also found that Medicaid expansion helped with overall hospital funding and resulted in fewer hospital closures, though KFF notes that may vary.\n\nAnd Medicaid – not Medicare – is the single largest payer of long-term care coverage, including nursing home care.\n\nHere are some of the ways Medicaid is crucial for so many Americans’ health care.\n\nLong-term care for people with disabilities\n\nAccording to KFF analyses, 35 percent of people with disabilities have Medicaid, around 15 million people. That compares with 19 percent of people without disabilities, the majority of whom have employer-provided health insurance.\n\nCurrently, Medicaid covers about 60 percent of long-term care coverage, much of which provides care for younger adults with disabilities.\n\nNursing homes\n\nMedicaid is the primary payer of nursing care in the U.S.; it covers 63 percent of nursing home residents, according to KFF.\n\nFor many older adults, “Medicaid is the safety net,” says David Grabowski, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. “An individual can be middle-income their entire life and then reach their older, long-term care years and have to enter a nursing home.”\n\nBecause nursing homes can be so expensive, families can quickly deplete their assets, then rely on Medicaid to cover long-term care.\n\nChildren\n\nThirty-seven percent of people enrolled in Medicaid are children, but they account for only about 15 percent of the program’s spending.\n\nIn 2023, KFF found that of the 72 million people enrolled in Medicaid, about 30 million were children. Millions more children are enrolled in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which some states run with Medicaid expansion funds. So far, political conversation has not focused on cutting CHIP funding.\n\nREAD MORE: Texas schools and families struggle as hundreds of thousands of kids lose Medicaid coverage\n\nRural maternal health\n\nMedicaid covered around 40 percent of births nationwide in 2023, KFF found, and nearly half of all rural births.\n\nREAD MORE: Hourslong drives and huge bills. Here’s what the pregnant and uninsured face in South Dakota\n\nStudies also show that being enrolled in Medicaid leads to improved health outcomes for children, including declines in infant and child mortality, preventive care visits on par with privately insured children and even potentially positive outcomes into adulthood, such as improvements in education.\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaskan Natives\n\nFour in 10 American Indian/Alaskan Native people are enrolled in Medicaid – the highest enrollment rate among any race and ethnicity category. This includes about 23 percent of nonelderly AIAN adults and 44 percent of AIAN children.\n\nHow the federal government funds states’ Medicaid plans\n\nMedicaid began as an optional program in 1966 alongside Medicare, with around 8 million people eligible for enrollment. By the 1980s, all states had opted into providing health insurance through Medicaid.\n\nThough eligibility requirements have changed over the last 60 years and vary by state, the most significant change to Medicaid was the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010. It required states to cover adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. After the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that expansion for states should be optional, 40 states and Washington, D.C. have expanded Medicaid, accepting federal funds at a much higher rate than the match rate for non-expansion coverage.",

        "content": "One of the regular tropes from our previous exercise in self-destruction that I kept handy was the fact that the claim that “we hire only the best people” never would stop being funny. Now that we’re deep into Hell’s Encore, it’s time to trot it out again, with the caveat that it isn’t as funny the second time around. From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has hired David Geier to conduct the analysis, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Geier and his father, Mark Geier, have published papers claiming vaccines increase the risk of autism, a theory that has been studied for decades and scientifically debunked. David Geier was disciplined by Maryland regulators more than a decade ago for practicing medicine without a license. He is listed as a data analyst in the HHS employee directory.\n\nThere is, of course, absolutely no need for any study of whether vaccines cause autism. They don’t. And if you need proof, there are only a couple hundreds studies debunking the whole notion you can look up. But if you’re going to form a committee to study a nonexistent medical phenomenon, who better than a non-doctor to head it up?\n\n“It seems the goal of this administration is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t,” said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds autism research. “They are starting with the conclusion and looking to prove it. That’s not how science is done.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeatedly linked vaccines to autism. Kennedy has often cited studies by David Geier and his father, a physician, asserting that their research reveals the negative effects of vaccines. ...\n\n... During Kennedy’s confirmation hearings, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) pressed Kennedy to publicly disavow his past claims about vaccines and autism. Kennedy replied he would do so if presented with data disproving the link, despite the overwhelming body of research that already does.\n\nOf course, Cassidy, a real doctor, voted for Kennedy’s nomination anyway, because Hippocrates never had to worry about a future primary.\n\nEntrusting the nation’s health to a notorious quack already is having nationwide consequences. The measles epidemic in west Texas rages on despite the fact that Kennedy’s Patent Medicine Wagon rolled into town weeks ago. From The New York Times:\n\nParents in Gaines County, Texas, the center of a raging measles outbreak, have increasingly turned to supplements and unproven treatments to protect their children, many of whom are unvaccinated, against the virus. One of those supplements is cod liver oil containing vitamin A, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted as a near miraculous cure for measles. Physicians at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, say they’ve now treated a handful of unvaccinated children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage. Some of them had received unsafe doses of cod liver oil and other vitamin A supplements for several weeks in an attempt to prevent a measles infection, said Dr. Summer Davies, who cares for acutely ill children at the hospital.\n\nChristamighty, I can see the medical examiner’s report now: “Cause of Death: Did Own Research on Internet.”",

We deserve so much better than this.\n\nAnd Hillary Rodham Clinton was moved to succinctness:\n\nYou have got to be kidding me.\n\nIn the face of all this criticism, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who swears he’s doing all this stuff sober, responded in fluent FoxSpeak, that strange dialect understood by angry shut-ins all over America.\n\nSo you’re talking about a Deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again to include the, I don’t know, the hoaxes of Russia, Russia, Russia, or the fine people on both sides hoax or suckers and losers hoax. So this is the guy that peddles in garbage. This is what he does. I would love to comment on the Houthi campaign. Because of the skill and courage of our troops, I’ve monitored it very closely from the beginning, and you see, we’ve been managing 4 years of deferred maintenance under the Trump administration. Our troops, our sailors were getting shot at as targets. Our ships couldn’t sail through. And when they did shoot back, it was purely defensively or at shacks in Yemen. President Trump said no more. We will reestablish deterrence. We will open freedom of navigation. And we will ultimately decimate the Houthis, which is exactly what we’re doing as we speak from the beginning overwhelmingly details.\n\nI feel safe in my assumption that Secretary Hegseth wouldn’t know Jeffrey Goldberg if he sat in his lap. So what we got from the secretary as regards one of the most hilariously obvious exercises in incompetence was a tangle of Trumpian conjuring words designed to make all the scandals disappear. And some tough-guy posturing that was effective on the couch with Harris Faulkner but that is Punch-and-Judy bafflegab in the real world.\n\nAnd the president?\n\nI don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it’s a magazine that’s going out of business.\n\nWhere are the clowns?\n\nDon’t bother. They’re here.",

        "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Attributed to the late Casey Stengel, and in reference to the 1962 New York Mets, who reached heretofore unprecedented depth in their mediocrity, this not only gave the late Jimmy Breslin a great title for a book on the team but also blessed the English language with a glorious idiom for abject incompetence.\n\n“Can’t anybody here play this game?” Casey lamented.\n\nCasey died in 1975, but I’m sure that, wherever he’s sitting in heaven’s Malaprop Cafe, he wouldn’t mind if we applied his existential musings to the current presidential administration—specifically, in this case, to the Department of Defense and its current jefe, Pete Hegseth, who swears he’s doing all this stuff while sober. From The Atlantic:\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen. I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing. This is going to require some explaining.\n\nI would think so.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nWhew. Paranoia strikes deep. Sufficient to out current moment, of course. But one thing we can be sure of is that, if the administration did set up a Veritas-style ratfck, they were better-than-even money to screw it up. And one of the ways we know that is that the actual facts of this particular situation are a spectacular example of utter incompetence.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.” A message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.” ...\n\n\n\n... The term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nThe gob, it is smacked.\n\nThese guys organized a meeting to discuss a military strike and nobody thought to ask, “Gee, fellas, isn’t it kind of weird that we invited the editor of The Atlantic to this top-secret strategy conference?” Or nobody bothered to check the call list, and I guess we’re lucky they didn’t invite Oprah or Jim Cantore.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nDon’t just take his word for it.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nThe answer to the Stengel Question is, in this case, nobody.",

        "content": "This may turn out to mean nothing. We’ve had too many experiences with Chief Justice John Roberts in performance as a tower of Jell-O to count any chickens. But there does seem to be a general brawl shaping up between the executive and judicial branches. The president went out of his way to pick a fight on Wednesday by calling for the impeachment of federal district judge James Boasberg, who ordered a two-week pause in the administration’s human-trafficking operation. The president took to his social-media site to explain his reasoning in the sane and lucid manner to which we’ve become accustomed.\n\nThis Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY. I’m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!! WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\n\nLincolnesque, I tells ya.\n\nFor some reason, this spasm set off the Bat Signal in Roberts’s brain, so he did something he almost never has done. He politely told the president to pound sand. From Politico:\n\n“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,” Roberts said Tuesday in a rare and brief statement issued just hours after Trump publicly joined demands by his supporters to remove judges he called “crooked.”\n\nBoy, the chief really threw the handbill at him there.\n\nI’m not sure this even qualifies as “pushback.” That will come, if it ever does, when these multiple abuses of office come before Roberts and his colleagues and when, after that, the president ignores a Supreme Court ruling that goes against him. Until then, I guess, we take what we can get. You will notice that nowhere in this post do I use the word institutionalist. Fool me once, chief...",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "They’ve done everything except hang a sign at every port of entry reading, CLOSED: UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT. From The Washington Post:\n\nCanadians are skipping trips to Disney World and music festivals. Europeans are eschewing U.S. national parks, and Chinese travelers are vacationing in Australia instead. International travel to the United States is expected to slide by 5 percent this year, contributing to a $64 billion shortfall for the travel industry, according to Tourism Economics. The research firm had originally forecast a 9 percent increase in foreign travel, but revised its estimate late last month to reflect “polarizing Trump Administration policies and rhetoric.”\n\nThis moment isn’t without precedent. Sacks notes that international tourism slowed sharply during the first Trump presidency, amounting to roughly $20 billion in unrealized revenue, even before covid-related disruptions. Back then, it was tourists from Mexico, China and the Middle East who were pulling back, deterred by the administration’s travel bans, tariffs and tough talk on immigration. This time, Canada—the top source of international travel to the United States—is poised to lead the way. Trump has for weeks said he wants to make the country a “51st state.” In response, Canada’s former prime minister, Justin Trudeau, urged Canadians not to vacation in the United States.\n\nPeople don’t want to come here any more. Come April, here in Boston, the administration may have a worse effect on international participation in the Boston Marathon than the pandemic did. In three years, Los Angeles is due to host the Olympics and the Paralympics, and it’s hard to imagine we’ll have regained the trust of the world by then.\n\nAnd then there are all the other reasons people have to come to this country that, in its previous generosity, it shared with the world. No more Japanese people on the Freedom Trail up here. No more Brits visiting Independence Hall in Philadelphia to show they don’t hold any grudges. No more Brazilians, or Costa Ricans, or, God help us, Venezuelans staring awestruck into the Grand Canyon. And, what the hell, the government doesn’t care about national parks anymore anyway.\n\nBertha Lopez, who is from Mexico and lives near Toronto, used to cross the U.S. border every few weeks to buy staples like butter and cheese. This year, she’s stopped all of that — and vows not to set foot in the United States for at least a few years. She recently canceled a trip to Arizona to visit a longtime friend whose husband is ill; instead, she’s buying her friend a ticket to visit her in Canada this summer. “All of this talk of making Canada the 51st state has been upsetting. It’s just incredibly offensive,” the 54-year-old said. “So I’m doing what I can: No more Tide. No more Coca-Cola. No more Disney. And barring a funeral or someone in the hospital, I am not going to the United States.”\n\nForgive us, world, for we knew damn well what we were doing.",

        "title": "Newly Minted Wing-Nut Darling Justin Eichorn Got Charged with Attempting to Solicit a Minor Online",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where Momma’s in the kitchen, and she ain’t got no shoes.\n\nIt was a target-rich environment out there this week, and we begin with the winner of this week’s FAFO Medal—Minnesota Republican state senator Justin Eichorn. He achieved some fame in wing-nut circles by proposing that the state’s legislature declare “Trump Derangement Syndrome” a legitimate form of mental illness. Chuffed by his newfound eminence among the goobers, Eichorn apparently decided to make a phone call. From the AP:\n\nGOP Sen. Justin Eichorn, 40, of Grand Rapids, was arrested in Bloomington on Monday in an undercover operation targeting commercial sex involving juveniles. Investigators had placed multiple ads online offering sex for money, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Court documents indicate Eichorn started sending messages in response to the ads March 11. “I saw your post and (sic) chance you are still available tonight?” one asked, according to an FBI affidavit, while a later message asked, “What’s a guy gota do to get with the hottest girl online tonight.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nEichorn exchanged messages with an undercover officer posing as a 17-year-old girl over several days, asking about pricing for various sex acts and requesting a picture, the affidavit said. They arranged a meet-up on Monday, where he arrived to find police ready to arrest him. Officers seized two cellphones, a condom, and $129 in cash, it said.\n\nPoor guy. Seems like all he wanted was to FA and all that happened was that he FO in a big way. What’s left for the guy? “FI” and “FUM,” I guess.\n\nWe move along to the Commonwealth (God save it!), where The Boston Globe’s Spotlight unit locked onto some serious police misconduct in the area of confidential informants in the city of New Bedford.\n\nWithin the department, Jorge Santos was a rising star. Barely 30, he was part of a specialized squad—the marine unit—tasked with overseeing a stretch of the city’s busy waterfront. Brash and aggressive, he won raves for his work ethic from supervisors, his impressive arrest totals recounted in the local media. In policing’s vernacular, he was a worker, the kind of hard-charging officer who delivered the stats that made bosses look good.\n\nAmong many in the department’s rank-and-file, however, Santos had a far different reputation. He’d long been known as a loose cannon, a reckless officer who cut corners and maybe more. A colleague in the marine unit had warned police higher-ups that Santos was a liability. Officer Mark Raposo told supervisors he would no longer back up Santos on calls because he didn’t want to put himself in legal jeopardy.\n\nThe story goes on to describe a bizarre scene aboard a fishing boat in which a New Bedford police officer, responding to a disturbance call on the boat, found himself in the middle of a scrum involving the boat’s crew and another member of the New Bedford PD.\n\nNow, Raposo was getting radioed by dispatch and ordered to sort out what exactly was happening aboard the Little Tootie.\n\nScreaming. Fighting. Shouts about drugs and money. And in the middle of the scrum stood his colleague, Santos, mumbling about a “confidential informant.”\n\nRaposo stood there, befuddled. What was his colleague—off-duty, armed, alone, and without a warrant or any paperwork—doing here in the middle of the night, tussling with some out-of-town fishermen? This wasn’t some clandestine police operation, Raposo thought. It was a robbery, a “drug rip,” in Raposo’s words. The perpetrator was a fellow cop. And the supposed confidential informant behind it? Probably a fabrication, Raposo figured.\n\nOh, lovely. Overuse of confidential informants has resulted in serious abuse of the concept of confidential informants. (According to Spotlight’s examination of what records they could squeeze out of the state’s various police departments, nine out of every ten drug busts in the Commonwealth—God save it!—depended vitally on the use of CIs. The other installments in the Spotlight series describe how the rise of New Bedford’s current police chief was fueled by his making busts based on what he said was information from CIs, and an account by a former CI about his terrifying life in Kafkaland in a Massachusetts prison.\n\n“ ‘Confidential informant’ is really a misnomer, because they’re not providing just confidential information,” said Lance Block, a Florida-based attorney who has helped craft legislation aimed at establishing protections for informants. “I call them ‘civilian operatives’ ... because they’re doing what police officers do.” He questions the whole premise. “We don’t use civilians to direct traffic at a football game, and yet we’re going to use civilians to go undercover and potentially put their life at risk?” he adds. “It just makes no sense.”\n\nWe hop on our pirogue and choogle on down to LOO-si-yana where Governor Greg Landry is letting his bon temps rouler in the state’s death chambers. From Bolts:\n\n\n\nSince taking office as governor in January 2024, Landry has signed a flurry of bills functionally abolishing parole going forward, granting police greater immunity, and moving all 17-year-olds into the adult criminal system, even those accused of minor crimes. But the symbolic heart of Landry’s “tough on crime” agenda has been his drive to resume state-sponsored killings. In 2018, Landry had criticized then-Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, for not doing enough to jumpstart executions. Once governor, he did not mince words: “Capital punishment is lawful, and we intend to fulfill our legal duty to resume it,” he told legislators at the start of a special legislative session on crime that he called as one of his first official acts as governor.\n\nThe session was a blitzkrieg: Over the nine days it met, the Republican-controlled legislature reauthorized execution by electrocution and legalized nitrogen hypoxia. It also passed a “secrecy statute” that shields execution procedures from scrutiny, rendering them easier to carry out and harder to challenge. In February, Landry announced that the state had formalized a protocol for nitrogen killings. Three executions were quickly scheduled back to back in March. Then, nearly as quickly, one was taken off the calendar after it became clear that the prisoner in question hadn’t exhausted his appeals. Another execution scheduled for this month didn’t happen after the 81-year-old who was slated to be killed died of natural causes.\n\nThe piece centers on one death-row inmate named Chris Duncan and alleges that he may have been framed by a couple doctors who claimed to specialize in “forensic odontology”—i.e., bite marks—but whose work had been steadily discredited by other specialists in that field. (A video emerged that seemed to show one of these doctors using a mold of Duncan’s teeth to inflict the bite marks on the corpse of the victim, a young girl.) This occurred as bite-mark evidence itself was losing its credibility in court.\n\nIt wasn’t just Hayne and West, though: Bite mark analysis itself was being debunked. As of last year, [Journalist Radley] Balko told me, “every single scientific body to evaluate the merit of bite mark analysis has said there’s no scientific merit to it whatsoever.” During a 2012 deposition, even West changed his tune, saying, “I no longer believe in bite mark analysis. I don’t think it should be used in court,” though he would later continue to defend the practice in media interviews. Today, it routinely gets dismissed as junk science. “This bite mark stuff—it’s, I think the legal term is total bullshit,” Stafford Smith said.\n\nDuncan’s effort to secure a new trial is still hanging fire. All that’s changed is that Landry is now governor and he’s dedicated himself to limiting the appeals process that kept Duncan alive long enough to expose the two forensic “experts” as quacks. Bad enough that so many politicians are so determined to kill people, but there’s no reason to be quite so gleeful about it.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Outdoor Café Specialist Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of a state legislature grown exhausted by an excess of democracy. From Tulsa Public Radio:\n\nSenate Bill 1027 would limit the number of initiative petition signatures that could come from high-population areas and would require anyone collecting signatures to be an Oklahoma registered voter. The measure is headed to the state House after the full Senate approved it on Tuesday with a party-line vote of 36-8. The bill would require that no more than 10% of signatures on an initiative petition could come from a county where 400,000 or more people reside. That would affect only residents of Tulsa and Oklahoma counties by capping the total share of signatures from those two counties at 20%.\n\nNaturally, you don’t want signatures collected where the most people live because math is hard. That those two counties happen to be the state’s most heavily Democratic ones is purely coincidental, I am sure.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "As much as I abhor the cliché, the video really does look like something out of a movie—one of the Mission: Impossible sequels, maybe, or Taken 25. A young woman in a white coat is confronted on a sidewalk in Somerville, Massachusetts, right here in the U.S.A., by a group of masked individuals in dark clothing. The young woman does not put up a struggle as she is placed in restraints and shuffled off into a dark-colored SUV and gone. The whole thing takes two minutes and three seconds. A little slice of East Germany for you nostalgics out there.\n\nFrom The Boston Globe:\n\nPlainclothes officers handcuffed Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish national in the US on a student visa, and loaded her into an unmarked SUV with tinted windows as she pleaded for explanations, according to video of the arrest. She was transferred to Louisiana despite a federal judge ordering US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tuesday night not to remove Ozturk from Massachusetts without prior notice.\n\nThe precise timing of Ozturk’s transfer to Louisiana and the issuance of the judge’s order was unclear. It was also unclear why the government targeted Ozturk, who is doctoral candidate at Tufts department of child study and human development. She had voiced support for the pro-Palestinian movement at Tufts, but was not known as a prominent leader. Her lawyer said she is not aware of any charges against her. “I don’t understand why it took the government nearly 24 hours to let me know her whereabouts,” her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said. “Why she was transferred to Louisiana despite the court’s order is beyond me. Rumeysa should immediately be brought back to Massachusetts, released, and allowed to return to complete her PhD program.”\n\nThis comes after border czar Tom Homan has made Boston a particular focus of his attention and admitted the other day that some of the 370 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during a six-day operation were not criminals but “collaterals.”\n\nThe proximate cause of Ozturk’s being disappeared off a public street and off to Louisiana is that she took a side in a foreign conflict to which the United States isn’t even directly a party. Even if it were, of course, there would be no excuse for snatching people off the street and shipping them off to detention without even a wave at due process, in defiance of the constitutional guarantee of habeas corpus and contrary to an order from a federal court.\n\nYes, there are similar precedents in American history going all the way back to the passage of the Alien Enemies Act, the 18th-century law that so appeals to the president’s medieval lizard brain. And yes, more recently, there has been the long, slow slide toward authoritarianism, most notably during the Cointelpro days in the 1960s and, especially, in the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11, which saw wars of choice, a concentration camp in Cuba, extraordinary rendition, black sites all over the globe, and a torture regime that attempted to camouflage barbarism with euphemism. And even with a change of administrations, there were drone strikes until hell wouldn’t have them, rubble bouncing and gratuitous death. And, of course, back home, a bipartisan consensus against true accountability, exercised through direct stonewalling and, more delicately, through “looking forward, not back,” and the Constitution be damned.\n\nAll that being said, this video is different by an order of magnitude. This is an illegitimate act of political kidnapping, straight out of the Pinochet–Videla–Ríos Montt playbook. And it is no longer an isolated incident. ICE put the bag on another grad student, this one at the University of Alabama. From The Guardian:\n\nA spokesperson for the state’s flagship university said in a brief statement that a student was arrested “off campus” by federal immigration officials, but declined to comment further, citing privacy laws. The US government’s justification for detaining the student was not immediately clear, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday. News of the arrest comes amid reports of the Trump administration increasingly targeting college students for arrest and deportation across the country, including people in the US on visas and permanent residents with green cards, raising alarms on campuses and in surrounding communities.\n\nThis is about rescinding valid immigration status for the purposes of being Bibi Netanyahu’s international goon squad, squashing dissent against his government by illegitimately using the power of our own. There was a time in my life that this would leave me in an ungovernable rage. Now I’m hardly surprised.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who swears that he’s been doing all this stuff sober, had a real bad Wednesday morning for himself. It followed a Tuesday Senate hearing in which the heads of the various intelligence branches tried to wriggle out from under the scandal regarding how the editor of The Atlantic was invited onto a chat concerning an imminent attack in Yemen. (Why are we killing people just to make the rubble bounce in Yemen? Good question.) His colleagues were quick to dive behind the excuse that no “war plans” were discussed on the chat, so what’s the big deal, dude? That alibi lasted less than a day. From the AP:\n\nIn the group chat, Hegseth posted multiple details about the impending strike, using military language and laying out when a “strike window” starts, where a “target terrorist” was located, the time elements around the attack and when various weapons and aircraft would be used in the strike. He mentioned that the U.S. was “currently clean” on operational security.\n\n“Godspeed to our Warriors,” he wrote.\n\n“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)” “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)” “1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)” “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)” “1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”“MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”\n\nAnd now the punchline.\n\n“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nShortly after The Atlantic published these receipts, the same vaudeville troupe from the intelligence community appeared before the House Intelligence Committee. Their act got roughly the same reception from the committee’s Democratic minority as it did from the Senate a day earlier. Except, of course, the latest revelations from The Atlantic necessitated some adjustments to their routine. Now, since “war plans” were indeed discussed on the chat, their primary excuse was that nothing that was discussed was classified. Rep. Joaquin Castro was unconvinced by this latest improv. First up for Castro was NSA director General Timothy Haugh:\n\nCastro: “If your organization, your agency, intercepted something like this from Russia or China or some other country, would you consider this classified information?”\n\nHaugh: “We would classify based off of our sources and methods. It would be classified based off of our collection. Based off of the protection of our own source and method, not necessarily based off the content, but how we collected that information.”\n\nCastro: “But, it would be classified? ... If you did your job and collected it from the Russian Foreign Ministry and the National Security Advisor and the Secretary of Defense and the President’s Chief Advisor—there is no way—no way, having sat on this committee for nine years, that somebody would come in with that information and give us something that says ‘unclassified—you can walk out of this room with this information and give it to whomever you want.’ ”\n\nAfter finishing with Haugh, Castro turned his attention to director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe, both of them former colleagues of his in the House.\n\nCastro: “You know, with all respect—you and I worked on the committee at the same time. Tulsi, you and I came in together. We’ve never had, I’ve never had an issue or beef with you. John, you and I are both from Texas—y’all know that’s a lie. It’s a lie to the country.”\n\nIt’s clear that events are starting to shuffle Hegseth toward the door. His fate now completely depends on his president’s stubborn refusal ever to admit to a mistake. The same can be said to be true of so much of the country, which is beginning to wish this vaudeville show had closed out of town.",

For the moment, however, let’s not ask for the moon here. It’s time to press hard on the grunts carrying those orders out. They’re all complicit in illegal acts. They’re all arguably involved in a conspiracy to obstruct justice because of their involvement in defying legitimate orders of the federal courts. Arrest the ICE agents. Arrest the guards. Hell, arrest the pilots who flew the prison planes to El Salvador; arrest whoever slapped the cuffs on Mahmoud Khalil and whoever it was who hustled him off into the night. Arrest enough of them and, maybe, there will be fewer people willing to hide beneath the smoke screens of the administration and its clownish legal teams, by which I definitely include the entire Department of Justice. Let them all argue that they were “just following orders,” but let them do it in court, in public, while wearing ankle irons. Maybe if we lock enough of them up, temporarily, we can instigate a wildcat job action in defense of our battered republic.\n\nDo I believe any of this is legal? I have no idea, but I’m operating on the administration’s own approach to law enforcement, which can be accurately defined as “What the hell, give it a try anyway.” That seems to be working pretty well for them. Let’s feed them their own oysters for a while.\n\nAnd while we’re at it, can we see if White House frontwoman Karoline-with-a-K Leavitt is one of those aliens from V who can unhinge her lower jaw and eat a live rat whole? The woman is the living embodiment of Hamlet’s conclusion that “one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.” On Monday, she was asked about the White House’s using an app meant to help migrants as an encouragement to self-deport, and she referred to how the White House disseminated a video of Salvadoran soldiers and police officers brutalizing the subjects of the administration’s human-trafficking program. This is what she said:\n\n“I would have to check in with the Department of Homeland Security, but it’s a great question,” Leavitt said when asked if any migrants have self-deported, “and we’re very proud to repurpose this app, which the Biden administration abused to facilitate the mass illegal entry of illegal immigrants into our country. It was like a fast pass at Disneyland. That’s not happening under this administration. We are encouraging illegal immigrants to actively self-deport to maybe save themselves from being in one of these fun videos.”\n\n“Fun videos.”\n\nSmile and smile...",

        "content": "By happy accident, or by the intervention of a giddy Deity, on Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee had scheduled its annual national threat assessment hearing. This brought before the committee Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, FBI director Kash Patel, CIA director John Ratcliffe, and a couple of other members of the intelligence community one day after it was revealed that the editor of The Atlantic had been invited to a group chat with most of these people regarding the imminent attack by the United States on Houthi rebels in Yemen. It surely comes as no surprise that the tap-dancing from the witness table was something unseen on TV since the last time TCM ran Singin' In The Rain.\n\nThe general subtext of the testimony was a not-subtle attempt to shift the blame to people who weren't there—to National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and even to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Meanwhile, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were parboiled by Democratic senators as they first tried to dodge the fact that they were on the group chat and, when called on that, they either claimed that there was nothing classified discussed on the chat, or that they couldn't talk about certain subjects because they were, well, classified. Ratcliffe had a particularly hard time; for a CIA director, he didn't seem to have much to do with intelligence, in any sense of the word. First, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado lit him up.\n\nI am curious about whether... did Jeff Goldberg somehow—did he create a hoax that allowed him to become part of this Signal thread? Please answer the question. Don't insult the intelligence of the American people. Did he invite himself to the signal thread?\n\nDir. Ratcliffe: I do not know how he was invited...\n\nThen, Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia asked Ratcliffe simply if the inclusion of Goldberg on the chat was a \"huge mistake.\" Ratcliffe went into a buck-and-wing, denying that the inclusion of the journalist was a \"huge mistake.\" Ossoff went into orbit.\n\nThat was not a huge mistake? They characterized it as an embarrassment. This is utterly unprofessional. There has been no apology. There has been no recognition of the gravity of this error. By the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content.\n\nThis thing is not over. Not by a long shot.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Yes, folks. He’s nutty as the Christmas fruitcake. From The New York Times:\n\nInstead of culling birds when the infection is discovered, farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Mr. Kennedy said recently on Fox News. He has repeated the idea in other interviews on the channel.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, your latest dispatch from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAnd he’s not alone.\n\nMr. Kennedy does not have jurisdiction over farms. But Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, also has voiced support for the notion. “There are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity,” Ms. Rollins told Fox News last month.\n\nImmunologists are aghast.\n\n“That’s a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas.\n\nShe has a gift for understatement.\n\nSince January 2022, there have been more than 1,600 outbreaks reported on farms and backyard flocks, occurring in every state. More than 166 million birds have been affected. Every infection is another opportunity for the virus, called H5N1, to evolve into a more virulent form. Geneticists have been tracking its mutations closely; so far, the virus has not developed the ability to spread among people. But if H5N1 were to be allowed to run through a flock of five million birds, “that’s literally five million chances for that virus to replicate or to mutate,” Dr. Hansen said.\n\nEvidently, Mr. Secretary thinks that he’s Walter Reed in Cuba, except using chickens and not human volunteers. The super-immune chickens will Tell Us Something.\n\nMr. Kennedy has suggested that a subset of poultry might be naturally immune to bird flu. But chickens and turkeys lack the genes needed to resist the virus, experts said. “The way we raise birds now, there’s not a lot of genetic variability,” Dr. Hansen said. “They’re all the same bird, basically.” Public health regulations would forbid the very few birds that might survive an infection from being sold. In any event, those birds might only be protected against the current version of H5N1, not others that emerge as the virus continues to evolve. “The biology and the immunology doesn’t work that way,” said Dr. Keith Poulsen, the director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\nThere's a lot wrong with how we factory-raise our food, especially the animate foodstuffs. But it can only be solved through vigorous government regulation—which, as we know, gives President Musk the vapors, so much so that he's already screwed the pooch on this very thing, forcing the Department of Agriculture to bail out both him and the president he theoretically serves. So, for the moment, there ain't nobody here but us chickens.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil. . . . Exodus, 23:1–2\n\n“I’m dedicating my life to being useful,” he says. “To my community, to my neighborhood, to my city. And to do that means letting go of some burdens of the past. Never forgetting, but forgiving. There is power in forgiving.”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\n\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

From The Guardian:\n\nIn a statement on social media, Alexandria police announced that at about 9.18am on Saturday, police responded to the 900 block of Beverley Drive following reports of an unresponsive woman. Upon arriving at the scene, authorities located a deceased woman who they later identified as 43-year-old Jessica Aber. “In a matter of protocol, an investigation is under way surrounding the circumstances of her death. The office of the chief medical examiner of Virginia will determine the cause and manner of death,” police said, without providing additional details surrounding her death.\n\nAs is—or was, anyway—the case with U.S. attorneys, Ms. Aber, who resigned on the day of Trump’s inauguration, prosecuted a wide variety of dangerous criminals.\n\nAber began her career in 2009 at the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia where she prosecuted financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime, and child exploitation cases. From 2015 to 2016, she served on an assignment as counsel to the assistant attorney general from the justice department’s criminal division. From 2016 until becoming US attorney, Aber served as the deputy chief of the criminal division for the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the US attorney’s office said.\n\nThese miscreants included a rogues’ gallery of characters, some of whom had the requisite motivation and the (theoretical) wherewithal to revenge themselves against the prosecutor(s) who put them away. From USA Today:\n\nThis is a target-rich environment for exploitative yahoos from across the political spectrum. Remember Seth Rich and ignore them all. This is a big hunk of catnip to a Department of Justice that is MAGAfied to its very core. Don't believe a word they say. We have enough real, demonstrable atrocities to concern us.",

        "content": "Sooner or later, probably when this administration looks around and sees that there is nothing left of the old republic to destroy, the foreign owners and the editors of Tiger Beat on the Potomac will stop being so goddamn fascinated by the techniques that it employed to do so. If there ever was going to be a final example of the dangers of value-free, nonjudgmental political reporting, it’s been the performance of America’s most prominent foreign-owned political tip sheet.\n\nMonday morning’s lead item was a perfect example. It was a bloodless examination of how well Elon Musk and Project 2025 mastermind Russell Vought are working an “outside-inside” strategy to destroy the federal government.\n\nMusk, the impulsive Silicon Valley billionaire, provides the public face to the bureaucracy-slashing efforts and takes the heat for the budget-cratering, employee-firing, and overall havoc-wreaking that has been unleashed on the federal government. Vought, the conservative budget wonk, brings the expertise, insider knowledge, and ideology to a dramatic downsizing that both men see as necessary and transformational, four former Trump administration officials told POLITICO.\n\nIs “havoc-wreaking” a bad thing that ought to be deplored? Not their department, says Politico. And Vought was considered a fringe crackpot until he got the money to carry out his fantasies and the ear of a president who doesn’t know anything about anything. Now the richest man in the world and a career apparatchik, both in the employ of a grifter in chief and working with a congressional majority apparently assimilated into the ruling Borg, have managed to wreck the place with impunity. Again, I ask, is havoc-wreaking a bad thing? I always thought it was. But then again, I’m not a “former Trump administration official.” Fine sourcing there.\n\nOne of the former administration officials called Musk a “game changer” for Vought. Without Musk, “it would have been more confined to what OMB can do versus sending roving gangs of people to the agencies and doing, like, a hostile takeover,” the former official said.\n\nGreat. Bureaucratic thuggery in service of a shakedown and a “hostile takeover” of agencies that actually belong to all of us. Is this a bad thing? Not our department, says Politico.\n\nBut critics argue that approach has been sloppy, cruel, and chaotic, leaving many federal workers fearful of whether they’ll have a job when they show up to work the next morning and slashing budgets that they say provide necessary services. Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said that Musk’s “reign of chaos furthers much of what Vought desires” but doubted whether what he called their “marriage of convenience” would last.\n\n“Critics argue” whether the approach has been “sloppy” and “chaotic”? And some head of a non-profit you’ve never heard of thinks a Musk–Vought split is somehow inevitable. My God, you don’t have to be a “critic” to “argue” that there aren’t “tens of millions” of people over 100 receiving Social Security, or that firing 350 staffers at the National Nuclear Security Administration, and then trying to hire them back only to find that nobody had thought to obtain their current contact information, was no way to run a government. And waiting for the Musk–Vought schism is not a tenable strategy for the survival of democratic government.\n\nNot their department, says Politico.",

        "content": "’Fi were king of the forest, and I had a friend who was a know-nothing dilettante, a dude with a couple billion dollars’ worth of business dealings with China, and a ketamine fan into the bargain, I might think twice about something like this. From The New York Times:\n\nAnother official said the briefing would be China focused, without providing additional details. A fourth official confirmed Mr. Musk was to be at the Pentagon on Friday, but offered no details. Hours after news of the planned meeting was published by The New York Times. Pentagon officials and President Trump denied that the session would be about military plans involving China. “China will not even be mentioned or discussed,” Mr. Trump said in a late-night social media post. It was not clear if the briefing for Mr. Musk would go ahead as originally planned. But providing Mr. Musk access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded military secrets would be a dramatic expansion of his already extensive role as an adviser to Mr. Trump and leader of his effort to slash spending and purge the government of people and policies they oppose.\n\nSomehow, I am rarely reassured by what is said by the president in “late-night social media” posts. Neither am I reassured by the fact that the Pentagon is currently run by a former Jägermeister spokesmodel.\n\nPentagon war plans, known in military jargon as O-plans or operational plans, are among the military’s most closely guarded secrets. If a foreign country were to learn how the United States planned to fight a war against them, it could reinforce its defenses and address its weaknesses, making the plans far less likely to succeed. The top-secret briefing that exists for the China war plan has about 20 to 30 slides that lay out how the United States would fight such a conflict. It covers the plan beginning with the indications and warning of a threat from China to various options on what Chinese targets to hit, over what time period, that would be presented to Mr. Trump for decisions, according to officials with knowledge of the plan.\n\nLastly, I am not reassured by the fact that, if it ever came to guns with China, this guy’s creations would be fighting for both sides, and not just because whatever it is he manufactured is even money to glitch itself into the Mariana Trench shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nLosing Democracy by the Dose—A Novel.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Our friends, the International Consortium for Investigative Journalists, have taken their act to sea these days, tracking some serious Russian maritime mischief in and around the Mediterranean—specifically, running guns to Libya and ferrying various types of contraband to various other places on ships of dubious provenance.\n\nThe documents show how commercial vessels—known as a ghost fleet—employed a range of tricks to avoid detection as they shipped Russian equipment to Libya. They also highlight growing European concerns about Russia’s influence in the country, which officials believed was part of a broader strategy by Moscow to project power in the Mediterranean and several African countries.\n\nAfter Isik posted the photographs, Interpol prepared a report on the Barbaros that found the vessel had manipulated its Automatic Identification System (AIS), the device that transmits information about a ship’s location, in an attempt to conceal its position. The report also found the ship had changed its name three times and had registered itself under the flag of a different country at least 10 times since 2013. The report assessed that the ship “may be carrying firearms destined for Libya” and recommended that authorities closely monitor it.\n\nThree name changes? Ten different flags? There are protected witnesses with less complicated CVs.\n\nRussia’s ghost fleet has enriched Moscow by helping it evade Western sanctions on its oil sales, according to the United States and European Union. Whether carrying oil or arms, these vessels often manipulate their AIS to avoid detection. In dozens of reports produced in 2024, European authorities tracked how vessels turned off their AIS when passing near the Syrian port of Tartus, where Russia maintains a naval base. Sometimes, these ships also spoofed their AIS data to appear in a different place than where they actually were. In another case, according to a report included in the leaked documents, a vessel suspected of shipping arms from Syria to Libya manipulated its location to appear offshore the Lebanese capital of Beirut—but mistakenly transmitted its location as on dry land at the airport, rather than the maritime port.\n\nThe Russians were a lot less clever when they were a bunch of broke Communists.\n\nTheir economy is a den of thieves. Their military is in shambles. They are ruled by a strongman who doesn’t even pretend to be anything but a kleptocrat any more and who seems perpetually to be one step ahead of a panicked flight to Bimini. Yet, despite all that, they still have the wherewithal to run an operation like this, and to sublet an American administration ... twice.\n\nAccording to a leaked briefing document, the head of the EU naval mission was advised in June that the number of Russian flights to Libya in the first half of 2024 matched the total for all of 2023, and that the mission had observed “a formalization of the Russian presence” over the past year. The document also described an increase of Russian military shipments to the country. “A Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean is a fact and we see regular navy visits to [Libya],” the briefing document stated. Mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company that had been operating in Libya since at least 2018, were supplanted in 2024 by the Africa Corps, a unit under the direct control of Russia’s military, the leaked documents reported.\n\nThe Africa Corps. Tobruk. This all seems familiar somehow.\n\nLibya represents “an immediate security issue for Europe” because of Russia’s presence there and the African nation’s role as a migration route, according to the internal summary following the meeting with the German envoy. “It’s a testament to Western strategic negligence,” said El Gomati, the Sadeq Institute director. “Russia has been constructing a military node that is not only capable of destabilizing Libya but also threatens European security 400 miles from NATO’s shores.”\n\nNegligence is doing a lot of work at having a kind meaning in that sentence.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nThere is an angry talking yam loose in Our Nation’s Capital, and we all ought to be calling our congresscritters to tell them not to go out without armed guards and huge amounts of anti-yam repellent. On Thursday, it was reported that the Department of Defense would be briefing a certain unelected ketamine proponent on the country’s secret war plans for a possible conflict with China. The angry talking yam began storming around Pennsylvania Avenue, eating its own liver.\n\nElon Musk will be briefed by the Pentagon about the USA’s top secret plans against China should there be a War, according to the Failing New York Times, one of the worst and most purposely inaccurate newspapers anywhere in the World. Their FAKE concept for this story is that because Elon does some business in China, that he is very conflicted and would immediately go to top Chinese officials and ‘spill the beans.’ RATINGS CHALLENGED FAKE NEWS CNN immediately picked up on this absolutely ridiculous and false story, which is probably libelous, and went heavy with it. Fortunately, nobody was watching!\n\nMaggot Hagerman, the really dumb ‘scammer’ who constantly writes about me for the Times, using anonymous, made up (nonexistent!) sources, and who I haven’t spoken to in ages, is a big part of the Scam. She lead the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, only to realize that she was duped and got it wrong. She owes me a totally discredited Pulitzer Prize for her bad reporting. The Fake News is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE…And Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\n\nYou may be comforted by the fact that “Elon” indeed will not be briefed by “the Department of War,” which we haven’t had since 1947. And, anyway, Henry Knox has been dead since 1806 and is therefore unavailable for private briefings. The vulgar talking yam continues to stalk the Beltway, howling in all caps until hell won’t even have it.\n\nOver at the White House, they’ve appointed a new liaison to NASA, which once represented all that was smart and good—and, in all honesty, white—about America. His name is Darren Bossie, and he worked for the first iteration of the West Wing of Hell. He is a young man of vast experience, as The New Yorker pointed out.\n\nDarren Bossie, the new White House liaison to NASA, arrived shortly after Trump’s Inauguration. Bossie was more or less unknown at the agency, but employees soon found his LinkedIn profile. He had spent four of the past seven years bouncing around conservative politics, with a stint as Trump’s White House liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and had worked as a senior consultant for unnamed companies. For the bulk of his professional life, however—from 2006 to 2018—he had been an assistant manager at a Total Wine & More in Palm Beach County, Florida.\n\n“That didn’t seem very promising,” a senior NASA official told me.\n\nCan’t put anything past those guys.\n\nHowever, young Bossie prompted additional interest in those of us who have been tracking conservative ratfcking for a while.\n\nA review of public records, however, suggested that Darren is the brother of David N. Bossie, the president of Citizens United—the conservative group whose litigation before the Supreme Court empowered mega-donors and corporations to make unlimited contributions to political candidates.\n\nBoy howdy has David Bossie left a long trail of fcked rats behind him. He made his bones with his infamous activities against candidate, and then president, Bill Clinton. David Bossie was the guy who forced his way into the hospital room where a woman was ministering to her husband who had suffered a stroke. The woman’s daughter, Susan Coleman, had committed suicide, and Bossie claimed to believe the hoax that Coleman had killed herself because Clinton had gotten her pregnant. Bossie’s tactics have managed to get him condemned by President George H.W. Bush, fired as a congressional investigator, and even marked lousy by the first Trump administration for profiteering off the president’s image. (That’s the president’s job, dammit.) However, he forever will be a conservative hero because he was one of the leaders of a political activist outfit called Citizens United, which was used to demolish any possibility of sensible political financial reform, perhaps forever. So we all have to deal with the Bossie family again because you can’t get away from Republican buccaneering even in outer space.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Empire State Express” (Son House): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from the Roaring (if goofy) Twenties, are some popular British party games. The “forfeit” of having to sit on a bottle while attempting to light a cigarette seems to be a lot harder than you’d think it was. Just hazarding a guess here that some gin was involved off camera. On the other hand, this looks like the original source material for Eyes Wide Shut. History is so cool.\n\nMy God, this is an historic first. From Washington Monthly:\n\nMaybe it’s time for J.D. Vance to face some questions. Vance’s favorability is worse than Harris’s at the same two-month mark and perhaps worse than any new vice president in the history of polling. His Real Clear Politics favorable-unfavorable rating is 41.7 percent-44.8 percent, a slightly worse net favorable rating (-3.1 percentage points) than Donald Trump’s (-0.9). When looking only at March polling—sampled after his infamous Oval Office hectoring of Ukraine’s president—he’s even more underwater: 42.4 percent-48.0 percent.\n\nThis is pure instinctive revulsion. Vance hasn’t really done anything yet except run his mouth, get booed at the Kennedy Center, and Be There, and that’s apparently been enough.\n\nA Vance ’28 campaign, I suspect, will be bogged down with immense baggage from his current stint in the public sector, without the ability to lean on any record of success in the private sector—save for a profitable book with a message that has no resemblance to anything Vance peddles today. If Trump taps a namesake to carry on his legacy, Vance will lose out on the party’s MAGA base.\n\nI think they’ve never trusted his naked ambition and, as the president appears to continue down the road of cognitive deterioration, he’s going to get blamed for every story out of the White House about how the president is headed for La La Land. Can’t say I blame the cult for this, either.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From Popular Mechanics:\n\nArchaeologists excavating a private property in Florence, Italy, discovered a 20-inch statue of Hercules missing its head, though not altogether headless. Despite no cranium on the Greek hero, the statue included details from Hercules’ mythic 12 labors, including the skin of the Nemean lion and the severed head of the Cretan bull. The statue was dated to between the middle and late Imperial age from the third to fourth centuries, A.D., according to a translated report from Italian media, making it a roughly 1,700 find. The diminutive statue depicts a nude Hercules leaning to his right on his club, adorned with the trophies from his labors. According to Greek mythology, the Oracle of Delphi advised Hercules to travel to Tiryns to serve his cousin, King Eurystheus of Mycenae, for 12 years, for which he would be rewarded with immortality.\n\nAnd I guess, in one way, ol’ Herc was rewarded. All it cost was his head.\n\nHey, New Scientist. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nA new species of dinosaur found at a Mongolian building site has the largest fully preserved claw ever found. The bipedal, herbivorous animal had only two fingers on each hand, which it may have used to grasp branches and pull them towards its mouth. The 90-million-year-old fossil—which included parts of the pelvis, both arms and hands, and numerous vertebrae—was found near Khanbogd in the Gobi desert in 2012, but it has only now been properly studied and given the scientific name Duonychus tsogtbaatari. The genus name means “two claws” and the species name honours Mongolian palaeontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar.\n\nThe researchers think the claws were an adaptation to grabbing and pulling down vegetation. With fewer fingers, each one could be stronger and more flexible, allowing for a tighter, more controlled grip, says Kobayashi. “The curved claws and extreme flexion suggest it could hook onto branches or clusters of leaves more easily,” he says. “Three fingers might have just gotten in the way, while two provided a more precise and efficient grasp.”\n\nGiant claws used merely to grab leaves? What a waste. I’m sure they can clean that up for the next movie. They lived, healthily and regularly, with plenty of roughage, to make us happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits... Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the tornadoes throughout the Southeast, and for everyone touched by floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in LA, now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.\n\n",

From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Social Security Administration website crashed four times in 10 days this month, blocking millions of retirees and disabled Americans from logging in to their online accounts because the servers were overloaded. In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones at the front desk as receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out. But the agency no longer has a system to monitor customers’ experience with these services, because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk.\n\nAnd the phones keep ringing. And ringing.\n\nThe federal agency that delivers $1.5 trillion a year in earned benefits to 73 million retired workers, their survivors and poor and disabled Americans is engulfed in crisis—further undermining its ability to provide reliable and quick service to vulnerable customers, according to internal documents and more than two dozen current and former agency employees and officials, customers and others who interact with Social Security.\n\nHeartless, because the Porcelain Man doesn’t care about any carbon-based life-form except himself, and he’s probably working on that, too. Gutless, because they wouldn’t dare come for Social Security in a frontal assault. (George W. Bush tried that, and his 2004 mandate vanished overnight.) So they weaken it from within, day after day, cut after cut, until they can claim that the system is broken and they can push it over so it shatters. The finest social-welfare program in the country’s history, as transformative a public-policy victory as any other, and it is being crippled unto death by a South African blow-in with enough money to buy the future so he can trash it.\n\nLeland Dudek—the accidental leader elevated to acting commissioner after he fed data to Musk’s team behind his bosses’ backs—has issued rapid-fire policy changes that have created chaos for front-line staff. Under pressure from the secretive Musk team, Dudek has pushed out dozens of officials with years of expertise in running Social Security’s complex benefit and information technology systems. Others have left in disgust.\n\nHe sounds like a swell fella. There is nobody in this administration worthy of the trust you’d give to a Gaboon viper. And that includes the guy at the top.\n\nAlarmed lawmakers are straining to answer questions from angry constituents in their districts. Calls have flooded into congressional offices. The AARP announced on Monday that more than 2,000 retirees per week have called the organization since early February—double the usual number—with concerns about whether benefits they paid for during their working careers will continue. Social Security is the primary source of income for about 40 percent of older Americans. Trump has said repeatedly that the administration “won’t touch” Social Security, a promise that aides say applies to benefit levels that can only be adjusted by Congress. But in just six weeks, the cuts to staffing and offices have already taken a toll on access to benefits, officials and advocates say.\n\n“Trump Has Said Repeatedly” may be the singularly worthless phrase in the English language.",

        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where it looks like nothing but rain.\n\nWe begin in Wisconsin, where we check in on the country’s most superheated state supreme court race and discover that a certain wealthy South African chain-saw enthusiast has decided to have his fun by perverting the democratic process one more time. From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:\n\nMusk took to X, the social media platform he owns, to announce Wednesday evening that “Scott A.” from Green Bay had won the sum for signing Musk’s “Petition in Opposition to Activist Judges.” The petition was announced late last week on the X account of Musk’s super PAC, America PAC. It offers $100 in cash to people who sign the election petition but does not mention a $1 million giveaway.\n\n“Crazy Elon ... his prices are ... INSANE!”\n\nThe $1 million giveaway was initially announced by America PAC, though the super PAC’s spending records make no mention of that payment. More than $2 million in independent expenditures in recent days have been for texting, field operations and canvassing.\n\nLet us once again thank Baal for the wisdom of former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy who, when confronted with the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, was moved to make this remark.\n\nWe now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. … The fact that speakers [editor’s note: i.e., donors] may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt. … The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\n\nGood call, Anthony.\n\nAt issue in Wisconsin is the ideological balance of the state supreme court. Democrat Susan Crawford is being challenged by career wing nut Brad Schimel. The race is now the most expensive state judicial race in history, and have I mentioned recently what a terrible idea an elected judiciary is? A Schimel victory, and a conservative majority on the Wisconsin court, likely would re-gerrymander the state legislature.\n\nMusk wrote that the next award would be announced Friday. He has spent about $20 million backing conservative Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel in Tuesday’s election, when Schimel will go head-to-head against liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. Musk’s spending has made him the single largest spender in the race that an election watchdog group has predicted could top a record-breaking $100 million in spending.\n\nCrawford’s campaign spokesman slammed Musk and Schimel over the payouts. “It turns out that Schimel is such a bad candidate that Elon Musk will spend whatever it takes to prop up Schimel’s failing campaign in a corrupt attempt to buy influence on the Supreme Court for his company’s lawsuit,” spokesman Derrick Honeyman said in a statement, referencing the lawsuit by another Musk company, Tesla, against the State of Wisconsin. “It’s corrupt, it’s extreme, and it’s disgraceful to our state and judiciary.”\n\nBut not “corrupt.” Ask Mr. Justice Kennedy.\n\nWe move along to North Carolina, where another supreme court race continues to stagger on because the Republican candidate declines to accept defeat, choosing instead to challenge a huge number of ballots on what are apparently bogus grounds. Republican Jefferson Griffin lost to incumbent Democrat Allison Riggs by 734 votes. This result has been certified through two recounts. He now has gone to a court of appeals to argue that the election rules should be changed retroactively and thousands of votes be tossed out. The grounds are spurious at best; Griffin seeks to eliminate ballots cast by voters whose registrations lacked driver’s license or Social Security numbers even though neither was required at the time of the election.\n\nAs it happens, on Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, another critical voting-rights case, this one aimed at gutting section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which is the last viable element of that landmark bill left functioning after the carefully manufactured conservative majority on the court got done with it. At issue was a court order mandating that Louisiana create a second majority-minority district. A good measure of section 2’s future is the fact that even the lawyers arguing Louisiana’s case told the court that they thought section 2 was unconstitutional but that they followed it anyway. Thanks, folks. However, the liberal justices, most notably Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noticed that one side seemed to be arguing that it could ignore an adverse ruling. As we know, there’s a lot of that going around. Jackson said:\n\nI mean, I ... am sort of concerned about your view—as seemingly expressed, and I want you to clarify it—that a court order compelling you to do something is not a good reason for you to do it.\n\nKagan, meanwhile, was struck by the fact that the people opposed to the new district kept getting beaten in court, only to come back for more.\n\nSo ... I get the idea that it did have the option to keep on finding ways to litigate this question, but ... there were ways that it could have refused to give up. I take that point. But at some point, it said ... we’ve been told we’re wrong by seven judges, and we’re going to accept that and we’re going to move on and find a map. And then the state lawyers come in and ... the record is the state lawyer says there can be no better reasons to believe that the VRA required a second majority Black district than a precedential opinion of the Fifth Circuit affirming that a map with a single majority Black district likely violated section 2. And the state lawyer talks about all the process that they went through and all—and hearing that they had and the maps that were submitted. And she says what better reason could there be for this?\n\nRepublicans simply do not lose elections. That is a hard and fast rule in American politics. They just run out the clock, and the clock never reaches zero.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Oyster Shucker Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of some ducks who seem to have a very good class action lawsuit. From KFOR:\n\nNine ducks are now recovering after diesel fuel leaked into a duck pond at the University of Oklahoma earlier this month. News 4 first reported on the ducks last week when residents voiced concerns about a strong chemical odor coming from the pond and an oily substance covering the ducks. The Department of Environmental Quality later told News 4 a power plant pump had malfunctioned, causing diesel to leak into the duck pond.\n\nOn Tuesday, News 4 learned that nine ducks were washed with a solution and are now undergoing waterproofing therapy in a special pool. While WildCare says the ducks do show signs of chemical burns, especially around the eyes, they currently don’t have any symptoms of gastrointestinal issues from swallowing the fuel. The ducks have been given medication that the organization hopes will reduce their chances of developing ulcers.\n\nSue ’em, boys. Get it while you can.\n\n\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Something interesting is happening in the chambers of the Supreme Court. The Nine Wise Souls are preparing to hear the case of Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board v. Drummond and St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School v. Drummond. At issue is a decision by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that denied public funding for a Catholic virtual charter school on the grounds that all the state’s charter schools must by law be public schools and that funding religious charter schools is unconstitutional. In January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal in the last week of April. At the time, Justice Amy Coney Barrett declined to participate in that decision. She did so without explanation.\n\nBarrett, who handed Donald Trump a conservative 6–3 supermajority when she was confirmed to the court, won’t be on the bench to hear it. She recused herself, leaving no explanation for sitting out what could be the most significant legal decision to affect schools in decades. Observers believe the cause is her friendship with Garnett, who was an early legal adviser to the school. Nicole and her husband Richard Garnett, also a Notre Dame law professor, are both faculty fellows with the university’s Religious Liberty Clinic, which represents St Isidore. In a deep irony, the longtime friendship between the two women, forged in Catholic faith and a conservative approach to jurisprudence, now threatens to tip the scales away from a cause Garnett has spent her career defending.\n\nSimply put, with Barrett’s recusal, it is now possible that the Court will split, 4–4, in which case the decision of the Oklahoma supremes would stand and the funding would be denied. This would come as an immense shock to the conservative Catholic legal community centered these days at Notre Dame.\n\nAt Notre Dame, Garnett and Barrett overlapped as faculty members for roughly 17 years. “She became a lifelong friend,” Garnett said. “She lived around the corner from us and we raised our kids together.” And when Trump introduced the mother of seven to the nation, Garnett was seated in the Rose Garden along with senators, White House officials and other dignitaries.\n\nGiven their intersecting interests, it’s very likely that school vouchers—a top conservative priority to provide students with public money to spend at non-public schools—came up in conversation. Until 2017, Barrett served as a trustee at Trinity School at Greenlawn, a private classical Christian academy in South Bend, Indiana, that participates in the state’s voucher program. Garnett, meanwhile, was honing legal arguments in favor of expanding such programs. Before joining the faculty at Notre Dame, she worked as a staff attorney for the Institute for Justice, a right-leaning law firm that has led efforts to open school choice programs to religious schools.\n\nWhen one recalls Justice Clarence Thomas’s arrogant refusal to recuse himself from hearing cases involving the January 6 insurrectionists despite his wife’s involvement in some of the surrounding events, Barrett’s decision to recuse herself here looks like high principle. It will look even more like that if one of the four remaining conservatives on the court jumps ship and creates the 4–4 deadlock. Madam Justice Barrett is becoming interesting.",

        "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Goddamn, even this? From NPR:\n\nAfter a recent change by the Trump administration, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from having segregated restaurants, waiting rooms, and drinking fountains. The segregation clause is one of several identified in a public memo issued by the General Services Administration last month, affecting all civil federal agencies. The memo explains that it is making changes prompted by President Trump’s executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion, which repealed an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 regarding federal contractors and nondiscrimination. The memo also addresses Trump’s executive order on gender identity.\n\nSeveral federal agencies, including the departments of Defense, Commerce and Homeland Security, have notified staff who oversee federal contracts that they should start instituting these changes. A recent notice from the National Institutes of Health shows that the change is already in effect. The notice, regarding a maintenance agreement for scientific freeze dryers, cites the GSA memo and reads, “FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities and FAR 52.222-26—Equal Opportunity will not be considered when making award decisions or enforce requirements.”\n\n“Equal Opportunity will not be considered...”\n\nGive my regards to 1954 and remember me to Orval Faubus. And the eye of Sauron descends on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, eventually, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nTo be clear, all businesses—those that have government contracts and those that do not—still need to follow federal and state laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes segregated facilities illegal.\n\nFor now.\n\nOn this issue, especially, I do not want to hear anything from the anti-Trump Republicans. Almost from the time Lyndon Johnson handed Dr. King the pen with which h’d signed the CRA in 1964, the Republican Party determined to derive political benefits from attaching itself to the angry remnants of American apartheid. Almost to a person, our new allies made their careers within that context and, as best as I can recall, none of them raised a moral or political objection to the largely successful rollback of the achievements of the civil-rights movement. That is the singular moral failure at the heart of modern American conservatism.\n\n(LBJ saw it coming. And what he said to Bill Moyers is the gentler American equivalent of what Michael Collins said after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921: “I have signed my own death warrant.” They were both right.)\n\nElsewhere in the backward march of history, remember the great story of the Navajo Code Talkers, the Native soldiers who used their tribal language as an unbreakable code during World War II in the Pacific? (Made a pretty good movie, too, with Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach.) Well, apparently, it’s time to forget them again. From the Military Times:\n\nMany links that previously took viewers to informational articles about the Native American service members who used their native language as an indecipherable code to help win World War I and II were no longer accessible as of Tuesday afternoon. A Pentagon spokesperson said the department was working to rectify the situation.\n\nShut up. You got caught.\n\n“The department is restoring content about the Navajo Code Talkers,” the spokesperson said. “It had previously been removed during the auto-removal process.”\n\nSomebody had to program the auto-removal process, which means a decision was made to delete the Navajo material, probably along with the records of minority Medal of Honor winners. And we all have to admit now that LBJ pretty much low-balled that prediction.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "It may be the distraction everybody says it is. It may be a shot across the bow from a corrupt president against investigators who might choose to inconvenience him. It could be both of those. But the release Tuesday of nearly 70,000 pages of heretofore classified documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy is an early Easter basket full of very interesting accounts of the covert doings of the CIA in the 1960s. And whatever the motives behind their release may be, it is all information that we should have had years ago. The good people at the National Security Archive have sorted through much of the massive information dump and filtered out some very tasty nuggets. For example:\n\nThere is a “family jewels” memo to William Colby dated June 1, 1973, at the height of the revelations regarding the CIA’s history of international dirty tricks. This one begins with a genuinely hilarious spasm of bureaucratic linguistic gymnastics.\n\nFollowing our recent conversation, I have searched my memory and Mr. McCone’s files for examples of activities which to hostile observers or to someone without complete knowledge and with a special kind of motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities exceeding CIA’s charter.\n\nA special kind of motivation like, say, telling the country what was being done in its name. Like, say, burglarizing a foreign embassy in Washington.\n\nAs a result of a developing relationship with Philippe de Vosjoli, the SDECE representative in Washington, and also as a result of certain information conveyed by Anatole Golitson, James Angleton, with the approval of Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation against the French Embassy in Washington. This involved breaking and entering and the removal of documents from the French Consulate.\n\nAlthough certain activities never got beyond the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation. One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam. A second involved a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear installations. Outside the United States Government, General Eisenhower was briefed on such planning. A third, which assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence collection against foreign installation in this country.\n\n“Which assumes a new significance today”? Oh, please, do go on.\n\nFinally, and this will reflect my Middle Western Protestant upbringing, McCone’s dealings with the Vatican, including Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.\n\nHoly Borgias, Batman. My eyebrows are on the ceiling.\n\nThere’s also a 40-page document detailing CIA meddling in elections all over the globe, as well as with a rising revolutionary movement in Yemen.\n\nAnd there’s an oblique mention that’s going to ring all kinds of bells among Oliver Stone fans.\n\nAlso in the afternoon, the Deputy Director (Plans) read to the Panel a paper on Operation Mongoose which the Director had used earlier in the day for briefing the President. This paper was used on the instruction of the Director. The Panel asked questions about agency activity in Cuba, all of which were answered with the exception of one having to do with the role of the Attorney General. This query was raised by Mr. [Gordon] Gray who recognized and gracefully accepted the fact that he not answered directly.\n\nMr. Gray, who had been the National Security Advisor during the Eisenhower administration, thus gets a gold star for being incurious.\n\nAgain, there’s very likely nothing in here that will tell us much about what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. But there’s a great deal to be said for setting the scene, and the American intelligence community was a cynical, occasionally criminal, gang. The more we know about that, the better, and the more evidence we have that JFK had the right idea in 1962 when the Bay of Pigs came a cropper. A thousand pieces, and scattered to the winds.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "content": "Every now and again, we check in with the folks at Just Security who are keeping track of the lawsuits currently active against the maladministration of the new American Golden Age. The current tally is 139 and, one suspects, climbing. Many of them make the heretofore unremarkable point that executive orders are in no way laws but, rather, policy recommendations from the executive designed to create a legislative agenda upon which Congress then would act.\n\n(Voice-over: That’s not how it works anymore.)\n\nAt the moment, of course, the administration’s record in the various courts is roughly equivalent to Germany’s in world wars. Which gave Speaker Moses an idea. From Reuters:\n\nJohnson, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, told reporters the numerous injunctions issued by judges nationally that have stymied Trump’s initiatives were part of a “dangerous trend. ... It violates separation of powers when a judge thinks that they can enjoin something that a president is doing, that the American people voted for,” Johnson said during his weekly press conference. He said the House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a hearing next week “to highlight these abuses” and had recently advanced legislation that would prevent district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions blocking policies. “We do have authority over the federal courts,” he said. “As you know, we can eliminate an entire district court. We have power over funding, over the courts and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.”\n\nNice independent judiciary you have there. Shame if anything happened to it.\n\n(Here is where I note that Speaker Moses seems unbothered by the one-man All U Can Sue wing-nut buffet being run by ol’ Judge Matt Kacsmaryk down in Amarillo.)\n\nJohnson seems prepared to give the contract over to his favorite button man, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Van Heusen), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Any judge subpoenaed by this collection of pantomime kangaroos should refuse to honor them and, if anyone threatens them, say they’ll honor Jordan’s subpoenas when he honors the January 6 select committee’s.

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Vice President J Divan Vance continues to make friends and influence nobody on the world stage. This time, the topic was the president’s lunatic dream of seizing Greenland from Denmark. (But not, curiously, making it a state, which, according to the president’s other lunatic dream, is his plan for Canada.) Because he is a good boy who deserves favor, Vance explained that the time has come once again for us to exercise the Divine Right of Lunatics. From The Independent:\n\nAsked whether he believed the U.S. could acquire Greenland during an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo in February, Vance said: “I think it’s possible, Maria. Here’s the thing which I think a lot of folks don’t appreciate about Greenland. It’s really important to our national security,” the vice president claimed. Vance explained that there are “sea lanes” surrounding Greenland, used by the Chinese and the Russians. The former Ohio senator accused the Danish government of restricting U.S. access and, therefore, “not doing its job” and “not being a good ally.”\n\nThank you, Yale dude. I never noticed that Greenland was an island and, therefore, surrounded by sea lanes. And considering that the current president—and, therefore, his good boy VP—never shuts up about seizing the place, I’d restrict our access to it as well.\n\nDuring the Fox News interview, which discussed several of Trump’s measures, Vance suggested that the only real solution to the national security issue was to take “more territorial interest in Greenland.” He stressed that Trump would take the island if necessary, saying, “That is what President Trump is going to do because he doesn’t care about what the Europeans scream at us; he cares about putting the interests of American citizens first.”\n\nSorry, Yale dude. I lived through the decades in which what was once the Soviet Union was a serious military threat to the U.S., albeit occasionally an overhyped one, and not a dead-broke kleptocracy. And in those days, we were content with the DEW line and all the other safeguards stationed in and around the Arctic. I do not wake in the night terrified about Russian fishing trawlers. And I don’t think I want to take up in a country dedicated to the geopolitics of the Reverend G.I. Grabitall.\n\nAnd as it turns out, the first commando raid of the takeover has been launched. It was led by the White House national security advisor, a hack named Mike Waltz, and Usha Vance, wife to J Divan. Their arrival was not greeted with a Laurel and Hardy handshake. From The Guardian:\n\nGreenland’s prime minister, Múte B Egede, has called for the international community to step in after it was announced that Donald Trump’s national security adviser and the US second lady will visit the Arctic island, accusing Washington of “foreign interference”. Mike Waltz and Usha Vance are due to arrive in Greenland this week as part of a delegation that will also include the US energy secretary, Chris Wright. Trump has pledged to make the autonomous territory—part of the kingdom of Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy—part of the US, “one way or the other” and has refused to rule out using military or economic force to do so.\n\nEgede reacted angrily to the White House announcement on Sunday, accusing Greenland’s allies of “hiding” and “almost whispering” their support. If the international community did not step up its support for Greenland, he warned, the situation would escalate. “Yes, the western allies stood together and helped each other through thick and thin, but it has turned upside down now with the sitting president in the USA,” he told the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n“But the fact that our other allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whispering that they support us has no effect, and if they do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.” He added: “So we need our other allies to clearly and distinctly come with their support and backing for us.”\n\nAs it happens, Egede’s party lost the last election. The winners are trying to build a coalition government right now, and the one thing they don’t need is a state visit from representatives of a country threatening a hostile takeover of the whole island. I don’t believe it’s coincidental. They’re looking at Greenland like it’s an exercise in vulture capitalism. Striking. Hot irons. That kind of thing.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Ordinarily, I stay away from the continuing forensic analysis of What the Fck Happened? The election was four months ago. The consequences are drowning us, and it’s hard enough keeping up with the fresh hell unleashed every day to go back and discuss how we all got here. However, in The New York Times on Tuesday, pollster named David Shor, and eventually they came around to a conclusion to which Shor had come from his polling. It is one of the most depressing pieces of dialogue I’ve read in a while.\n\nKLEIN: One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. This is something I was told by top Biden strategists. I don’t see democracy on here or Jan. 6 and the stability of the system. Did you test those, as well?\n\nSHOR: We did. But we did a survey where we just asked people: What’s more important right now—preserving America’s institutions or delivering change that improves people’s lives? It was 78 to 18: delivering change that improves people’s lives. One of the hardest things about being a political consultant over the last eight years is that every day Trump does terrible things—things that I think are objectively awful and scary and that [expletive] me off. Things he says, like: I’m going to prosecute my enemies. Then we do a bunch of tests, and voters really don’t want to hear about it from us. I think Trump would do better if he didn’t say those things, for sure. But voters want politicians to talk about concrete ways that they are going to improve people’s lives.\n\nAll my life, it was a given that the more democratic a system was, the better off the people would be. Hell, that was the stated reason for almost all our military and intelligence misadventures of the past 80 years. Both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson proposed economic aid for Vietnam even as they deepened American military involvement in the hopes of stimulating some sort of democratic government in Indochina. (See also: The Quiet American.) It was the stated reason for the grandiose Middle East fantasies of the PNAC crowd during the aughts. When was it that the country stopped believing that? When did we decide, en masse, that democracy and “improving people’s lives” contradicted each other? Personally, I trace it back to Ronald Reagan’s first inaugural address, which supercharged the conservative dogma that “government” was somehow an alien entity and not the creation of a commonwealth in which we all had a stake and to which we had an obligation.\n\nRegulars here at the shebeen know that I am fond of Daniel Webster’s caution against simplifying government.\n\nNothing is more deceptive or more dangerous than the pretense of a desire to simplify government. The simplest governments are despotisms; the next simplest, limited monarchies; but all republics, all governments of law, must impose numerous limitations and qualifications of authority, and give many positive and many qualified rights.\n\nThe stake we all have in a political commonwealth, and to which we have obligations, can be found in those words. In the chat between Klein and Shor can be found the death of that commonwealth. Everything else is a symptom.",

        "content": "Worried you’re not getting enough protein? For years, I didn’t. In fact, I avoided it like the plague. I thought that if I ate too much protein and worked out, I would become bulky—like those muscle men who slam weights around in the gym. It also didn’t help that I grew up in the 2000s, when cereal and granola bars were considered “health food.” Hungry in the middle of the morning? Just have some Special K!\n\nIt’s no wonder I had a bad relationship with food—I ate little more for breakfast than a bowl of fruit. I had cravings all the time, felt exhausted, and experienced mental lapses. And, for the record, my muscles were basically non-existent.\n\nOf course, I’m not alone—many people don’t consume enough protein. In fact, many people do not even include it in the first meal of the day. “For example, in Spain, we eat pan con tomate—bread with tomato—for breakfast and do not add protein,” notes nutrition expert Mariana Sánchez Díaz.\n\nThese days, however, we are getting wise to the fact that getting adequate protein is not just necessary—it is vital for women as we age. It’s also especially important to get it in the morning: Studies show that eating at least 30 grams of protein for breakfast can prevent fatigue and cravings between meals. “Eggs, Greek yogurt, or rich protein sources such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna help control appetite throughout the day while supporting a faster metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving cognitive function,” explains nutritionist and biologist Anastasiia Kaliga of the holistic wellness app Luvly.\n\nAt the very least, experts say 10% of our daily calories should come from protein. To figure that out in grams, just multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36—the result is the minimum amount of protein in grams you should aim for each day.\n\nSigns you’re not getting enough protein\n\nWhen I finally realized that I wasn’t getting enough protein for my body to function properly, it was because my menstrual cycle became irregular. (Turns out protein is important for hormones, too.)\n\nMissing periods, experts say, is just one sign you may not be getting enough protein. Other symptoms? Swelling in the hands and feet, getting sick frequently, feeling depressed, or having wounds that are slow to heal. Below, nutritionists share a few more signs of not getting enough protein.\n\nFatigue\n\n“In extreme cases, you can be tired and lack energy,” explains nutritionist Mariana Pérez-Trejo Soltwedel. “After all, consuming balanced meals—including protein—is key to keeping the immune system functioning and for regulating your hormones.”",

        "content": "We've always heard that “breakfast is the most important meal of the day,” but that's never addressed the nuance of what kind of breakfast. Because a bowl of sugary cereal? It's simply not the same as starting your day off with a balanced meal. We now know that what you eat has a major impact on your blood sugar levels and satiety—but what happens when you simply don't have time for a hearty breakfast?\n\nIt's best explained by Jessie Inchauspé, also known as the Glucose Goddess. “The starches or sugar in meals are broken down into glucose molecules that reach the bloodstream at high speed, creating a glucose spike,” she says. “And while a fruit smoothie may be tempting post-workout because you're in a rush, if you don't add in the right ingredients, you'll end up with a glucose spike that will leave you hungrier (especially after a heavy workout), lacking energy, and craving snacks between meals.”\n\nThat's where the savory breakfast comes in. “Ideally, a savory breakfast will keep you full for four hours because you're eating enough protein,” Inchauspé continues. “This is especially important for women, most of us do not get enough protein every day. We need roughly a gram of protein per pound of body weight.” In addition to helping increase muscle mass, tissue repair, and hormone balance, a high-protein breakfast will help you feel satiated for longer and the rest of the day.\n\nThe problem with fruit smoothies (as delicious as they are) is that the blender pulverizes the natural fiber found in the fruit—something needed to help maintain blood sugar. But a 9-to-5 life spares no one, and sometimes a smoothie is needed.\n\nThat's where this recipe—where protein powder is the star ingredient of a smoothie—can help. You still get a hint of sweet through the berries (also packed with antioxidants!) but don't forfeit on the much needed, blood sugar stabilizing ingredients. Bon appetit!\n\nHigh-protein breakfast smoothie\n\nIngredients",

The look was simple: a black Louis Vuitton crewneck sweater with light-wash straight-legged jeans, worn underneath a black below-the-knee coat from Maison Margiela, and a pair of black lug-sole boots.\n\nBut even Zendaya’s most pared-back ’fits are still dynamic—we wouldn’t expect any less from Law Roach’s disciple. Her knit pullover featured a pinch seam detailing on the body and a coat with a raw hem. And let’s not forget about her expert accessorizing: she shaded herself with a pair of black Bottega Veneta cat-eye sunglasses, whose slightly rounded frames added a touch of whimsy to the neutral look.

Over the past few years, stars and their stylists have looked to the past when plotting press tours and red carpets.\n\nThough there may be a finite amount of mint-condition vintage pieces available, we’ve already seen an incredible roster of celebrity vintage looks over the last several years. Perhaps nobody is a bigger fan of the archive pull than Zendaya, whose Dune: Part Two and Challenger promotions were loaded with only the highest octane fashion. Styled by Law Roach, the duo have proven themselves pure-of-heart vintage enthusiasts, buying up iconic pieces like the Thierry Mugler 1995 couture gynoid suit and spring 1996 Givenchy couture dress by John Galliano that she wore to host the 2024 Met Gala.\n\nBut Zendaya is far from the only vintage fanatic in Hollywood. Even before the vintage gold rush began, some celebrities were nurturing their archives. Laverne Cox has an impressive Mugler collection; Ashley Olsen sourced an ethereal orange vintage Christian Dior dress for the Met Gala; Kate Moss dug into Marc Jacobs’s archives to celebrate her book launch. Now, pulling looks of yore courtesy of John Galliano, Alexander McQuen, and Tom Ford are all part of a successful outing.\n\nStandout vintage moments are especially conducive with red carpet glamour: Chappell Roan attended her first-ever Grammys in a Degas-inspired Jean Paul Gaultier couture dress; Naomi Campbell walked the Croisette at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival in a black sequined Chanel dress she debuted on the runway nearly 30 years prior; Kendall Jenner hit the 2024 Met Gala in neverworn McQueen-era Givenchy couture. But they also pop in street style: Bella Hadid broke out some vintage Galliano-era Dior; Meghan Markle wore a 1965 Courregès trapeze coat as part of her maternitywear; and Jenner strutted down the streets of Paris in 1988 Alaïa.\n\nBelow, revisit 32 standout celebrity vintage fashion moments.",

        "content": "I also had no idea about Andy’s very major involvement with Transcendental Meditation. I started doing TM a year or two ago through Bob Roth, the director of the David Lynch Foundation, who’s in your film talking about Andy. I know TM is supposed to be for everybody, but still, I somehow didn’t see Andy Kaufman as someone who devoted hours every day to yoga and meditation. You have this amazing footage in the film of Andy speaking with the Maharishi, and even then he seems to be pushing the fourth wall or something in his questions to him.\n\nWe traveled to Fairfield, Iowa, which is sort of the spiritual home of TM in America, because it’s where Maharishi International University is and where a lot of these people that were friends with Andy still live—teachers of TM and such. It was obviously such a huge part of his life, and I think there were a few different things going on. One, when Andy was in his teens and early 20s, he was clearly abusing substances and kind of going down a certain path, and I think when he traded that out for meditation, that’s when everything clicked in his life—when he was able to fulfill his vision of himself to himself and for himself. It was so clear this was a well for him, a way of getting his batteries recharged, and I think a lot of ideas came to him as a result of it.\n\nBut I also felt that I was never going to really be able to understand it unless I started doing TM myself, so in the middle of the editing process I went to one of the TM centers in LA and took the course and started meditating every day—and all of a sudden, ideas were coming to me… about how to put the film together as well as how to explain this element of his life. What I realized is that both his work and his meditation practice were about shutting out everything else other than what’s happening in you in the moment.\n\nHis work as a performance artist demands total concentration and your full attention, but once you’re on that journey with him—where one second he’s a bombing comedian, and then he’s crying, but then the crying becomes rhythmical, and then that rhythm turns into a song—at the end of it all, you realize that for three minutes or eight minutes or whatever it was, you had been focusing on nothing else other than that single flame burning in front of you. It’s a type of meditation, and you come out on the other side of it and everything’s the same, but everything’s changed a little bit.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHello, Vogue.\n\nI'm Cate Blanchett, and this is My Life in Looks.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music]\n\nI'm a little nervous, but je ne regrette rien, right?\n\nOh, my giddy aunt.\n\nI think I'm wearing my mother's sweater,\n\nand it looks like my school shirt.\n\nI'm probably also wearing the underpants\n\nthat my mother made me.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago,\n\nI still had the underpants that my mother sewed.\n\nClearly not wearing any makeup.\n\nGod bless me, I look like I'm 12,\n\nbut this was at the Sydney Theater Critics Awards,\n\nand I won Best Newcomer.\n\nI was in a production of Oleanna,\n\nand then I loved it so much, I ran the company.\n\nI think I might've come straight from rehearsals.\n\nClearly, I didn't realize\n\nI was gonna be photographed or win.\n\nNext.\n\nOh, look, this is the very first time I went\n\nto the Academy Awards.\n\nI had done a shoot in Australia,\n\nand I'd fallen in love with this dress\n\nthat John Galliano had designed that was knitted,\n\nwhite knitted, and was embellished\n\nwith all of this amazing embroidery,\n\nand I met him in London\n\nand he said that he would design something for me,\n\nand he said, Let's change the color.\n\nAnd he sat down, it was like being on the couch,\n\nand he asked about my family and my marriage,\n\nand then he embellished, I think you can just see it\n\nat the bottom there, there's a little hummingbird,\n\nand there's two hummingbirds on the dress,\n\nand one was me, and one was my husband Andrew.\n\nso there's kind of a real beautiful story.\n\nI gave it to amfAR,\n\nso now someone else is wearing it, sadly. [laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue. That wasn't so painful after all.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music continues]",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "As much as I’d like to resist responding to a fat person’s art through the lens of compulsory thinness, there’s something deeply liberating about just how little interest Survival of the Thickest—and its protagonist, Mavis Beaumont—has in self-hatred. Season 2 of the series is no more focused on weight (or weight loss) than the show’s first season was: It begins with Mavis showing up at the doorstep of the wildly hot Roman do-gooder Luca (Marouane Zotti) that she quickly fell for and majorly screwed over last season by secretly accepting her cheating ex’s proposal. Hot as their initial passion is, it soon becomes clear that Luca has trouble trusting her, and Mavis returns home to New York.\n\nWhere some shows might use a fat protagonist’s breakup as an excuse for a diet montage, Survival of the Thickest instead sees Mavis revel in her singledom, throwing herself into the affirming work of building out her styling business. Eventually, at the opening of a pop-up storefront, Mavis tells the crowd that the space’s existence is “a dream come true for me and for anyone else who has cried in a dressing room because we have felt like the fashion industry has forgotten us.”\n\nI’ve literally and figuratively been there, and the part of me that worries “SkinnyTok” will put fat people right back in the dressing room of our nightmares was greatly soothed by watching a whole season of Mavis chasing her dream, loving her friends, making mistakes, and generally living her life—without wondering what said life might look like if she were thinner.\n\nIt would be great if the success of Survival of the Thickest inspired the industry powers that be to greenlight, produce, and actually promote more shows starring fat and non-straight-size people who aren’t defined by their quest to shrink their bodies. But for now, at least we have one Netflix show that actually focuses around the survival—and, what’s more, the exuberance—of an unapologetically fat character whose body is far from the most interesting thing about her.",

        "title": "I Got Meghan Markle's “Montecito Manicure”",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "“While looking at photos, I was struck by just how normal her manicure is,” Manhattan-based nail artist Julie Kandalec tells me as we sit in her private salon. Today, she's transforming my red square-shaped nails into something more Montecito Manciure-inspired. Of course, CND's Satin Slippers and Romantique are sitting nearby—Kandalec is an educator with the brand. “Right now, we really have two manicure trends: people who want custom, over-the-top nails, the more-is-more manicure, and those who want a super-neutral, goes-with-everything manicure. Obviously, she's part of the latter.”\n\nI, on the (literal) other hand, am far from subtle. I like thick lines of black eyeliner and long nails with rhinestones and color-morphing polish, so any hue of quiet luxury neutral is far from compelling. Kandalec suggests the first step toward going full Markle mani is to change my nail shape—no more sharp square nails, but instead going for a more natural rounded almond. Next, we try a few different combinations of layering the two polish shades to hit the right combo à la Meghan. “One of these polishes is a bit more pink, and the other is more white,” Kandalec says. “When there are two shades involved, you're able to do thin layers to fully customize the finished look, like Meghan has.” After a few different trials, we settle on a layer of Romantique followed by Satin Slippers, with a super-hard glossy top coat.\n\nWhen we're finished, my nails look like the beautiful little Jordan almonds handed out at the end of a wedding. They're so curated, so sophisticated—they belong to somebody reading a first-edition in a Nancy Meyers-inspired home, not on the 2 line back to Brooklyn at 10:30 p.m. But I guess it's just one of the many gifts Markle has given us through her Netflix show. It's, should we say, with love, Meghan.",

        "title": "9-5: How Tab Vintage Founder Alexis Novak Embraces the Spontaneity of Sourcing With an Avant-Garde Uniform",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "The love of the hunt was instilled in Alexis from early on; she would trawl flea markets and garage sales with her father in Denver, Colorado. Nowadays, her pursuits take her all over the world, from cross-state road trips to extended stays in Japan or Paris. As a former yoga teacher turned full-time vintage dealer in 2020, Alexis never knows who she’ll meet or what kind of gem will reveal itself to her, but she embraces the spontaneous nature of her job with an artistic, avant-garde, and mindfully-edited wardrobe that’s reflective of her cultivated taste and love of camp. Curious to see how she navigates it all? Let’s unpack her week of looks, below.\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral\n\nOn Call: Embracing the Element of Surprise\n\nWhen working closely with her tailor, Rae Moore, on alterations for clients, Alexis reaches for pieces in which she can move freely and instinctively. Here, she styles a flared Marni skirt with a square-neck tank from Vince—“a great layering piece”—and her beloved Tabi boots. She imbues interest in this all-black look with a bright red V-neck sweater from The Row—a deep-cut that’s based on a Martin Margiela for Hermès style from the fall 1998 collection, and a contemporary fashion Easter Egg she was over the moon to find. Her Elsa Peretti for Tiffany tassel pendant adds a layer of tasteful artistry.\n\nShop more deep V-neck sweaters:\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral\n\nThe Foundational Formula for Fittings—and Beyond\n\nEasy, relaxed separates make up this next tonal look—composed of a collarless Margiela men’s blazer, the same Vince square-neck cami as seen above, and a Prada maxi skirt—which Alexis will slip into whenever she needs to feel truly present. “I love being in the moment when I’m [in fittings] working on a piece, and don’t want to ever feel restricted [by my clothes],” she says of this tried-and-true formula. She’ll opt for Tabi ballet flats in the day, then switch into boots or loafer heels for after hours. A vintage Elsa Peretti piece horseshoe belt—another prized piece in her collection—breaks up the monochrome and adds intrigue and dimension to her outfit.\n\nShop more black collarless blazers and column skirts:\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral\n\nSilky Separates for No-Fuss Polish\n\nYou’ll never catch Alexis rummaging through bins in silky clothing—she reserves elegant separates like these for days packed to the brim with client meetings. “The silk top is so comfortable and relaxed, but still has that cool element to it with the oversized fit and the tight cuffs,” she says of her recently acquired Phoebe Philo design. She paired it with slouchy tailored wool trousers, also by Phoebe, and her trusty Margiela sneakers. She incorporates a sense of playfulness with her jewelry: a dainty stacking chain from Wwake— “a barely-there piece I wear every single day that’s really like a part of me now”—and an Old Céline coral deer pendant. “I like pendant necklaces because they’re a [impactful] piece of jewelry that isn’t power pearls.” Alexis isn’t print-shy, but she prefers to express herself in color stories over patterns. “I like solid hues that can be easily interchanged, and to add interest with fabrics,” she says of this ensemble that exemplifies her dressing ethos.\n\nShop more silk tops:\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral\n\nCampy Accessories Bring Artful Flair\n\nAlexis’s whimsical side—and deep fashion knowledge—is on full display here, with an outfit framed around vintage and contemporary Margiela finds: a modern knit vest atop a coordinating zip-up cardigan with “lines that match up perfectly whichever way you wear it” and a pre-loved maxi column skirt made out of old cargo pants that Alexis describes as “a tailoring feat that’s one of one.” She’d pair this outfit with sneakers for work or surrealist Phoebe Philo-era Céline heels for a lunch out. (Take a closer look at her shoes, and you’ll notice the toenails are painted red—campy dressing at its finest!) She gives this outfit complexity and an artful flair with a pendant pouch first seen on Margiela’s 1999 spring runway. “Although it’s a piece of art, it’s a functional pouch made of a vintage 1950s leather glove that Margiela sourced and found at a Parisian flea market—I use it to keep my tailoring clips and pins.”\n\nShop more cargo skirts:\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral\n\nTrompe L’Oeil Dressing\n\nTwo of Alexis’s hard-earned vintage finds shine in this transitional outfit that’s perfect for whenever she wants to leave a lasting impression. She says she stumbled upon the Margiela dress and jacket cosmically on two separate occasions, and pairing them up felt like “reuniting a family.” The jacket is a reconstruction of deconstructed vintage leather jackets with extra long sleeves that can be rolled up. “There’s no practicality to it—it’s just a new idea that I love, and Margiela was always trying to find modern ways to interpret old ideas.” The dress’s trompe l’oeil pattern is a zoomed-in photograph of a woman’s hair printed on a silk lining. Her appreciation for craftsmanship and provenance give gravitas to this look, which is once more, anchored by her vintage Elsa Peretti bottle pendant and Tabi boots.\n\nShop more trompe l’oeil dresses:\n\nJean Paul Gautier Le Classique printed stretch-jersey turtleneck maxi dress $385 NET-A-PORTER Jason Wu brushstroke print jersey dress $1,795 BERGDORF GOODMAN\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral\n\nDecisions, Decisions: The Art of Letting Go\n\nFor Alexis, the thrill of discovery is often tempered by a rush of mixed emotions: Do you hold onto this incredible piece for yourself, or do you accept being a temporary custodian and allow it to find another happy home? “There’s a fine line between collecting and hoarding,” Alexis says of her own curated edit, which consists of about 60 pieces she truly loves and wears. Alexis is trying on a spring/summer 2008 drop-waist Marni dress (look #52) with which she’s chosen to part. Had she kept it, she would have hemmed it to a maxi length and styled it with sneakers—a reliable daytime look for “feeling confident and put together.” She emphasizes the importance of tailoring vintage, which “costs less than you think and ensures you’ll wear it a million times more than if you don’t.” “It’s what makes it yours,” she says. Her Elsa Peretti bottle pendant makes another cameo—a staple that makes her feel “protected and self-assured.”\n\nShop more silver pendants:\n\nSophie Buhai Matchbank silver onyx necklace $1,350 NET-A-PORTER Agmes large Wishbone suede and sterling silver necklace $490 NET-A-PORTER\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral Photos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral\n\nThe Tried-and-True LBD\n\nJust because it’s vintage doesn’t mean you shouldn’t or can’t wear it often. This 2002 Prada pleated jersey dress with leather details from the fall collection (look 39) is a great example of that: it’s a does-it-all midi that Alexis says she’s worn countless times to work, to weddings, and to meetings—and styled it in a multitude of ways, with sneakers or heels, to suit the mood and occasion. Playing with proportion and materiality, she grounds the dress here with a Glenn Martens for Y/Project oversized denim jacket, then creates tension and interest with green satin pumps from Prada. The result? A day-to-night ensemble that’s elevated but still rooted in her comfort-first mindset.\n\nShop more black midis:\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Alexandra Cabral\n\nDressed Up Denim\n\nDenim doesn’t usually play a starring role in Alexis’s wardrobe, but for Phoebe, she’ll make an exception. Here, she pairs a dark wash style with an open-back silk top, also from the brand, her Elsa Peretti bean tassel necklace (of which she has interchangeable beans), and heeled loafers for a casual-chic lunch look with a fashion-forward twist. “I try not to wear light colors [or silks] when I’m doing inventory. People have open pens—I’ll lift a jacket and, before I know it, be covered in ink.” Alexis says she usually carries the same purse every day, so when she’s being extra intentional about her handbag choice, she’ll reach for her Phoebe Philo Cadillac bag in a bold burgundy.\n\nShop more black jeans:",

Styled by Sam Woolf, Doechii opted for a look from John Galliano’s spring 2024 ready-to-wear collection for Maison Margiela.\n\nDoechii at the 2025 GLAAD Media Awards. Dave Tolley/Getty Images\n\nDoechii wore a laminated nude plastic corset top complete with asymmetrical shoulders and a peplum, which she paired with the black deconstructed midi skirt from the runway, along with black and white Oxford Tabi heels. Both the top and skirt were embellished with haphazard stitching, the skirt’s in a contrasting white.\n\nThe musician of the moment took a Phantom Thread-esque approach to her styling, draping a measuring tape around her neck like a naughties skinny scarf and wearing a pincushion on her wrist as though it was a corsage. She also added a pair of her go-to frameless rectangular glasses.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey, Vogue, it's Gabrielle Union\n\nand I'm gonna walk you through my everyday skincare routine\n\nand my fresh day's makeup look.\n\nFirst step, kick out the retainer.\n\n[retainer clicks]\n\nWhen you don't wear it regularly,\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\ndon't tell my orthodontist.\n\nMe and my husband both have retainers.\n\nAnd every night, just like the scene in Bring It On,\n\nwe pop our retainers in and we pop ours out.\n\nThis is the U Beauty, it's the U Beauty,\n\nit's the U Beauty cleanser, which I love.\n\nAnd just in case, y'all thought I came in here\n\nwith some kind of little makeup situation on, I did not.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nUh-oh, see,\n\nhomegirl didn't get all the makeup off last night.\n\nThis is Witch Hazel, which I use as my toner.\n\nI was very lucky,\n\n'cause I never really had crazy problem skin,\n\nnot until my hormones changed.\n\nAnd then, it was like, Is this acne?\n\nHow do you get acne as a fully grown-ass woman?\n\nBut I found a way.\n\nAnd I had to just start experimenting\n\nand so, I think I'm probably like you guys.\n\nYou try a bunch of different things,\n\nyou see what fits, what doesn't fit.\n\nMy next step is my PCA Skin pore refining exfoliator.\n\nWhen I lived in Miami,\n\nI was, ooh, I was like an oil slick like,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nbut in California where it's dry heat,\n\nI've also gotten a little dry in my older age.\n\nSo, I have to switch up my routine based on where I'm at.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf you see someone's skin that you like,\n\nwhat are you doing,\n\nlike tell me the products, tell me the routine.\n\nYeah and I hope that it works for you.\n\nAnd if it doesn't, it's like dating.\n\nYou just keep trying.\n\nMy aunt once said, she said it much more crass than this,\n\nBut men or women are like Kleenex.\n\nYou try one, you use it.\n\nOh look, another one's popped up in its place.\n\nJust keep trying.\n\nNext up is 111SKIN.\n\nThis is their retinol oil.\n\nI'm gonna do it like the TikTokers.\n\nThis is probably the cringe stuff\n\nthat my daughter Zaya is talking about.\n\nTrying to do like a little skin influencer thing.\n\nGet ready with me.\n\nSo, some people have very strong opinions\n\nabout retinol in the daytime, mainly because of the sun.\n\nFor me, it's kind of interchangeable,\n\nbecause I'm psycho about protection from the sun.\n\nThe Therabody face thing.\n\nAnd this is how you know it's mine,\n\nbecause that, something spilled in my luggage.\n\nAnd you can use the cold function,\n\nor you can use the heat function.\n\nI'm using cold because mama didn't sleep.\n\nAnd it stays cold.\n\nI used to just use like a little bowl of ice in the morning.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThe thing about ice is it melts.\n\nIt doesn't stay as cold as I would like.\n\nAnd in this case, yes, I am going inside to outside,\n\nbecause I'm trying to push that inflammation,\n\nthat swelling right on out.\n\nSo, I am a device sucker!\n\nI love a device.\n\nSo, sometimes, you gotta go to the Shani Darden.\n\nThis is when I need backup.\n\nMy whole face is vibrating.\n\nI met Shani when I was doing a little show,\n\ncalled L.A.'s Finest\n\nwith one of her best friends, Jessica Alba,\n\nJessica swears by Shani.\n\nAnd so, Shani's a homegirl now.\n\nIf I had a hero product, it's the resurfacing compound.\n\nI started using U Beauty in September,\n\nabout this much I use,\n\nI've never gotten more compliments on my face.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWell, I wish I was the one who got my husband into skincare.\n\nWe have the same amazing facialists.\n\nThe more he started doing work on TV\n\nand retired from the NBA,\n\nhe was like, Oh, I need to get into a routine.\n\nAnd he moved this beautiful chair\n\nthat was in our living room into his bathroom.\n\nBecause he really likes\n\nto luxuriate during his skincare routine.\n\nIt's quite cute.\n\nThis is the vitamin B brightening serum.\n\nUse exactly what the directions say,\n\nbecause I have a problem with that.\n\nIf it says like a dime size, girl,\n\nI'm going for a half a dollar.\n\nAnd with all the things I've used thus far,\n\nyou have to commit to sunscreen.\n\nBecause these products left without any protection\n\nfrom the sun will work against you.\n\nWe have the U Beauty, the return.\n\nThis right here helps to bring these girls back.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nKaavia is obsessed with beauty, all things beauty.\n\nShe is the girliest girl ever.\n\nAnd she loves more makeup.\n\nShe's not really into like the skincare part of it.\n\nBut makeup?\n\nChild, she could do a beat.\n\nShe does eyes better than me.\n\nBut Zaya definitely has a skincare routine.\n\nI mean, but she's also,\n\nwhen you're walking the runways of Miu Miu,\n\nshe's gotten very much into skincare\n\nand the whole like having her own beauty routine.\n\nI don't know who else out there has a problem\n\nwith TikTok Shop.\n\nI can't stop myself.\n\nThe Babe Lash lash serum,\n\nthe new organic lash serum.\n\nAnd I use one on one eye and the other on this one.\n\nAnd I just wanna see which one is better.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSunscreen, I go 50 and it's Invisible Sunscreen Gel\n\nand it just disappears right into my face.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think black people needed to,\n\nI didn't think we needed to wear sunscreen.\n\nAnd that was a lie!\n\nBecause I used to think,\n\nOh my God!\n\nLook at all these freckles and moles.\n\nThey are so cute.\n\nAnd then, they started changing shape\n\nand I had to get them removed.\n\nMy girl Winnie Harlow came up\n\nwith this line called Cay Skin.\n\nThis is her lip balm, which I'm obsessed with.\n\nChocolate for the chocolate girls.\n\nBut I also discovered probably around 40\n\nwhen I was going through a lot of hormonal issues\n\nthat if I give up gluten, dairy, alcohol and caffeine,\n\nI was getting rid of a lot of inflammation\n\nand a lot of those perimenopausal challenges,\n\nhormonal challenges kind of disappeared the more I worked\n\non eliminating inflammation.\n\nSo, I'm just doing tinted moisturizer.\n\nToday, we're gonna go with the Laura Mercier slanted brush.\n\nI'm just gonna load her up like that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe beautiful thing\n\nabout more people getting into the beauty business,\n\nis that there's so many more options\n\nand there's so many more FUBU options, For Us, By Us.\n\nThere was a time though where I'd go to work\n\nand they wouldn't have the shade, child\n\nand I would look gray.\n\nSo, you start bringing your own makeup,\n\nyou start buying your own makeup.\n\nSo, now, you're paying for things\n\nthat you shouldn't have to pay for.\n\nAnd it's completely unfair and it still happens.\n\nAnd there was a time\n\nwhere there were only a few brown girls.\n\nThey're like, Be lucky girl!\n\nAnd I'm like, I don't wanna be the only one.\n\nI want there to be the range of black beauty.\n\nI want you to see the diaspora\n\non screen, behind the screens,\n\nin front of the camera, behind the camera.\n\nBut it's a fight, it's still a fight.\n\nConcealer next.\n\nI use Makeup by Mario, my honey Mario.\n\nI feel like I'm just gonna go with the darker one.\n\nAnd this is number 440.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think, the first time I got my makeup done professionally,\n\nI had been discovered at Trudys dress shop.\n\nTrudys was known as the prom dress capital of the world.\n\nThis lady comes up and she's like,\n\nWould you ever consider being\n\nin our prom dress commercial?\n\nAnd so, when I was getting my makeup done,\n\nit was the same products\n\nthat you could get at any drugstore,\n\nbut it was the touch, it was the feeling like a star\n\nthat I really loved, I really did love it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\nwhen I started going to the teen clubs.\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\nAnd I was like, I want a boyfriend.\n\nI don't know if you guys are familiar with Danessa Myricks\n\nand this is magic.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSee, it's giving me a little yellow,\n\nso, maybe, I will go back over it with a little Mario.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo, my next thing is CHANEL.\n\nIt's a little blush.\n\nSo, sometimes, when you've pulled an all-nighter,\n\nyour eyes might not be as white as you'd like.\n\nAnd these LUMIFY, first of all,\n\nyou can see this is my real stuff,\n\nbecause there's not even a label.\n\nAnd it's just,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\ntake a breath.\n\n[Gabrielle breathes out]\n\nI wasn't meditating, you guys.\n\nI was just thinking about fun songs that I like.\n\nI personally only love songs if they came out before 1995.\n\nAnd that's mainly because I know the lyrics.\n\nSo, this morning, it was Dionne Warwick.\n\n♪ Do you know the way to San Jose ♪\n\n[Gabrielle mouths music]\n\nThis is the CHANEL like for a little extra,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nyou know?\n\nCenter nose, what?\n\nSo, during the filming of Riff Raff,\n\nstarring the legend Jennifer Coolidge,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI play Sandy, she is Ed Harris' second wife\n\nand I was a second wife myself,\n\nis a little art imitating life.\n\nAnd this is my Mario, my Makeup by Mario liner.\n\nSo, she had like a really,\n\nit was pretty like a very nice, neutral,\n\nkind of like this, but with swollen eyes, you'll see it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMy girl RiRi!\n\nAnd this is a Fenty classic\n\nand I literally have 51100 of these\n\nin every purse, every drawer.\n\nKaavia has taken several.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sounds]\n\nThey're glossy, they're luscious.\n\nI still want more lip glosses.\n\nSo, I'm not gonna be the friend that's like,\n\nRi, where's the album?\n\nI'm not asking, 'cause I'm like, More please.\n\nSo, this is Damone Roberts, the brow pencil.\n\nLuckily, Damone just did my eyebrows.\n\nSo, I don't really have to do much.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI had a thin brow, y'all.\n\nAnd I thought it like made me more,\n\nI don't know, sophisticated,\n\nbut it just made me look mean.\n\nI'm not really mean.\n\nI played a lot of mean girls, which is fun.\n\nBut I'm so my mother's child from Nebraska.\n\nI'm still trying to give my neighbors May Day gifts.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's just a Midwest thing.\n\nI have been anxious since I was 19.\n\nAnd at 19, I was sexually assaulted,\n\na story I've talked about many, many times.\n\nBut after that, I got PTSD.\n\nAnd a part of that is I just have extreme anxiety\n\nabout everything,\n\nwhich I have been working on for the last 25-plus years\n\nwith the same therapist with varying degrees of success.\n\nAs I've gotten older, it's gotten a little better.\n\nIt's a lifetime thing.\n\nAnd this is my Victoria Beckham.\n\nWhen I get really, really anxious,\n\nI talk to myself and I say,\n\nWhat's the worst that can happen?\n\nWhat is the absolute worst thing that can happen right now?\n\nIt's not gonna happen, you're okay.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, it's the 10 deep breaths.\n\nDo they make me a little lightheaded?\n\nYes, they do, but the anxiety slowly dissipates.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm one of these people\n\nthat this feels like a surgical tool.\n\nWhen people come in, right, with, they come in like this,\n\nI definitely feel like you're gonna get my whole lash\n\nand people have.\n\nAgain, look at the mouth open.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHourglass, baby!\n\nIt's translucent tan.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMm-hmm [affirmative].\n\nAlso, I think I bought 57 of these,\n\n5711 of these from Costco.\n\nSecond to the last, Sakura.\n\nIt's so light, but like hmm,\n\nthat's a ranch [indistinct], like it's so good.\n\nThe last thing and this is my favorite,\n\nwell, one of my favorite products from my line,\n\nit's the Styling Glaze\n\nwhere I could have just done with my finger, but.\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\nI hope you learned a little something more about me,\n\nthe products that I use.\n\nAnd I hope you have a great day.\n\nI will.",

        "content": "As someone who is practically the poster child for “but first, coffee,” my teeth are constantly in need of a little brightening, and using the best whitening toothpaste (plus a great electric toothbrush) is one way I fight stains daily.\n\nIt’s completely normal for teeth to get discolored, especially if you’re a lover of coffee, red wine, or even tea. But rather than relying on costly (and even harsh) in-office treatments, incorporating a whitening toothpaste into your routine can be a gentler alternative. According to cosmetic dentist Dr. Lauren Becker, whitening toothpaste works by removing surface stains with abrasive particles that target those stubborn extrinsic stains.\n\nBelow, we asked Dr. Becker, along with other board-certified dentists, what to look for in a whitening toothpaste, how they compare to whitening strips, how long they take to work, and rounded up seven of our favorites on the market.\n\nVogue’s Favorite Whitening Toothpastes:\n\nIn This Story:\n\nBest Overall: Crest 3D White Advanced Whitening Toothpaste\n\nCrest 3D White Advanced Teeth Whitening Toothpaste $15 $12 AMAZON\n\nWhy We Love It: You may have grown up with Crest, but the brand continues to innovate year after year.

It also contains safe levels of fluoride, which prevents cavities by strengthening enamel, resisting acid attacks, and promoting remineralization, helping maintain strong, healthy teeth.” Dr. Becker agrees, adding, “My patients mention they’ve seen a noticeable difference after just a few days.”\n\nYou may have grown up with Crest, but the brand continues to innovate year after year.

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "When Scarlett White thinks back on her early childhood, there’s one memory in particular she returns to time and time again.\n\n“I remember my mom had a walk-in wardrobe with pink carpets,” White recalls over Zoom, a backdrop of dorm room bookshelves illuminated by the glow of her laptop screen. “She had these fantastic slip dresses that I remember trying on as a little girl, and shelves of shoes that I would fawn over. I always wanted to wear what she wore.”\n\nOf course, this wasn’t just any mom: White is referring to supermodel Karen Elson, the “red flame” from Oldham, who now has three decades at the top of the fashion industry under her belt. And this wasn’t just any closet. Packed to the rafters with rare vintage finds, couture pieces, and runway looks gifted to Elson by some of the world’s most celebrated designers, it was a treasure trove of fashion history.\n\n“Because I’m so deep in the fashion industry, I never wanted to force my style upon Scarlett—or force fashion upon her at all, really,” Elson says, joining the call from her home in Nashville. (That said, she admits that she does remember a phase of dressing White in 1940s-inspired peacoats as a toddler. That ended after Elson took her to the set of a Steven Meisel shoot and the photographer mistook her daughter for a vintage doll.)\n\nTo this day, the lure of her mom’s closet often proves too strong for White to resist—and as a result, she’s been “exposed to some very nice things,” Elson says, in something of an understatement. “When she became a teenager, I’d head up into Scarlett’s bedroom and go, ‘Oh that’s where the Galliano dress has gone. That’s where the Jean Paul Gaultier top went.’” Elson smiles. “It was really sweet to see her start to play around with fashion though, and find her own style.”\n\nDoes White still raid her mom’s closet? “Oh my God, yeah, all the time,” she says, a little bashfully, as Elson proceeds to call her out for wearing a Marc Jacobs cardigan on TikTok that had recently vanished from her own wardrobe. (“It looked good on you, though,” she admits.) Do White’s friends ever get jealous? “Not jealous, but they do ask to borrow [things] a lot,” White says. “Sometimes I let them, but sometimes it’s too special—I can’t just give out her archival runway clothing.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Protein seems to be on everyone’s mind right now, not because of new findings or weird social media debates but because the more we take our health seriously, the more we are actively looking for ways to ensure we get enough of one of the most vital nutrients out there. “Influencers and wellness advocates have shed light on how protein impacts hormone health, energy levels, and recovery, sparking curiosity among a broader audience,” says registered dietitian nutritionist Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN. “It is a very buzzy macro.”\n\nMade of amino acids, protein is needed for repairing and building muscle, weight loss, immune support, hormone regulation, and other bodily functions. You can find it in animal sources, such as beef, chicken, fish, dairy, and eggs. It’s also in a lot of plant sources, like beans, legumes, and nuts. But for times when your diet might not be enough to get the sufficient amount of protein you need, that’s where liquid protein—in the form of shakes, protein powders, and more—comes in.\n\n“Finding the time to plan and consume that much protein can be difficult,” says Samantha Dieras, RN, DCN, director of Ambulatory Nutrition Services at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Companies are creating products and people are developing recipes to help consumers more easily consume the amount of protein they desire.” So if you’re looking to supplement your protein intake with these liquid options, consider the following:\n\nFigure Out Your Health Goals\n\nThere are a lot of liquid protein options for you to choose from. The right one for you, says Manaker, is the one that best suits your personal health goals. “Looking to build muscle, manage weight, or simply ensure [you’re] meeting daily protein needs? This will help determine how much [you] need and in which form,” says Manaker.\n\nYou’ll also want to evaluate your overall diet and lifestyle. Manaker goes on to explain that if you’re already consuming a protein-rich diet, you probably won’t need much extra (or any) supplementation. Someone who struggles to meet the right protein requirements can look to these options as a convenient solution.\n\nNot All Liquid Proteins Are the Same\n\nManaker says that the results you get from a liquid protein can vary depending on the source of the protein and how much you consume. “Different sources [of protein], such as whey, plant-based, or collagen proteins, offer varying levels of essential amino acids and nutrients, which can influence how effective they are in meeting individual goals,” she explains. “The quantity of protein consumed should be tailored to one’s specific dietary needs and activity levels [for best] results.”\n\nLiquid Collagen Works When Used Properly\n\nWill drinking collagen actually do anything for your skin? Dieras says yes, collagen is often taken as a beauty supplement with studies showing that it can keep skin firm and supple while also adding hydration. Adding this to a balanced diet, a regimented skincare routine, and overall healthy lifestyle can do wonders for your skin overall.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, it's Simone Ashley\n\nand I'm gonna be showing you a little bit of my skincare\n\nand a very simple date night look.\n\nSo I'm just gonna clip my hair away.\n\nI like to use my La Mer cleansing gel.\n\nAs you can see, it's nearly finished.\n\nThat's because I love it so much\n\nand I used just a teeny tiny amount.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI never grew up doing much of a skincare routine.\n\nI always took care of my skin,\n\nbut everything I do, I really like to do it simply.\n\nOtherwise I feel like I'm like overloading my face\n\nand my skin with products.\n\nI had my first skin facial, like back in 2021\n\nand then I was, you know, transitioned to the dark side ll\n\nand I realized how great it is to take care of your skin.\n\nI was very naive and I thought\n\nbecause I have dark skin, I didn't need to use sunscreen,\n\nwhich I think a lot of women with dark skin might feel.\n\nDark skin needs some protection\n\njust as much as any other skin.\n\nI love to use an exfoliator on my face.\n\nThis one is Goldfaden.\n\nI dunno why I say McFaden. [laughs]\n\nIt's pretty empty 'cause I clearly use it a lot.\n\nI try not to exfoliate too much,\n\nmaybe like twice a week or something.\n\nAnd then I mainly go in around my nose\n\nand then I'm gonna go on my lips.\n\nOne day she's dry, one day she's oily.\n\nMuch like my personality. [laughs]\n\nI use body lotion on my face before I put my makeup on\n\njust 'cause it doesn't roll.\n\nYou know when you use certain moisturizers\n\nand they react to your makeup and then it starts rolling.\n\nAnd I usually do my makeup when I'm in a rush,\n\nso I haven't got time for that.\n\nSo I love to use La Roche-Posay. [laughs]\n\nThere's no other way of saying it, La Roche-Posay.\n\nBut in Simone's world it's La Roshay Posay. [laughs]\n\nThen I just like to put that all over my face.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to use like hand lotion\n\nand now I've upgraded to slightly fancier body lotion.\n\nAnd then just to finish off, I'm gonna use a teeny tiny bit\n\nof sunscreen.\n\n[music continues]\n\nMy skin is prepped\n\nand ready to have some makeup on it.\n\nI kind of work backwards with my makeup.\n\nSo I'm actually gonna start with my lip gloss.\n\nI wanna see the vision\n\nas it's developing, if you know what I mean.\n\nSo I start with a little lip gloss.\n\nPlump Ambition [laughs] from L'Oreal.\n\nThat's my nickname. [laughs]\n\nLips are locked and getting loaded\n\n'cause we'll go back to them at the end.\n\nBut I can feel them like sizzling away\n\nand they're having a bit of a party.\n\nI am then gonna go in with my blush.\n\nI actually sometimes just use a little bit\n\nof the lipstick color that I'm gonna eventually use.\n\nI'm gonna go in with this Armani one.\n\nIt's called Lip Power.\n\nLittle bit, they can be friends.\n\nI actually realize I don't need to put as much on\n\nas I might think I do.\n\nYou know when you're in high school\n\nand you start experimenting\n\nand learning how to do your makeup,\n\nI always loved like a clumpy mascara and I still kind of do.\n\nSo my eyebrows are a little bit crazy.\n\nThey're kind of sparse.\n\nCan you see?\n\nThere's like little gaps in them, which is fine.\n\nI like to stain the skin just a little bit.\n\nAnd then I go in with another brow pencil and I fluff it up.\n\nMe and this eyebrow, we're not friends.\n\nThis one just, there we go.\n\nSo then I go in with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil\n\nin granite or dark brown.\n\n[music continues]\n\nEyebrows are now done.\n\nHappy with those.\n\nTea break.\n\nGirls with dark skin, color correcter changed my life.\n\nI had never really understood what it was\n\nuntil a few years ago.\n\nI get a lot of shadow around my mouth\n\nand color corrector just kind of balances out the shadow.\n\nI go in with my brush\n\nand then do a little bit here, a little bit there.\n\nI think when I was younger I was picking out color tones\n\nthat were maybe a lit a bit too light for me.\n\nAnd then I started just buying stuff, whatever worked\n\nfor me at work on set\n\nand I just stuck to that shade for a bit.\n\nAnd then maybe on another job I'd be like,\n\nOh, this one's actually better.\n\nI would just kind of follow what the pros are using.\n\nI've got a little friend over here, so we're just gonna\n\nask him to go away.\n\nMy first experience as an actor was for a kids show\n\nand they asked me if I was okay with my makeup\n\nand I was sat in the chair and they were like,\n\nOh, you happy with everything?\n\nAnd I was like, Me?\n\nLike, you're asking if I am okay with my makeup?\n\nAnd I wasn't used to, I just thought I was,\n\nI had to do what I was told.\n\nAnd they were like, No, it's your face.\n\nThen I really started watching\n\nhow people were doing my makeup\n\nand learn what I liked and what I didn't like.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of a tinted moisturizer.\n\nI like using this Urban Decay one in shade 70.\n\nNeeds some waking up.\n\nCome on, come on. [laughs]\n\nI've put a little bit, literally teeny tiny bit.\n\nThis is actually, I would say this is too much.\n\nI really don't like going out on a date\n\nor going out with my friends and the makeup\n\nlike over a few hours I start noticing it.\n\nI just wanna forget that I've even got makeup on my face.\n\nSo less is more for me.\n\n[music continues]\n\nAnd then this guy's really annoying me.\n\nMy forehead, I don't like,\n\nI don't put too much makeup on there,\n\n'cause that's where I'm prone to getting spots\n\nand unwanted visitors.\n\nI remember Sex Education kind of well,\n\nit feels like years ago.\n\nWe all auditioned for the same role\n\nand then they kind of workshopped characters around us.\n\nAnd that's when I suggested Olivia like had bubble gum\n\nand blue bubbles and stuff.\n\nAnd she wasn't really a mean girl,\n\nshe was just finding her way.\n\nAnd the more I rewatch watch the series, you realize\n\nthat she's just finding her identity still.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of concealer now.\n\nOh holy concealer.\n\nWhat would we do without you?\n\nFeeling tired?\n\nConcealer.\n\nGot a spot?\n\nConcealer.\n\nI use the shade Walnut.\n\nThis is my NARS concealer.\n\nJesse actually used this on me in Bridgerton\n\nand I never looked back.\n\n[music continues]\n\nBridgerton feels very transformative.\n\nI turn up at 5:00 AM in my pajamas\n\nand then hours later I step out looking like a viscountess,\n\nwhich is just amazing.\n\nI think the girls on Bridgerton really, we all go\n\nthrough such a transformation with the wigs and the makeup\n\nand the dresses.\n\nIt's such a dream.\n\nEvery season I fall in love with Kate's looks more and more.\n\nHer makeup looks are just so, they started off very plain.\n\nShe wasn't wearing much makeup.\n\nAnd then the softer she got, the more lashes were fluttering\n\nand the more color were on her cheeks.\n\nAnd a little bit of lip stick, lip color.\n\nI learnt so much from the makeup department on Bridgerton\n\nand I wish I could say it was my real hair, but it's not.\n\nIt's a wig.\n\nI can't say anything about this season.\n\nI would say as the characters progress, their makeup,\n\ntheir hair, their costumes, all progress with them.\n\nI'm gonna attempt a little bit of eye makeup.\n\nI would happily step out like this, with a bit of mascara,\n\nbut I'm gonna make an effort.\n\nI've got this Rare Beauty bronzing stick.\n\nI'm gonna just get my ring finger\n\nand dab it on my eyelids a little bit like that.\n\nAnd just put it on the lid.\n\nWe're gonna bring it down to the lash line there.\n\nMy mom didn't wear too much makeup.\n\nShe always wore like kohl eyeliner, very Indian.\n\nI'm just gonna get this guy\n\nand I'm just gonna go on like my waterline.\n\nToday I'm in a rush,\n\nso I'm just gonna use a crayon eyeliner,\n\nthe same one I used to stain my eyebrows.\n\nI want to just go in a tiny, tiny bit.\n\nI might be a little bit too smoky.\n\nSo we're just gonna go in with my brush.\n\nAnd then it has a little, it has a jacket. [laughs]\n\nI'm really excited for this year.\n\nI've got some very cool things going on.\n\nOne being the first movie I've ever produced.\n\nPicture This, which is my rom-com.\n\nSo I'm very tired. [laughs]\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nI had lots of creative control,\n\nwhich was really important for me\n\nbecause I grew up watching Bridget Jones\n\nand all the classic studio rom-coms back in the nineties.\n\nAnd I always wanted to be that girl.\n\nI never really saw anyone that looked like me.\n\nSo I was like, you know what, if we're gonna do this,\n\nlet's try and do it right.\n\nSo I had creative say on the character quite a lot,\n\non Pia's character and her background, which was super fun.\n\nAnd I was just really grateful that I could have,\n\nyou know, that the team at 42mp trusted me with that.\n\nI'm gonna use my mascara, which is my L'Oreal Paradise.\n\nNot just Paradise.\n\nIt's Paradise Big Deal. [laughs]\n\nAnd then I also have the F1 movie coming out this year.\n\nIt's produced by Louis Hamilton.\n\nI would say that's one of the dream movies\n\nthat I've ever been part of.\n\nThat was an incredible experience.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with this guy.\n\n[music continues]\n\nWhen I have downtime, when I'm not filming or in the studio\n\nor doing press, I'll go to the banya, which is\n\nlike a sauna and do ice baths and sweat it all out.\n\nI have such a tight knit of girlfriends\n\nand friends in my community in London\n\nand I just hang out with them really.\n\nAnd time with my dog.\n\nMy dog!\n\nLook, I've got this little necklace that has her face on it.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with a little bit of lip gloss.\n\nSo let's take the hair down.\n\nLet's give it a bit of a zhuzh.\n\nI think it's very minimal.\n\nI didn't use too much products on my skin,\n\nso I feel like I'm gonna last all night.\n\nThis was so much fun\n\nand I hope it was helpful for anyone who wants\n\nto learn how to do their makeup\n\nor any girls with skin similar to mine.\n\nWe're gonna put on some Whitney Houston\n\nor some George Michael and dance around\n\nwith an espresso martini.\n\nBye Vogue, thank you. [laughs]\n\n[music continues]",

They are great.\n\nThey're all named off to the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich I heard Chappell Roan has chickens that are named\n\nafter the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich for me just feels like a segue\n\ninto a really close friendship.\n\nMy chickens, I had from babies, I raised them.\n\nI was actually told they were gonna die\n\nand then all of them survived.\n\nSo it's the power of love in Chappell Roan, I guess.\n\nChappell, if you're watching this,\n\nknow that our chickens could get along.\n\nPosh would like to meet Posh 2.0.\n\nOkay, I'm in a pretty good place\n\nwhere the onion is really diced.\n\nMy pepper, right down. Cut the head off.\n\nTake the inside. This is the part my chickens love the most.\n\nAlways save that part.\n\nI was full when I left Spain,\n\nso it's always been a part of my life.\n\nMy first memory ever,\n\nI had like a toy car that I would drive.\n\nIt was like a very small, you know, baby toy car.\n\nWe lived on a hill and in Spain, my dad can confirm\n\nor deny this, but I lost control\n\nand I was going down the hill and my dad was chasing\n\nafter me and like, I think that was my first memory.\n\nI was like a really clumsy kid.\n\nSo I would fall a lot, chip my teeth, slip my head open.\n\nYou know, it's all added to the creativity of\n\nwho I am today though,\n\nIt's all made me smarter.\n\nAt least that's what my mom tells me.\n\nSo I'm like actually getting shit done.\n\nWhereas usually I am on the phone\n\nwith my girlfriends dying laughing at some TikTok.\n\nAre we done with that? [sighs] Oh, my God, the chorizo.\n\nOkay, I hate, hate, hate cooking meat.\n\nLike it's my least favorite part of any cooking experience.\n\nAgain, leave that to my husband.\n\nBut here we are today,\n\nMillie has to overcome her fears.\n\nFYI, I don't usually do this,\n\nso I'm gonna cut that like that\n\nand then I'm just gonna open it like that.\n\nUgh, that feels right to me.\n\nNow it's just looking weird. Let's chop it up.\n\n[knife chops]\n\nActually the smell is so delicious.\n\nI do slice it 'cause I don't like...\n\nMy dad also is the same.\n\nWe don't like it to be too big\n\nand I usually just pile them on top just\n\nto make it go faster.\n\nSo we're now at a place where we have our diced veggies.\n\nWe have that, that thing.\n\nAnd we're going to use the stove now. Let's do it.\n\nLet's make magic happen. Voila.\n\nNow we have my stove.\n\nSo what I like to do is I like to start off\n\nby turning it on, medium heat, put some oil in.\n\nI will put my onions in, put my garlic in,\n\nand I'm gonna throw my saffron in the chicken stock\n\nto bloom it while I'm cooking.\n\nNow I'm going to add some salt.\n\nFor me, I loved baking in COVID\n\nand until I smell like it's walking,\n\nthen I kind of, that incentivizes me to keep going.\n\nIt starts to smell bad. That's when we put a roadblock.\n\nI'm very much just like go with the flow, just keep tasting\n\nas I go along and see if it needs more of anything.\n\nI'm gonna let this caramelized.\n\nAnytime anyone wants to kind of go out for dinner,\n\nI'm always like, Come over, and it feels more intimate.\n\nAnd it actually, I feel like my love for food is like a way\n\nof saying like, Thank you for coming over.\n\nSo now I'm just gonna throw in the red pepper.\n\nI'm gonna start with my least favorite part,\n\nwhich is cooking the meat.\n\nI have a very bad irrational fear\n\naround raw chicken and some might say,\n\nMillie, go be a vegetarian.\n\nAnd I'm gonna say to that, Yeah, I was a vegetarian\n\nfor a really long time, but I found out my body needs meat.\n\nEverybody's different.\n\nAnd that's what was happening with me.\n\nWe have olive oil, we have the chicken.\n\n[chicken sizzling]\n\nOnce it's cooked, I usually leave it in the bowl.\n\nI don't eat it. That's Jake always\n\nwhen we're like cleaning up after he goes,\n\nYou haven't even touched it.\n\nSo why do we put it in there?\n\nAnd I'm like, I know, I do this every time.\n\nBut it's for the enjoyment of my other guests.\n\nI want everybody else to enjoy the chicken,\n\nI just seemingly can't.\n\nWe're gonna add some salt and pepper.\n\nThis is my paprika.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in now to give some\n\nof the veggies some flavor.\n\nI mean, I was on Hell's Kitchen.\n\nYeah, that's right. I was the idiot sandwich.\n\nNo, I was a guest on there when I was like nine.\n\nI love Gordon. I love his whole family.\n\nOh, but Stanley Tucci's a good chef,\n\nbut I've never tried his food.\n\nSo invite me over, Stanley.\n\nAll right, something's happening.\n\nIt's definitely turning a different color.\n\nNext, we're going to add in that chorizo.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n[chorizo sizzling]\n\nI'm just gonna put in like not all of it.\n\nAnd I really like the chorizo really crispy.\n\nSo this is the part where I take the most time\n\nand make sure that it's like really crispy and delicious.\n\nNext, I'm gonna put in [giggles] my canned tomatoes.\n\nI'm just gonna pop this in.\n\nAnd this actually helps soften the vegetables.\n\nI just like to kind of mix this around, get it moving. Yum.\n\nJust wait, have faith in me. It's looking good.\n\nIt looks where it needs to be for me.\n\nIf you put it in the rice fast,\n\nit picks up all the flavors of the oils.\n\n[eye tinkles]\n\nWoo-hoo.\n\nI'm just gonna mix this together\n\nand I'm gonna add in chicken stock.\n\nSo I again like to do this kind of the same thing\n\nwith the paprika but do it intermittently\n\nbecause the rice really soaks up fast.\n\nAnd then you have to keep trying\n\nand make sure the rice is actually cooking\n\nand then you add more.\n\nI kind of play it by ear at this point.\n\nAnd you let the rice do the talking.\n\nNow I'm gonna put in the peas,\n\nI'm gonna put in the blooming saffron\n\nand I'm gonna put in the rest of my paprika.\n\nChef's kiss.\n\nLid is gonna go on top of this while this is cooking.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep looking at this in disappointment.\n\nThe wedding food process, I didn't do a tasting,\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\nOur caterer was Galateo, the most like renowned,\n\nbeautiful catering company in, honestly Europe.\n\nSo I was like, You got this.\n\nAnd to this day, guests at my wedding say,\n\nThere was a pasta dish that was like so amazing.\n\nWhat I really wanted the takeaway to be was\n\nthat the food was the best food\n\nthey've ever had at a wedding.\n\nAnd I am taking, taking that very proudly.\n\nI very much am not a trad wife, but I do love cooking\n\nand I love married life.\n\nI love cooking with my husband. Jake also loves the farm.\n\nHe also loves cooking like we're a trad couple,\n\nbut like a trendy trendy trad couple.\n\nSo now I'm going to pop the chicken in to the paella.\n\nProbably needs another like, honestly 15 minutes,\n\nbut we'll check like intermittently.\n\nSo what I would usually do at home is I would then go\n\nand let the dogs out, put my life jacket\n\non my English bulldog 'cause she really likes the pool,\n\nbut she doesn't realize that she can't swim.\n\nAll right, I'm gonna make you a drink. Let's do it.\n\nSo now I'm gonna show you my favorite drink,\n\nwhich is a Shirley Temple.\n\nI grew up in the industry always going to like fancy dinners\n\nand meeting fancy people.\n\nAnd to feel fancy myself, I would order a Shirley Temple.\n\nAnd now growing up and being 21,\n\nmy preference is always gonna be a Shirley Temple.\n\nI need a cold drink.\n\nLet's find like a really nice one to sit on top of that.\n\nYeah, that's what we wanna see.\n\nOkay, then I'm gonna do a splash.\n\nI like to do a squeeze of lime\n\nand then I like to fill it all the way up.\n\nOkay, I like to pop that in there.\n\nOne for me, one for the drink,\n\nand then I'm gonna use the back\n\nof a spoon just to get that grenadine.\n\nDoesn't that look so good? And guess what this doesn't do.\n\nLeave you questioning everything you did the night before.\n\nAlways choose Shirley. This is like the best drink ever.\n\nSo I'm very happy with this. Let's check the paella.\n\n[food sizzling]\n\nOh my gosh, it looks amazing.\n\nI'm gonna do a little taste test\n\nwith the same Shirley Temple spoon, just gonna...\n\nMy dad would like it, however, Jake wouldn't.\n\nSo I'm gonna pour some more of this on\n\nbecause the rice is still too hard.\n\nAnd then I'm just going to bring all\n\nof the sides into the middle.\n\nThis might be my segue into my cooking career.\n\nWe don't know, like I could be the next Stanley Tucci.\n\nWe're gonna let that do its thing again.\n\nAnd it's also gonna get crispy on the bottom,\n\nwhich is my favorite part of any paella.\n\nTas tas.\n\n[bell dings] Checking.\n\nThat's ready. All right, this is ready to be served.\n\nSo I'm gonna tidy up so we can get taste testing.\n\nAll right, we're back. I clearly had way too much fun.\n\nI'm gonna make another.\n\nThis time, I'm gonna put two cherries in.\n\nThe rest is Sprite.\n\nThe reveal. Here we go.\n\nThis is our paella. I'm gonna start in the middle.\n\nWhy not?\n\nNow I'm going to put a little bit of parsley.\n\nNot one flake went on there.\n\nA little lemon and voila, that is my paella.\n\nWow. I'm getting hints of saffron.\n\nI'm getting hints of tomato. This is delicious.\n\nGood job me.\n\nIt's all working. It's all giving.\n\nIt's all serving.\n\nMy kitchen at home does not look like this.\n\nAnd it usually has around 10 dogs running around me,\n\neating everything that falls on the ground.\n\nIt's just been a really peaceful, enjoyable experience.\n\nI love limes. You know, and Dakota's like, I love limes.\n\nI would like to take this home in memory\n\nof that amazing video.\n\nThanks so much for watching. Bye.\n\nI have a nephew and I perform popular to him.\n\nHe fully giggles and laughs\n\nat me playing Elphaba and Glinda for him.\n\nHe loves the power of Elphaba.\n\nLike he can really...\n\nHe feels it, but Glinda makes him laugh.\n\n[upbeat bright music]",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Justin Vivian Bond and Erdem Moralioglu have known each other for quite some time—he first met her backstage after one of her shows at Le Poisson Rouge in New York, and they reconnected in London when Bond performed with Anthony Roth Costanzo at Wilton’s Music Hall. Yet the idea they’d collaborate came from Rao, who, in his other day job, serves as a commercial special projects consultant for the Erdem brand. “There’s a subtle theatricality to much of Erdem’s work that lends itself to the charismatic glamour Vivian conveys—not only on stage, but in her everyday life,” Rao said of the pairing. “Erdem and Vivian share an innate love of storytelling, whether it be through craft or song, and know how to expertly nod to history without being nostalgic.”\n\nWhile she may not indulge in nostalgia, the past has been a fruitful source of inspiration for Bond—both in her mining of the torch singer-glamour Rao referenced (Bond’s look, often coiffed and soignee, has nodded to the likes of Julie London) and in her choice of songs, which have wrought, through joy, anger, hope, and defiance, a vocalizing of queer experience, literally and metaphorically. When I first saw Bond perform about fifteen years ago, she covered everything from queer poet Essex Hemphill’s “American Wedding” to “The Golden Age of Hustlers,” an ode to San Francisco’s Castro as if sung by Joan Baez.\n\nFor her show at Cooper Union, Bond’s choice of material will be equally electric and eclectic, ranging from “Kid Fears” by the Indigo Girls to Electronic’s “Getting Away With It.” For some of those songs, she will be joined by the New York City Gay Men’s Chorus—they performed together one holiday season. For Bond, that was an incredible experience. “It was such a thrill,” she said, “because I love singing. It’s my favorite thing to do—that’s why I’m a singer. But also,” she added, with feeling, “singing is healing.”",

        "content": "Few foods are as high in protein as eggs. Whether scrambled, fried, poached, or hard-boiled, they’re also high in vitamin D, antioxidants, and minerals. It’s no wonder that many nutrition experts consider them a near-perfect food. “Studies show that those who include eggs in their breakfast feel less hungry during the day and are more successful at maintaining their weight,” explains sports nutritionist Sascha Barboza of Sascha Fitness.\n\nIt’s also no wonder, then, that eggs are often the central component for many breakfast dishes across the globe. Think: huevos rancheros, shakshuka, frittata, tamagoyaki, and more. It seems that almost no cuisine would be the same without this singular ingredient. Despite ever-changing food trends, the egg remains undefeated.\n\nEggs help avoid glucose spikes\n\nWe’ve all been in the situation where we’ve started the day with a sweet and gooey breakfast only to be left hungry soon after and for the rest of the day. Eggs have the opposite effect: Not only do they help you stay satiated for hours, but they help you avoid those awful glucose spikes. According to biochemist Jessie Inchauspé—also known as Glucose Goddess— this is an ideal combo when it comes to breakfast food: “A savory breakfast is essentially a breakfast that doesn’t have sugar or starch as a main ingredient,” she explains. “Savory breakfasts can be very versatile, ranging from classic combinations like eggs and bacon to something more sophisticated like avocado toast.”\n\nNot to mention: Getting the recommended amount of protein each day is essential for muscle mass gain, tissue repair, and hormonal balance—so why not start with breakfast? Here, Barboza shares a recipe for one of her favorite high-protein, egg-centric breakfasts to help you do just that.\n\nMushroom and leek omelette\n\n1 cup sliced mushrooms\n\n1 chopped leek stalk\n\n1 egg + 3 egg whites\n\nOil spray\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nPreparation",

        "title": "Simone Rocha Fall 2025 Menswear Collection",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "When Simone Rocha first introduced menswear in 2023, it was partly for the fun of it. As the kind of designer whose world-building is already so complete (even if you’ve followed Rocha’s career only glancingly, you can likely reel off a list of her design signatures), the opportunity to develop an entirely new facet of the brand came as a welcome challenge. But it was also just to meet demand. Male friends and customers had already been snapping up womenswear pieces (the bomber jackets and bejeweled Aran knits were proving to be particular hits), and after seeing the overwhelming response to the menswear from her H&M collaboration, Rocha decided she simply had to give the people what they wanted. “Seeing people wear it in real life, I knew it could become its own story—or at least a second character to sit alongside the women’s,” Rocha says.\n\nThe challenge as a designer was to give the people something they didn’t already know they wanted; luckily, that’s a challenge she’s adept at confronting. Rocha has a remarkable ability to take the prettiness and traditional femininity of her design signatures and turn the dial towards something darker and more perverse, but still desirable. So it’s been fascinating to watch her use menswear to explore the inverse: to take the building blocks of a utilitarian, traditionally masculine wardrobe—bombers, parkas, cargo pants, boxy tailoring—and inject a dose of undiluted Rocha romance, recasting them in taffeta and tinsel or sprinkling them with crystals and ribbons.\n\nAll of this is to say, it comes as little surprise to learn that two years after launching, Rocha has decided it’s time to spin her menswear off to become its own thing. While a handful of menswear looks appeared in her Aesop’s Fables-inspired fall 2025 runway show last month, she’s now releasing her full offering as a separate lookbook. In part, because the collection was so “character-driven,” Rocha explains. “We really felt the build-up of all these archetypes while we were making the collection, and at a certain point, I just thought, actually, this should be its own body of work.”\n\nAcross 30 looks, those archetypes are laid out with precision—“each look is its own little island, which I quite liked,” she said—and serve as a kind of taxonomy of Rocha’s menswear universe. There’s the fierce romantic in a rugby shirt trimmed with frills, clutching a bunch of roses, with one of Rocha’s new padlock belts—a cheeky wink to school kids kissing behind the bike sheds—around his waist. (The lurid green over-dyed wash denim, meanwhile, was an effect created to resemble grass stains—presumably a nod to the sartorial aftermath of all that frolicking.) There’s the more sensitive, scholarly type, leafing through a book in a diaphanous trench coat spliced together featuring panels of broderie anglaise and striped shirting fabric, billowing knee-length shorts just visible underneath. Then there’s the local bad boy, in a killer denim jacket with embroidery on the pockets, his ripped jeans featuring a string of pearls slung over the hip like a biker’s chain.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "For a very specific demographic, nothing signals spring like breaking out the boat shoes, khaki shorts, and a pale pink Vineyard Vines polos—with a popped collar, of course.\n\nThanks to his latest outfit, Harry Styles can now count himself in sartorial community with East Coast preps, Southern fraternity boys, and Oxford university rowing elites alike. The singer was spotted in London on March 28 wearing a cotton candy colored polo shirt, its collar upturned around his neck. But make no mistake: Styles isn’t about to go hit the putting green or charter a yacht off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. Instead, he is modeling a new way forward, showing mullet-sporting, mustachioed fashion boys just how to wear the frat star staple.\n\nStyles paired his preppy shirt with a cerulean chore coat, pinstriped trousers, and a pair of well-worn Vans that we can assume were once white. (Styles, who wore the classic sneakers to sit front row at London Fashion Week, is a well-documented fan of the shoe brand.) Of course, no look is complete without his beloved black, sepia-tinted Jacques Marie Mage aviator sunglasses.\n\nAn investor in Steven Stokey-Daley’s label S.S. Daley, perhaps Styles is simply mirroring the exaggerated, flipped collars that the designer sent down the runway back in February with fall 2025 collection. Or maybe he’s taking cues from Stokey-Daley himself. And really, Harry Styles is existing in the same trendsphere and whipping around the same pop culture weathervane as the rest of us, with L.L Bean totes and Ralph Lauren blazers and the J. Crew catalog blowing in the breeze. More practically: As the weather gets warmer, an upturned collar offers a simple bit of sun protection or a channel for some cool air. Whatever’s going on behind this styling trick, if anyone can kickstart a popped collar revival, it’s Harry Styles.",

        "content": "As the only child of an American mother and British father, I grew up in New York but spent every June and July in London with my parents, who led a hectic social life and largely left me to my own devices. I had one friend from home, Susie Cooke, who was in a similar situation, so we hung out together, mostly unsupervised. Since life at our respective New England boarding schools was heavily rule-bound, we looked forward to London all year.\n\nThen, in 1963, The Beatles burst onto the airwaves. The way I saw the world changed completely. During three successive London summers, Susie and I witnessed Vidal Sassoon haircuts, Mary Quant makeup, wildly abbreviated skirts, and cool trouser suits gradually becoming de rigueur for most women under 40.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, when I was 17, I landed a job as a reader at a publishing house while renting a room from an uber-respectable landlady in Park Walk, Chelsea. To her patent disapproval, every morning before work, I applied pale foundation, painted eyelashes onto my bottom lids, and donned my shortest skirt. No one could have accused me of exercising too much diligence when it came to my job. I lived for my paycheck of $17 every Friday and the weekly pilgrimage to Biba, where an entire outfit could be bought for about $10. However, on the bus heading down the King’s Road, I soon noticed that the coolest kids on the street had more or less ditched the mod aesthetic and were turned out in flowing attire recalling a more romantic age. I was instantly galvanized.\n\nIt wasn’t long before I tracked down the source of this new look–the Chelsea Antique Market–situated in a huge rabbit warren of a building not far from my place. Inside, there were a maze of stalls selling an array of antique jewelry, books and maps, Turkish carpets, and art nouveau lamps. On the ground floor, a men’s vintage clothes stall was stuffed with ruffled shirts, pre-1920s military jackets, and velvet bell-bottoms. Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones were poster boys for this look–soon, it was everywhere.\n\nOn the second-floor landing, a dimly lit grotto with a dizzying display of vintage clothes suspended four or five layers deep from ceiling to floor became my favorite London haunt. Couture dresses in mint condition, from Schiaparelli and Poiret, hung alongside sequined tops à la Josephine Baker, exquisitely beaded boleros, and delicate chiffon dresses from the 1930s. On the brightly painted shelves were piles of Fair Isle jumpers and cut-velvet shawls. Everything was jumbled together to the point that it was almost impossible to distinguish one piece from another. There was no space for a fitting room, so if you wanted to try something on, you had to strip off in front of whoever happened to be there.",

Sure, you may think the differences between certain genres are so granular (though, as we’ve learned, the difference between bootcut and flare pants is enormous). But still, every type of pants has its place in the fashion ecosystem, from trendy low-slung trousers to the skinny jeans of yore.\n\nPants preferences are also deeply personal. Some people prefer to have something that clings to the body and gives them shape, while, for others, the baggier the better. Loyalty also runs deep in the high and low-waisted camps: Some pants-wearers will be wanted a defined waist while others may prefer the room to breathe.\n\nMaybe you’re looking to expand your pants repertoire, or perhaps you’re just curious about what’s out there. Worry not, the Vogue team has lots of opinions. Below, our editors make the case for their favorite types of pants, from ’70s-inspired flares to the controversial low-rise.\n\nTheStewartofNY\n\nFlares\n\nI love a high-rise flare. A real businesswoman of the 70s vibe is my favorite. A little length, a little grace around the ankle, a belly button button—what's not to love? —Chloe Malle, editor of vogue.com\n\nGod, I love a flare! I think part of this is my rebellious nature flare-ing up (haha?) because fat people are famously only supposed to wear those ugly dark navy straight-legged jeans they always put women in on What Not to Wear, but I love how a flared leg announces itself and makes it clear that I am absolutely not apologetic about being in whatever room I’m in. Also, I love looking like a chunky Penny Lane! —Emma Specter, culture writer",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, Vogue, it's Amanda Seyfried,\n\nand I'm gonna show you how I get ready,\n\nand I'm gonna do a pretty basic go-to makeup look.\n\nFirst step, drinking my celery juice.\n\nApparently that's what you do.\n\nYou might be thinking, what's that on her face?\n\nThat's my eczema, and I too suffer from perioral dermatitis.\n\nI'm gonna wash my face with something\n\nthat I've been using forever.\n\nNot only is it a great bar soap for your face,\n\nbut it's also a GD heart.\n\nWhen I was 19, I started developing the rash,\n\nand I learned about a lot of medicated products.\n\nI learned a lot about just products in general\n\nfrom my dermatologist at the time.\n\nAnd the rash is screaming, but that's okay,\n\nbecause I'm gonna cover it\n\nso I can go out in public. [laughs]\n\nIt's funny how eczema makes you feel.\n\nSo two years ago,\n\nI had another flare up and I cut out dairy.\n\nBoy, it was hard.\n\nBye-bye, cappuccinos, black coffee all the way.\n\nYou know, I can't wake up and not have coffee,\n\nso I also have coffee here.\n\nThis, don't worry.\n\nI'm using this medicated cream\n\nfor this little cutie mustache.\n\nNow I'm gonna use toner, Tonique Comfort, Confort.\n\nIt's French.\n\nI'll never be able to say it right.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in my hands.\n\nMy skin has gotten better over the years.\n\nI've noticed it is a little better after kids.\n\nI eat better than I ever have.\n\nI mean, the celery juice must be doing something, right?\n\nVersine Serum, Creme Serum.\n\nAnd all of this does go over the medicine,\n\nbecause the medicine penetrates first.\n\nI've just always really been into\n\nthis boosted contouring eye balm.\n\nI learned about how important specifically eye cream is\n\nfor under our eyes.\n\nIt's just such thin skin\n\nand you just gotta take care of your eyes,\n\nso even in the morning I use the eye cream.\n\nAnd then, of course, you cannot forget SPF,\n\nthe Lancome Renergie Peptide Cream.\n\nBut SPF is really important,\n\nand we know that now more than ever.\n\nThe neck is important too. Don't forget the neck.\n\nSkincare done.\n\nI'm gonna curl my lashes,\n\nbecause my eyelashes, I'll have you know, are straight.\n\nYeah, it's a bummer.\n\nI don't let other people do it\n\nbecause they sometimes pinch my eyelids.\n\nI'm also gonna put this lip balm on.\n\nThis one, it's giving youth.\n\nIt just gives a tint, and a hit of like, pink.\n\nIt gives a hint of health. [laughs]\n\nAt home, I don't use foundation,\n\nbecause I don't know how to properly apply it,\n\nand that's okay.\n\nWe don't need to.\n\nBut this, I can't live without, this Teint Idole concealer.\n\nI thought I had misplaced it the other day\n\nwhen I went to the airport,\n\nand I almost had a meltdown internally\n\nwhen I needed to cover this guy.\n\nI also have really red eyelids\n\nand you would think I'd wanna cover those up,\n\nbut it's like natural eyeshadow, so I'm gonna embrace it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\n'cause I realized over the years\n\nI know what works on my face and what doesn't,\n\nand I also am like pretty low maintenance\n\nand I don't like a lot of steps.\n\nSo I was just able to cultivate, like,\n\nthis routine over the years.\n\nYou see how easy that was?\n\nI don't need to get rid of all the redness.\n\nI wouldn't know how to even try.\n\nBut this is not a red carpet look,\n\nthis is me doing my makeup to look pretty and clean.\n\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is my eyebrows.\n\nHuh! Eyebrows. [laughs]\n\nWhat a concept.\n\nThey've changed over the years.\n\nYes, I too over-plucked, because I was born in '85,\n\nand it's taken decades to grow them back.\n\nSo Anastasia was one of the first places I went in LA\n\nin my twenties and that's where I learned about eyebrows.\n\nRight now I'm like really loving this because it's easy.\n\nI can just use the wand and they paint\n\nthe lighter colored wands and make it all more uniform,\n\nand that's what I'm looking for.\n\nAnd I'm looking for thickness,\n\nbecause they are growing back,\n\nand they're growing back well, but there's some holes.\n\nYou're just painting them.\n\nWhen I was on As the World Turns, which is a soap opera,\n\nI remember feeling embarrassed to go to set\n\nbecause I felt like I just wasn't used\n\nto seeing my face covered in so much foundation and powder\n\nthat I almost like, my face would crack a little bit,\n\nand as a 15-year-old, that's scary,\n\nbut I look back and I'm like, that's TV makeup.\n\nAnd I looked really cute.\n\nLike, I didn't look ugly,\n\nI just felt ugly because I was a teenager,\n\nand that's just, that's what we do.\n\nSo now I'm gonna put the Anastasia gel on\n\nto hold it in place, 'cause I don't know about you,\n\nbut when I leave the house\n\nand I like put a sweater on or sweatshirt,\n\nI always put it over my face and it messes with my brows.\n\nI'll put a little bit more of this on.\n\nGoing from the soap operas that I had done\n\nto Mean Girls happened so randomly and so fast\n\nthat I was just going with the flow\n\nand I was just happy to be working.\n\nI knew how lucky I was,\n\nbut we didn't quite know how big that movie was gonna be.\n\nAlthough that sounds really sad,\n\nit kinda helped prepare me for the rejection\n\nthat every actor has.\n\nThe thing that I never understood was blush\n\nand it took me until my mid-thirties to discover the blush.\n\nIt's the secret weapon.\n\nIt's incredible!\n\nLike, I don't have rosy cheeks, unless I'm freezing.\n\nMonika Blunder is another beautiful makeup artist\n\nthat I've been working with since I was, since Mamma Mia!\n\nI'm obsessed with this Liquid Flush.\n\nIt looks like moisturizer,\n\nbut it's the most beautiful color.\n\nI put it on my hand.\n\nThis one is Salzburg, this one is my favorite.\n\nI just wrapped a movie in Budapest. It's a musical.\n\nI don't know how to describe the experience\n\nof shooting Ann Lee, the musical.\n\nIt is unlike anything else I've ever done,\n\nand it's unlike anything I think anyone's ever seen.\n\nI just wrapped Long Bright River,\n\nwhich is the show that's coming out on Peacock,\n\nand that was a lot,\n\nand I didn't have time to do my voice lessons,\n\nwhich I always do.\n\nWhen I was pregnant,\n\nI was doing them three times a week on Zoom,\n\nbut it was okay because the singing wasn't so technical.\n\nIt was more about using my, like, feeling the human.\n\nI'm singing through suffering, I'm singing through joy.\n\nI had to move my body in ways that I wouldn't normally\n\nwhen I'm recording a song, so, you'll see.\n\nThe most important thing since day one\n\nof learning how to do makeup is mascara for me,\n\nbecause I have blonde eyelashes,\n\nand so does my son, that poor boy,\n\nand when I was shooting Limited Too,\n\nI shot Limited Too with Leighton Meester, by the way.\n\nNot a lot of people know that.\n\nEverybody was so pretty and I was just so awkward,\n\nand I had braces at one point,\n\nand I remember going to the bathroom and putting mascara on,\n\nbecause no one was putting mascara on me 'cause I was a kid\n\nand I felt ugly.\n\nThat poor little girl,\n\n'cause I look back at these pictures, they're so beautiful.\n\nLike, we all looked so happy and youthful,\n\nand it goes to show like the pressure we put on ourselves\n\nat such a young age.\n\nAnd, God, my role as a mother is just like to pay attention\n\nto what my girl especially is going through,\n\nbecause she's older\n\nand I just wanna make sure she feels protected\n\nand she feels beautiful,\n\nand it doesn't have to do with the length\n\nor color of your eyelashes or eyebrows.\n\nIt's more about us and less about what the world is seeing.\n\nFlutter Extension Idole Mascara. It's new.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nThis is the matte lipstick, which I love,\n\nbecause I honestly, I don't put it all over my lips.\n\nI learned on a shoot once in London\n\nthat you can smudge the matte\n\nand it looks actually way cooler.\n\nSo I'm gonna do this a little bit, and go like this.\n\nI love a red lip at night.\n\nFor the daytime, I don't wanna scare people.\n\nSometimes when you rub your lips,\n\nthey look a little plump.\n\nDo I look like I'm going to the prom? No.\n\nBut I could totally go glam grocery shopping,\n\nand I can also just go out to lunch and I look clean.\n\nThe last thing I do,\n\nwhich is actually really fun because I am super translucent,\n\nis my friend Roxy, who I work with very often,\n\nshe made this Bronze Glow Mist.\n\nThis is just giving health.\n\n[can hisses]\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a color,\n\nand it looks like you've just been to the beach.\n\nMy hair was done, like, full disclosure,\n\nDJ Quintero did my hair yesterday.\n\nFruit press.\n\nIt's giving, she didn't just wake up,\n\nbut I swear to God, haven't brushed it.\n\nI have good hair, I'm gonna admit it,\n\nI know I have good hair,\n\nbut with good hair comes eczema, you know,\n\nit's gotta balance out the scales.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "What was it like to revisit these characters all these years later?\n\nTom Basden: I definitely think we’ve finally got to the right age to play these characters. We wrote it from the perspective of being in our mid-40s rather than our early 20s. All the things that are bubbling away in the film felt like the concerns when you hit our age now, like the fact that Tim’s character is quietly grieving and has accepted a sort of isolation in this middle of his life and my character has had this first flush of success and now is trying to find a way to stay relevant. We wanted to tell the story of people having changed over time and looking back at a time in their lives when they were really happy and excited and innocent, and you can only really do that when you’ve got some years on the clock.\n\nCarey, what drew you to this role? Did you know Tom and Tim before this?\n\nCarey Mulligan: I didn’t know them personally, but I knew their work and was a big fan. It was one of the best scripts I’ve read, just lovely and so funny. It looked at the fact that music plays such an enormous part in our lives. There’ll be a time when you’ll choose the song to be played at a christening, a wedding, or a funeral. We do soundtrack our lives regardless of whether we’re massive music fans or not, and this script tapped into that in such a brilliant way.\n\nTim, you play a compulsive chatterbox. How much of that was improv?\n\nKey: We try to write the script precisely, but once you start doing it on set, there’s a lot of license to play around. Tom and I have worked together for years, so we understand each other’s rhythms, and actually, it can improve it if you throw a very small curveball to disrupt the other guy. Carey organically fell right in with that, elevating all those rhythms. Before she arrives onscreen, everything’s a little awkward, and the magical thing that Carey brought was turning it into a really warm friendship between the three of them.\n\nTom, you wrote all the songs in the film, some 25 songs in total. How did you manage that?",

        "content": "Downton Abbey famously ran for six seasons between 2010 and 2015 (although it should have stopped at three), with Downton Abbey: The Motion Picture released in 2019. If the series proper concluded in 1925, the first movie takes place two years later, in 1927, and revolves around the Crawleys and their staff foiling an assassination plot mounted against King George V. The second film, which premiered in 2022, had a meta twist to it, centering on the shooting of a “moving picture” at the Abbey (with a sojourn to the South of France thrown in for good measure).\n\nThen, last year, Focus Features confirmed that production on the third and final film, titled Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, was underway, with Paul Giamatti reprising his role as Cora’s England-averse American brother, Harold Levinson, alongside Dominic West (who will be revisiting his part from Downton Abbey: A New Era), Elizabeth McGovern, Hugh Bonneville, Michelle Dockery, Laura Carmichael, Jim Carter, Phyllis Logan, Joanne Froggatt, Penelope Wilton, et al.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Focus Features\n\nConspicuous in her absence from that announcement, however, was The Crown’s Imelda Staunton, who appeared as lady-in-waiting Maud Bagshaw in both Downton Abbey: The Motion Picture and Downton Abbey: A New Era, and is, of course, married to Jim Carter of Carson fame. Back in March 2024, she told BBC Radio 2’s Zoe Ball that, yes, “There will be a final film—there you go.” Ball, in terribly British fashion, then apologized if she had prompted Staunton to speak out of NDA-clad turn. The Oscar nominee’s Violet Crawley-esque response? “I don’t care.” She’s sure to be missed by fans, as will, of course, be the late, great Maggie Smith.\n\nAnd as for those joining the Downton Abbey franchise for the first time? Expect to see Joely Richardson, Alessandro Nivola, Simon Russell Beale and Arty Froushan. Meanwhile, the show’s creator, Julian Fellowes, has penned the third feature; the second film’s helmer, Simon Curtis, is returning to direct; and while plot details are under wraps, a clip has been released showing the ensemble preparing for a table read. The sweeping music alone is enough to give you goosebumps.",

        "content": "Love is a many-splendored thing, especially when you’re gawking at it from the outside. In this column, we’ll be examining the celebrity couples that give us hope for our own romantic futures and trying to learn what we can from their well-documented bonds.\n\nOkay, let’s get one thing clear: I do not wish I had gotten engaged at 19, as Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown did to Jake Bongiovi in 2023, but that’s mainly because my pool of suitors at the time was pretty much limited to whoever hadn’t paired off at the frat party yet and wasn’t giving active “I will murder you, and there will eventually be a gripping campus documentary about your death” vibes. That said, young love is real, and that’s what Brown and Bongiovi appear to have found; the two famously got married in Italy in the spring of 2024, which makes their recent instance of PDA at the Miami Open all the more impressive. I mean, having the romantic energy to publicly canoodle with your spouse a year after the wedding bells have rung is really something. Also, Bongiovi’s parents were there? And it didn’t deter him from making out with his wife? Iconic.\n\nThere’s also something both quaint and extremely of-the-moment about ending up with someone you met remotely. Brown told Wired in 2023 that she first encountered Bongiovi on Instagram, recalling: “We were friends for a bit, and then…what can I say?” This appears to be how the young Hollywood set meets each other now, and not that literally any member of young Hollywood asked, but I approve. It has to be easier to get to know someone via social media or text than in the greenroom of Jimmy Kimmel Live! or the bathroom of some too-expensive restaurant in West Hollywood (I’m looking at you, Horses), or wherever else two celebs might come across each other in person.\n\nOn a recent episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast, Brown added that it didn’t take long for her and Bongiovi to decide that they were it for each other. “We had dogs together, and we were taking care of our animals, and we started living this day-to-day life, and I thought, ‘Oh, I really don’t think I could ever see you as anything else. I don’t want to be with anyone else ever again. I don’t want to date, I don’t want to meet anyone, I want you,’” Brown recalled. Mazel on living the dream, you crazy kids!",
