We've been dealing with each other for a long time and very well there. We had a little negotiation spat, but that worked out great, I think, for both countries.\"\n\nZelenskyy was also optimistic about an agreement that would have given the United States access to critical minerals from Ukraine.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 28, 2025.

Craig Hudson/Reuters, FILE\n\nDuring a lengthy hearing Monday, Jackson grew frustrated with a lack of clear answers from either side about the current state of the CFPB. Lawyers with the Department of Justice argued the relief requested by the federal unions who brought the lawsuit amounted to putting the CFPB into receivership, while the plaintiffs argued the Trump administration was causing irreparable harm by slowly starving the agency.\n\n\"According to the plaintiff, the sky is falling. According to the defendant, if I issue the order, the sky will be falling,\" Jackson remarked.\n\nJackson is considering issuing a preliminary injunction to block the dismantling of the CFPB but added she might consider additional relief if the plaintiffs can demonstrate that the government's actions are causing irreparable harm.\n\n\"I think what we're talking about is interim oversight to make sure that it hasn't been choked out of its very existence before I get to rule on the merits,\" she said.\n\nIn a sworn court filing last week, Martinez argued the changes at the CFPB -- which has operated under a stop work order for the last month -- are simply a \"common practice at the beginning of a new administration.\" Jackson raised skepticism to the idea that what's happening at the CFPB is business as usual.\n\n\"One of the big defenses of all this is that this is normal, that this is what happens when the new team comes to town, and I'm just not sure that's true at all, at least not since I've been here,\" she remarked. \"Are you telling me that ... when President Reagan took over from President Carter -- on top of freezing regulations and enforcement and litigation -- fired all provisional employees, shut the building, stopped all work and said the funding should stop?\"\n\nDemonstrators protest against cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by President Donald Trump and Elon Musks's DOGE initiative, as a hearing is scheduled to take place at the E.

It’s a consumer watchdog aimed at protecting American households from unfair and deceptive practices across the financial services industry.\n\nIts oversight applies to everything from mortgages to credit cards to bank fees to student loans to data collection. By law, the CFPB has the rare ability to issue new rules and to impose fines against companies who break them.\n\nSince its establishment in 2011 through last June, the CFPB said it has clawed back $20.7 billion for American consumers.\n\nABC News' Elizabeth Schulze contributed to this report.",

Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid numerous sexual harassment allegations in 2021, is running for New York City mayor.\n\nThe former governor made the announcement Saturday in a video on X, ending weeks of speculation.\n\n\"Our city is in crisis. That’s why I am running to be Mayor of New York City. We need government to work. We need effective leadership,\" he said.\n\nCuomo, a Democrat, will run against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and other candidates in the June 24 primary, in a ranked choice vote ballot.\n\nIn this Aug. 2, 2021, file photo, Governor Andrew Cuomo holds a press briefing and makes an announcement to combat COVID-19 Delta variant, in New York. Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe conclusion of Cuomo's governorship was mired in scandal. At least 11 women -- some of whom were state employees -- accused him of sexual harassment, including several alleged instances of suggestive comments and unwanted touching.\n\nA probe by New York state Attorney General Letitia James found Cuomo had \"engaged in conduct constituting sexual harassment under federal and New York State law.\"\n\nHis behavior \"created a hostile work environment for women,\" the probe found, and in at least one case, he was found to have retaliated against one of his accusers.\n\nCuomo defended himself in the scandal's aftermath, denying any wrongdoing even upon his resignation.\n\n\"I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances. That's not who I am,\" he said in a televised address in response to James' report.\n\nEven so, Cuomo acknowledged \"that there are generational or cultural perspectives that frankly I hadn't fully appreciated,\" saying he had \"learned from this.\"\n\nIn addition to the harassment scandal, Cuomo also came under scrutiny for allegations his administration concealed damaging information about nursing home deaths during the pandemic.\n\nCuomo was grilled on allegedly underreporting COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes during a GOP-led House committee hearing in September 2024. Cuomo largely stood by his decision-making during the pandemic -- including a March 2020 directive to readmit COVID-19 patients back into nursing homes -- and blamed the outsized death toll on what he described as then-President Donald Trump's lack of leadership.\n\n\"Every night, we got a census from the nursing homes, total nursing home deaths, total hospital deaths,\" Cuomo said during the combative hearing. \"The numbers were less than certain, and they were highly problematic, because you were calling up a nursing home and basically asking them to do a forensic audit in the middle of a pandemic.\"\n\nCuomo also testified that he never directed his staff to report the number of nursing home-related fatalities as lower than they actually were.\n\n\"No, we said these are the numbers without the out-of-facility death numbers, which we will add when they're accurate,\" Cuomo said in the hearing.\n\nThe former governor subtly acknowledged his scandals in his video.\n\n\"Did I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not. Would I do some things differently knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes, some painfully? Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it and I hope to show that every day,\" he said.\n\n\"But I promise you this, I know what needs to be done and I know how to do it, and I will give it my all to get the job done -- and it will get done,\" he added.\n\nCuomo enters a crowded race that includes City Comptroller Brad Lander, state Rep. Zohran Mamdani and state Sens. Jessica Ramos and Zellnor Myrie.\n\nMinutes after Cuomo's video went live, Lander released a statement slamming the former governor for his past actions.\n\n\"Andrew Cuomo is for himself and only himself, and is hoping New Yorkers will forget his disastrous record for our city of endless scandals, destroying the subway, and cutting basic services,\" he said.\n\nFormer City Comptroller Scott Stringer, whose 2021 mayoral campaign was marred by sexual misconduct allegations, is also running.\n\nStringer has denied those allegations. He said he did not remember one woman who accused him of unwanted sexual advances, but added, \"If I ever did anything to make her uncomfortable, I am sorry.\"\n\nEven before officially announcing his mayoral candidacy, Cuomo had begun racking up endorsements.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ritchie Torres previously told the New York Post that Cuomo would have his endorsement \"as soon as he enters the race.\"\n\n\"Andrew Cuomo has the competence to govern the city,\" Torres told the Post. \"He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics -- both from the far-left and far-right. We don't need a Mr. Nice Guy. We need a Mr. Tough Guy.\"\n\nIn this Sept. 10, 2024, file photo, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo arrives to testify before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic in the Rayburn House Office Building at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.

He previously pleaded not guilty to a five-count indictment that accused him of accepting years of luxury travel gifts in exchange for, among other things, allegedly persuading the New York City Fire Department to approve the opening of the new Turkish consulate in Manhattan despite the lingering safety concerns of inspectors.\n\nIn February, the Justice Department moved to drop the case against Adams, which prompted the resignations of seven federal prosecutors and four deputy mayors.\n\nDespite expressing concerns about Adams' continued leadership, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declined to remove him as mayor, saying \"the will of the voters and the supremacy and sanctity of democratic elections preclude me from any other action.\"\n\n\"I cannot deny the people of this great city the power to make this decision for themselves,\" Hochul said.\n\nABC News' Mary Kekatos contributed to this report.",

Experts say that Ukraine and its European partners now produce most of the weaponry destined for the battlefield. But there are crucial American systems that Kyiv will struggle to replace.\n\n\"It's shocking,\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News. \"Until the last moment I hoped that Trump wouldn't do it because he wants to be popular and such a move would definitely cause a backlash.\"\n\n\"Trump is helping Putin to kill Ukrainians,\" he added.\n\nA Ukrainian intelligence official told ABC News that the first real effects of the freeze of U.S. military aid will be felt in about two weeks. The most serious difficulties will come in June or July, when ammunition shortages will bite, they said.\n\nThe official called the freeze a \"black day\" for Ukraine and for Europe. European countries, they said, now need to fully open their stocks to Kyiv in order to fill the gap being left by the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Mar. 3, 2025. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nA White House official told ABC News that Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well,\" they said. \"We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"\n\n\"It looks like Trump is trying to make a deal with Russia over the heads of Ukraine and Europe at the cost of Ukraine,\" Merezhko said. \"He doesn't apply leverage over the aggressor but is trying to force the victim, the weaker party, to accept demands of the aggressor.\"\n\n\"If Trump has a different plan in mind he should have at least talked to Zelenskyy about it behind closed doors, which never happened,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nFellow member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko told Sky News that \"thousands of people will die\" due to the \"catastrophic\" decision.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal told a press conference that Kyiv is \"working to ensure the support of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We are grateful to the United States and the American people, who have supported and continue to support Ukraine for the past three years. Today, that support continues.\"\n\n\"We will calmly continue our work with the U.S. -- with Congress and the Trump administration -- to continue the fight for a stable, lasting peace,\" Shmyhal added. \"Ukraine is firmly committed to continuing cooperation. I am confident that support from the U.S. will continue. We are looking for ways for pragmatic cooperation and are ready to sign, including an agreement on minerals.\"\n\nAllied leaders and officials -- already mobilizing to provide more aid and political backing for Ukraine in response to the Trump administration's skepticism -- also expressed concern over the White House decision.\n\n\"We need the Americans militarily,\" Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said during a Chatham House think tank event in London on Tuesday when asked about the aid pause. \"On the battlefield, Russia has not really been advancing in recent months,\" she added. \"This definitely shouldn't be a moment where we give in.\"\n\nBenjamin Haddad, The French minister delegate for Europe, said the pause to U.S. aid \"means moving peace further away.\" He added, \"To end the war, pressure must be put on the aggressor, Russia,\" suggesting European nations must now mobilize to fill the gap left by the U.S.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists, \"It is obvious that the U.S. has been the main supplier of this war so far,\" as quoted by the state-run Tass news agency. \"If the U.S. stops being one or suspends supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,\" Peskov said.\n\nTwo officials familiar with the matter told ABC News that around 90% of the military equipment committed to Ukraine by past Presidential Drawdown Authority packages have already been delivered to the country.\n\nThat includes the vast majority of critical munitions and anti-armor systems -- such as Javelin anti-tank weapons -- they said, adding that most of what is still in the pipeline are armored vehicles that take longer to refurbish. Those were expected to be ready for delivery in the coming months, with all PDA equipment previously on track for delivery by August 2025.\n\nA steady flow of arms is still set to move from the U.S. to Ukraine for at least the next several years thanks to contracts Kyiv signed with private American companies for newly produced weapons.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman looks out of a U.S.-made M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle in Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine, on Feb. 18, 2025. Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters\n\nMany -- if not most -- of those contracts have been paid. The Trump administration could still attempt to disrupt those shipments through the use of emergency authorities, but there is currently no indication it is trying to do so.\n\nExactly what equipment earmarked for Ukraine will now be frozen in place is not clear.\n\nAmong former President Joe Biden's final four PDA packages announced in December and January -- collectively worth some $3 billion -- were missiles and support equipment for Ukraine's U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, rockets for use by American-made HIMARS systems, artillery munitions and surface-to-air missiles for Ukrainian air defense batteries.\n\nThe most immediate impacts of the U.S. freeze will on air defense, leaving Ukrainian forces and cities more exposed to Russian drones and missiles, the Ukrainian intelligence official said. There will also be a lack of HIMARS long-range rocket artillery, which Ukraine has no analogue for.\n\nUkraine will start to experience potentially serious artillery ammunition shortages by mid-summer, they said, which will weaken the defense line. The official said this could even increase the risk of a Russian breakthrough.\n\nThe official also warned that the freeze could trigger a political crisis in Ukraine by increasing tensions within the country.\n\nMalcolm Chalmers, the deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the U.K., told ABC News that recent estimates indicate the U.S. share of all military hardware sent to the front has fallen to around 20%, with 25% coming from Europe and 55% domestically produced in Ukraine.\n\nBut the 20% accounted for by the U.S. \"is the most lethal and important,\" Chalmers said. \"Ukraine will not collapse -- they already experienced an aid cutoff last year. But the effect will be cumulative.\"\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman sits near artillery shells as he and a soldier await the command to fire an M777 howitzer towards Russian positions in the Donetsk region of Ukraine on Feb. 8, 2025.

Forty-eight percent approve of his performance, the poll found.\n\nThe survey -- conducted from Feb. 24-28 -- before the explosive argument between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office Friday afternoon -- also found that a majority of respondents said Trump has not adequately addressed the country's most pressing concerns.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Vice President JD Vance reacts at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 28, 2025. Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nLast week, a separate Washington Post/Ipsos Poll found Trump's approval rating at 45% with 53% of Americans disapproving. Also, 57% said the president has exceeded his authority since taking office.\n\nThe poll also found that only 34% approve of how Elon Musk is handling his role in firing federal workers as part of the Department of Government Efficiency -- with 49% disapproving.\n\nDean Lacy, professor of government at Dartmouth College, said he anticipates Trump's approval rating may hover around these numbers for some time.\n\n\"He's probably going to be locked around a 50% approval rating for a while,\" Lacy said. \"The approval rating itself, the numbers maybe don't indicate the depth of sentiment toward him, even though his approval rating is 50-52%. I think he has a 40-45% of the public that loves him and 40 or 45% that despises him. And that's not going to change much, regardless of what he does. It would take a lot to shake up.\"\n\nTrump's approval rating numbers come as Republicans have been facing pushback from constituents angry about Trump's role in Musk's cuts across the federal government.\n\nMany Republicans are grappling with how to align with Trump and still appease constituents moving forward, Lacy said.\n\n\"The harder issues, the bigger issues, the tougher issues are coming up, and those are the ones that people will be deciding how to vote on in another two years,\" he said.\n\nRep.

Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump's current job approval rating of 45% is the second lowest for presidents at this point in their term dating to Harry Truman, according to recent data from Gallup. The lowest was Trump himself at 40% in February 2017.\n\nPresidential approval ratings after first weeks in office ABC News\n\nTrump has the lowest favorability rating of recent presidents at this point in their presidency. His 44% favorability -- as found in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll -- is 15 percentage points lower than Biden's in February 2021, and similar to Trump's rating of 46% in February 2017.\n\nPresidential favorability ratings after first weeks in office ABC News\n\nStill, the Trump administration is touting the president's accomplishments, with a recent White House press release claiming that he \"has already accomplished more than most presidents do in their entire term as he makes good on his promise to usher in the New Golden Age of America.\"\n\nYet a majority of people (52%) said that Trump has not paid enough attention to the country's most important problems, according to the CNN poll. Forty percent said he has the right priorities; 8% were unsure.\n\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Trump said he had a mandate from the American people following his victory in November and would work to deliver on his promises.\n\n\"The people have given us a resounding mandate for dramatic change in Washington, and we're going to deliver it, we're going to use it, and we're going to make America great again by using it,\" Trump said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the East Room at the White House, Feb. 27, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Carl Court/Pool via Reuters\n\nThe economy and the cost of living -- long-identified as a top voter issue during the presidential election -- remain top priorities for the Trump administration, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\n\"I can assure the American people that the president is very much focused on bringing down the cost-of-living crisis in this country,\" she said in a White House press briefing last week.\n\nMany Americans have said that Trump is focusing on the policies \"that many Americans don't like, or don't consider very important\" -- such as the economy and inflation, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. The poll, conducted last month, found that 58% of respondents said inflation would be a major factor in deciding their vote in future elections. But just 32% approved of the job Trump was doing on inflation.\n\nLacy said the economy is they most important issue for many Americans, and Trump, who has promised to bring down prices, will need to address it.\n\n\"I think he has some explaining to do. I think he already started that explaining by saying, 'we'll go through a period of pain' as he threatens and possibly imposes tariffs. But this pain can't last very long, so he has to lay out what he thinks the future will look like, what his plans will be and when Americans can expect to see those prices go down and the stock market go up,\" Lacy said.\n\nThe Trump administration has acknowledged the challenge with the economy, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying on Sunday that they are \"tackling\" it.\n\n\"I think President Trump said that he'll own the economy in six or 12 months. But I can tell you that we are working to get these prices down every day,\" Bessent said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. \"But it took four years to get us here, and we've had five weeks.\"\n\nLanger Research Associates' Christine Filer contributed to this report.",

We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Mar. 3, 2025. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nThe move came hours after Trump told ABC News that Zelenskyy needed to be \"more appreciative.\"\n\nSenior Politics Correspondent Rachel Scott asked Trump on Tuesday: \"What do you need to see from President Zelenskyy to restart these negotiations?\"\n\n\"Well, I just think he should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin,\" the president responded.\n\nIt's difficult to know exactly how the pause could impact the flow of previously granted aid.\n\nIn the last few months of former President Joe Biden's administration, it announced four Presidential Drawdown Authority packages to Ukraine.\n\nThe packages totaled $3 billion in weapons from the Pentagon's inventory, and they were meant to be provided to Ukraine as quickly as possible following the announcements in December and January.\n\nAbout 90% of arms committed to Ukraine by past PDA packages have already been delivered to the country, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThat includes the vast majority of critical munitions and anti-armor systems, they say, adding that most of the what’s left to go through the pipeline are armored vehicles that take longer to refurbish, with all PDA equipment previously on track for delivery by August 2025.\n\nHowever, a steady flow of arms is still set to move from the U.S. to Ukraine for at least the next several years due contracts Kyiv signed with private American companies for newly produced weapons. Many if not most of those contracts have been paid.\n\nThe Trump administration could still attempt to disrupt those shipments through the use of emergency authorities, but there’s no indication it is trying to do that at present.\n\nAdditionally, there is still a chance for negotiations to resume between the U.S. and Ukraine, as Vice President JD Vance implied during an appearance on Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Monday.\n\nVance was asked if the administration would welcome Zelenskyy back if he were willing to come back to the negotiating table. Vance said yes -- if Zelenskyy were willing to \"engage seriously.\"\n\n\"I think that if he called and had a serious proposal for how he was going to engage in the process -- look, there are details that really matter, that we're already working on with the Russians,\" Vance said.\n\n\"He needs to engage seriously on the details,\" he added, though it was unclear if he was strictly referring to the raw minerals deal that the U.S. is pursuing with Ukraine, land concessions or other details that may be impacting negotiations.\n\n\"I think once that happens, then absolutely, we want to talk,\" the vice president said.\n\nAlso in dispute is the amount of aid that the U.S. has already given Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly claimed, inaccurately, that the United States has spent some $350 billion toward Ukraine, while other sources put the figure well under $200 billion, including bilateral aid.\n\nABC News' Shannon Kingston, Luis Martinez and T.

In addition to the $8.8 billion alleged savings in canceled contracts, the new data on the site lists $660 million worth of real estate leases under the GSA that were canceled, and, for the first time, it lists federal government grants that have been terminated, totaling $10.3 billion.\n\nAmong the contracts that have been deleted from DOGE's latest \"Wall of Receipts\" is the biggest contract it had listed as having canceled last week: a seven-year blanket purchase agreement from the IRS with $1.9 billion cap for \"IT strategy and modernization.\"\n\nElon Musk, his son, XX Æ A-Xii, and Musk's mother, Maye Musk arrive at the White House's South Lawn, after arriving on Marine One with President Donald Trump on March 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nThe website removed this contract from its \"Wall of Receipts\" after the vendor, financial management and IT company Centennial Technologies, told the New York Times last month that the contract was actually canceled last fall, under the Biden administration.\n\nThe previous week, DOGE had to revise down its largest claimed savings contract from $8 billion to $8 million after the contract's vendor explained that the $8 billion listed on it procurement record was likely a clerical error.\n\nAnother contract that was removed from DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" in the latest updated was a five-year $150 million USAID contract under the Asia Futures Activity initiative, aimed at serving the USAID's Asia Bureau to solve \"interconnected challenges of economic growth, democratic governance, and resilience in the face of increasing health, climate, and food security threats.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Cadmus Group, which had received that contract, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nDOGE also deleted from its latest \"Wall of Receipts\" what appeared to be a $149 million National Institute of Health contract awarded to software company Advanced Automation Technologies.\n\nLast week, the DOGE website listing that contract linked to a different NIH contract for leasing and maintaining refrigerated gas tanks. An NIH contract with Advanced Automation Technologies that shares the same contract ID is capped at just $1.4 million -- not the $149 million figure that had been listed by DOGE.\n\nOther terminated contracts listed in this week's data include a USAID contract for the Ukraine Confidence Building Initiative with a $256 million ceiling, from which DOGE claims to have saved $170 million that has yet to be obligated to the contractor.\n\nAnother newly listed canceled contract is the USAID's Global Health Training, Advisory, and Support Contract program, a multi-year program that started in 2021 and was capped at $682 million through 2029. DOGE claims to have saved $284 million by terminating this program.\n\nThe single biggest contract listed this week is a seven-year IT services contract from the USAID to the vendor Salient CRGT Inc., with a $597 million ceiling.\n\nSimilar to last week's data, DOGE now lists more than 940 contracts where contract obligations have already been fully delivered -- meaning that 40% of the contracts they claim to have terminated will not actually result in saving any money.\n\nAsked about contracts that list $0 in savings last week, a White House official told ABC News that they're using a conservative methodology of calculating savings because they subtract the contracts' obligated dollars from the ceiling amounts. However, for many contracts the ceiling dollars are much higher than what is actually expected to be spent.\n\nFor the $10.3 billion in federal grants the sites says it's terminated, DOGE lists each of the 3,389 grants with the name of the awarding agency and the amount of each grant, but does not lists the grant's name or purpose.\n\nSo far, much of the claimed savings from these grants have come from the USAID -- totaling $8.7 billion -- followed by $1.1 billion from the State Department, $472 million from the Education Department and $61 million from the EPA.\n\nDOGE has also updated its list of real estate leases that have been terminated, totaling $660 million. But much of the data is now missing information regarding which agency the leases were under, whereas the site previously listed leases from across more than 40 agencies.\n\nThe current data shows $143 million worth of real estate leases under the GSA that were terminated, and the rest of the terminated leases-- totaling $516 million -- do not list their agencies.\n\nDOGE said last week that it would begin updating its website twice a week, but the current update, like the first two, came after a week.",

The richest man in the world is telling Americans that earned benefits that they depend on and they paid into are a scam. They are not a scam. And if Americans know it,\" Schumer said.\n\nAsked about the Biden-appointed former Social Security commissioner Martin O'Malley's recent prediction that a system collapse and an interruption of benefits could come within the next 30-90 days, Murray responded that the recent cuts to workforce and offices would be a \"disaster.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, when you're firing this many people, closing that many offices -- don't have people to write the checks, you are looking for disaster,\" Murray said.\n\nElon Musk walks on Capitol Hill on the day of a meeting with Senate Republican Leader-elect John Thune in Washington, Dec. 5, 2024. Benoit Tessier/Reuters, FILES\n\nA government-funding connection?\n\nAsked if Democrats would insist on preventing the cuts as part of a deal to bring a temporary funding ('CR' or continuing resolution) bill up for a vote, to keep the government open, Murray said \"We are looking at a number of different\" things pertaining to a funding deal.\n\n\"I'll just say this. The only one who wants a shutdown right now is Elon Musk … nobody else wants a shutdown. We are all working to get this done,\" Murray said.\n\nMurray said that the best way to fund the government and avoid a shutdown would be through a CR.\n\n\"In my opinion, the best way to do this is to do a short-term CR. Our committees are capable of getting this done with this short term CR, and ready to go to work.\"\n\nShe also said the White House sending an \"anomalies\" list to Congress was \"completely inadequate\" and then reaffirmed that Democrats were \"at the table\" and \"ready\" to pass a short-term CR.\n\nWorking with House Democrats to block Social Security cuts\n\nSchumer referenced former President George W. Bush's proposed cuts to Social Security programs in 2005, likening his current plans to work with House members in order to block any rollbacks to the work he did with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid 20 years ago.\n\n\"We got together. We said we're going to fight it, and we won. I will tell the American people, we're getting together, House and Senate Democrats, we're going to fight it, and guess what? We're going to prevent the cuts,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"But we need your help,\" he said. \"We need every person who's a recipient or would-be recipient who would like to get this benefit to call their congressmen– their Republican congressman and senators -- and give one simple sentence. 'Hands off my Social Security.'\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have insisted that Republicans won't try to cut Social Security benefits or benefits from other entitlement programs.",

Its decision could have a significant impact on firearm companies and the victims of gun violence pursuing accountability.\n\nWeapons seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection during southbound inspections are displayed at the Port of Nogales, Ariz. Undated file photo. CPB/DVIDS\n\nThe government of Mexico is seeking $10 billion in damages and court-mandated safety mechanisms and sales restrictions for U.S.-made guns. The justices will decide whether the case can move forward under an exception in the law.\n\n\"Between 70-90% of the crime guns in Mexico are illegally trafficked from the U.S.,\" said Jonathan Lowy, an attorney representing the Mexican government. \"Essentially, Mexico's gun problem and the problem of armed cartel violence is almost entirely a result of this crime -- a gun pipeline from the U.S. gun manufacturers ultimately to the cartels.\"\n\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005 broadly bars lawsuits against any gun manufacturer over the illegal acts of a person using one of a manufacturer's guns. But it does create an exception for claims involving a gun company's alleged violation of rules governing the sale and marketing of firearms.\n\nMexico alleges the manufacturers have for years knowingly marketed and distributed their weapons to border community dealers who participate in illegal gun trafficking into Mexico.\n\nWeapons seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection during southbound inspections are displayed at the Port of Nogales, Ariz.

CPB/DVIDS\n\n\"The law is clear that any person or company can be responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their actions and, in this case, of their deliberate actions,\" Lowy said.\n\nThe gun companies, which declined ABC News' request for an interview, said in court documents that the exception does not apply and the case should be dismissed, in part, because the alleged link to crimes in Mexico is too diffuse and far removed.\n\n\"Mexico's alleged injuries all stem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals,\" the gun companies argued in their Supreme Court brief.\n\nThe court has \"repeatedly held that it requires a direct connection between a defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury,\" the companies claimed. \"Thus, the general rule is that a company that makes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate cause of harms resulting from the independent criminal misuse of that product.\"\n\nA view of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, July 19, 2024. Kevin Mohatt/Reuters, FILE\n\nMore than 160,000 people in Mexico were killed by guns between 2015 and 2022, according to an analysis by Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nA large majority of guns involved in the shootings came from U.S. border states. More than 40% of illegal guns seized in Mexico over a five-year period came from Texas, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report.\n\nIn 2023 alone, more than 2,600 firearms were seized going south into Mexico, up 65% from the year before, according to the Department of Homeland Security, and 115,000 rounds of ammunition were captured headed the same direction, up 19% from 2022.\n\n\"In its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico seeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that safeguard the whole economy,\" the companies wrote in their brief. \"It is the criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the company that made or sold the product.\"\n\nA federal district court dismissed Mexico's case in 2022 citing the PLCAA protections. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in early 2024, saying Mexico had made a plausible case for liability under the law's exception.\n\nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum looks on during her daily press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City on Feb. 28, 2025. Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide whether to affirm that judgment and allow the case to continue toward what would be a first-of-its-kind trial.\n\nMexico, in the meantime, announced it will expand its lawsuit after the Trump administration designated six Mexican cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\n\n\"You will also see an expansion of this lawsuit for the complicity of those who sell weapons, which are [then] introduced into our country,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters last month.\n\nIn essence, Mexico will argue that American gun manufacturers aren't just enabling ordinary gun crime but terrorism, by the U.S. government's own characterization.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to deliver an opinion in the case, Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, by the end of June.\n\nABC News' Matt Rivers and Patty See contributed to this report.",

        "content": "It comes as he moves with lightning speed to forcibly enact his agenda.\n\nTrump to address Congress and nation as he tests limits of presidential power\n\nDonald Trump, six weeks into a historic comeback to the White House, on Tuesday heads to Capitol Hill to address Congress and the nation as a reinvented president relentlessly testing the limits of executive power.\n\nTrump will step up to the dais at 9 p.m. ET to lay out his goals for the next four years and tout the actions he's taken so far, many of them challenging constitutional restraints on his authority versus Congress and the courts.\n\nThe president teased on Monday it would be a \"big night\" and House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News over the weekend to expect \"fireworks.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. 28, 2017. J. Scott Applewhite/AP, FILES\n\nThe theme of his address will be the \"Renewal of the American Dream,\" a White House official told ABC News.\n\nTrump will focus, the official said, on his record thus far, the economy, border security, and what the official called the president's plans for \"peace around the globe.\"\n\nHe will push Congress to pass more border security funding for deportations and the border wall, the official said, and on foreign policy, he's expected to touch on his efforts to help broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“President Trump has accomplished more in one month than any president in four years – and the renewal of the American Dream is well underway,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"In his Joint Address to Congress, President Trump will celebrate his extraordinarily successful first month in office while outlining his bold, ambitious, and common sense vision for the future. President Trump’s Joint Address will be MUST-SEE TV.”\n\nThe speech comes as Trump moves with lightning speed to enact his agenda, including an immigration crackdown and radical overhaul of the federal government -- the latter with the help of his unelected enforcer Elon Musk, who will be in the House chamber looking on.\n\nAs some of the dust settles from that blitz, a 538 analysis of public opinion polls found Trump himself to be more popular than many of his administration's policies. And his approval rating, while higher than at this same point in his first term, is still underwater at 45%, according to Gallup.\n\nPromises kept?\n\nTrump has signed 76 executive orders since his inauguration, according to the Federal Register.\n\nBarbara Perry, co-chair of the Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, said she expects Trump's speech to start off on the theme of \"promises made, promises kept.\"\n\n\"I suspect there will be some chest-pounding and drawing attention to the fact that historically, this is one of the most active and productive first 100 days and we're not even at the 100-day mark yet,\" Perry said. \"They're off the blocks really quickly.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 10, 2025, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP, FILE\n\nHis executive actions include many of the culture war issues he campaigned on -- such as ending federal DEI programs, making English the country's official language, declaring the government will only recognize a person's sex assigned at birth and banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports.\n\nOn immigration, Trump could promote border crossings dropping significantly in January and the Department of Homeland Security arresting thousands of migrants illegally in the country. But his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, has expressed frustration with the pace of deportations so far, and the administration abruptly cleared migrants from Guantanamo Bay after pledging to use the military base to house the \"worst of the worst.\" Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, another signature 2024 pledge, has been temporarily blocked by the courts.\n\nOn foreign policy, in addition to his efforts to start peace talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war, the White House official said he can be expected to talk about the Middle East, although his brazen Gaza takeover plan has little public buy-in from regional power players and the administration's reversal of American policy toward Russia and away from Ukraine has prompted concern among European allies.\n\nOn the economy, Trump can be expected to highlight tariffs he'simposed against Canada and Mexico that went into place on Tuesday, as well as additional taxes against China. But inflation continues to be a persistent problem, with some economists predicting tariffs could raise prices more, and the cost of eggs have skyrocketed amid the prevalence of avian flu.\n\nBut the Trump initiative that's been the most controversial is the slashing of the federal bureaucracy, which is being largely overseen by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The dismantling of agencies like USAID, wholesale firings of federal workers and cutting of funds already appropriated by Congress is prompting widespread confusion and several legal challenges. Trump has defended Musk so far, including in his first Cabinet meeting last week where Musk spoke despite not being a Cabinet member.\n\nHis message to Congress?\n\nTrump will address Congress as Republicans hold majorities in both the House and Senate. Despite the trifecta, Trump is pushing an expansive view of executive power that questions the role of Congress and the courts to serve as a check over federal agencies.\n\nHow aggressively he articulates that stance in front of the lawmakers and Supreme Court justices in attendance will be something to watch, said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\"I think the big question is, what does he feel like he needs from Congress? The general sense of the second Trump administration has been to come out of the gates guns blaring, wanting to accomplish everything themselves,\" Wallach said. \"In some ways, it seems like they mostly want Congress to stay out of their way and to cheer them on in their effort to transform the government.\"\n\nThe Capitol is seen on March 3, 2025, in Washington. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n\n\"But it's not clear just how far they can go without new laws from Congress, including some that go ahead and dismantle previous programs,\" Wallach noted.\n\nThe first big legislative test will be the budget reconciliation bill that will fund much of Trump's agenda, though more pressing will be averting a government shutdown next week.\n\nBack in 2017, during his first-ever joint address to Congress, Trump made a pitch for unity. It was generally regarded as one of his best political speeches, said University of Michigan speech and debate expert Aaron Kall.\n\nKall doesn't expect the same tone for Tuesday night's address, contending Trump views himself as having a \"mandate\" from voters after winning both the electoral college and popular vote (though data shows the victory isn't the total landslide Trump has often portrayed it as).\n\n\"I think it will be very totalizing, very self-assured and very partisan in tone,\" Kall said of Trump's upcoming address. \"This will be more in the ilk of a campaign speech.\"",

The S &P suffered its biggest loss since December, closing at 5,849.72 -- down 104.78 points or 1.76%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 43,191.24 down 649.67 points or 1.48%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.64%.\n\nThe deadline arrives roughly one month after Trump granted Mexico and Canada a reprieve from such tariffs, having reached agreements with the two countries regarding border security and drug trafficking.\n\nHere’s what to know about the tariffs that have gone into effect.\n\nTariffs could upend U.S. trade\n\nIn recent days, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to placing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\nOn Feb. 27, Trump alleged that drugs had continued to enter the U.S. through Mexico and Canada despite agreements reached last month to address the issue.\n\n“We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump voiced similar concerns about Mexico and Canada ahead of the previous tariff deadline -- before ultimately pausing the measures.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday praised Mexico and Canada for their recent efforts to address border security, suggesting that the level of the tariffs remained uncertain.\n\n“[Trump] is going to decide today – we're going to put it out tomorrow,” Lutnick told CNN, describing the policymaking as a \"fluid situation.\"\n\nTrump then confirmed that the the fresh round of tariffs would take effect the following day.\n\n\"That will start,\" Trump said. \"They'll have to have tariffs.\"\n\nIf the tariffs stay in place, price increases will be evident by Memorial Day, according to economist Mark Zandi, who also said that prices on food could start rising more quickly -- within weeks.\n\nNew tariffs could raise prices for some essentials\n\nTariffs on Mexico, Canada and China could raise prices for a vast array of goods, experts previously told ABC News.\n\nTariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could hike prices for products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab estimated in February that the tariffs could cost the average household up to $2,000 annually.\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as he meets with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, Feb. 28, 2025. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHigher costs for car production could pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University, told ABC News in a statement.\n\nIn a statement on Monday from the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents members like Ford and General Motors, AAPC President Matt Blunt said, \"Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market.” He called for an exemption from the tariffs for American automakers.\n\nMexico and Canada account for 70% of U.S. crude oil imports, which make up a key input for the nation’s gasoline supply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency.\n\nTrump previously said Canadian energy resources such as oil and gas would be subject to 10% tariffs, excluding the products from 25% tariffs faced by all other imports from the country.\n\nThe U.S. imported $38.5 billion in agricultural goods from Mexico in 2023, making it the top recipient of such products, U.S Department of Agriculture data showed. Those imports include more than $3 billion worth of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nRoughly 90% of avocados eaten in the U.S. last year originated in Mexico, USDA data showed. Other products with a high concentration of Mexican imports include tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, jalapenos, limes and mangos.\n\nTargeted countries may retaliate\n\nThe fresh tariffs may trigger retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China.\n\nIn anticipation of tariffs last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened retaliatory tariffs on $155 billion worth of goods and urged Canadians to choose Canada-made products over their American counterparts. On Monday night, he reaffirmed that commitment, saying that Canada would start with “tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days’ time.”\n\n“Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,” Trudeau said in a statement.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Monday that imposing the tariffs would be an \"absolute disaster\" for both the U.S. and Canada. He added, in part, “I don't want to respond but we will respond like they've never seen before.\"\n\nFord warned if tariffs from the U.S. move forward, Canada will respond.\n\n“We keep the lights on in 1.5 million homes and manufacturing in New York, in Michigan and Minnesota. If he wants to destroy our economy and our families, I will shut down the electricity going down to the U.S. and I'm telling you we will do it,” Ford said.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had instructed officials in her government to implement Plan B, \"which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Sheinbaum said recent talks between the U.S. had gone \"very well\" but that Mexico retains options if necessary.\n\n\"We are going to wait and see what happens,\" Sheinbaum said. \"In that, you need to have mettle, serenity and patience, and we have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D, so we are going to wait for today.\"\n\nAfter Trump amended his executive order on Monday afternoon -- just hours before tariffs were meant to take effect -- effectively increasing China's tariffs by 10% for a total of 20%, a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson responded with a statement calling the move a “typical unilateral and bullying behavior” that will cause “damage to China-US economic and trade cooperation and the normal international trade order.\"\n\n“China hopes that the US will view and handle issues objectively and rationally and return to the right track of properly resolving differences through equal dialogue as soon as possible,” the statement added.\n\nABC News' Anne Flaherty, Zunaira Zaki and Elizabeth Schulze contributed to this report.",

Hodges Supreme Court case that legalized same sex marriage nationwide, is backed by supporters of the courts ruling on same-sex marriage on the step of the Texas Capitol during a rally in Austin, Texas.\n\nConservative legislators are increasingly speaking out against the Supreme Court’s landmark 2015 ruling on same-sex marriage equality.\n\nIdaho legislators began the trend in January when the state House and Senate passed a resolution calling on the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision -- which the court cannot do unless presented with a case on the issue. Some Republican lawmakers in at least four other states like Michigan, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota have followed suit with calls to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn North Dakota, the resolution passed the state House with a vote of 52-40 and is headed to the Senate. In South Dakota, the state’s House Judiciary Committee sent the proposal on the 41st Legislative Day –deferring the bill to the final day of a legislative session, when it will no longer be considered, and effectively killing the bill.\n\nIn Montana and Michigan, the bills have yet to face legislative scrutiny.\n\nResolutions have no legal authority and are not binding law, but instead allow legislative bodies to express their collective opinions.\n\nThe resolutions in four other states echo similar sentiments about the merits of the Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which established the right to same-sex marriage under the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nRep. Josh Schriver on the floor of the Michigan House of Representatives, at the Michigan Capitol, in Lansing, Mich., on Oct. 10, 2023. David Guralnick/Detroit News via AP\n\nSome legislators behind the resolutions argue that the legality of gay marriage should be left to states to decide, while others argue that marriage should be reserved for one man and one woman.\n\nLGBTQ advocates and allies have criticized the efforts, arguing that the majority of Americans approve of same-sex marriage and say the efforts undermine “personal freedoms.”\n\nA 2024 Gallup poll found that 69% of Americans continue to believe that marriage between same-sex couples should be legal, and 64% say gay or lesbian relations are morally acceptable.\n\nJim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court case that legalized same sex marriage nationwide, is backed by supporters of the courts ruling on same-sex marriage on the step of the Texas Capitol during a rally in Austin, Texas. Eric Gay/AP\n\nIn Michigan, state Rep. Josh Schriver unveiled his own anti-gay marriage resolution on Feb. 25, arguing that restrictions on gay marriage are important to “preserve and grow our human race,” he said at a press conference announcing the resolution.\n\n“Michigan Christians follow Christ's definition of marriage as a covenant between a man and a woman, an institution established to glorify God and produce children,” said Schriver.\n\nIn a press release, he added: \"The new resolution urges the preservation of the sanctity of marriage and constitutional protections that ensure freedom of conscience for all Michigan residents.”\n\nLocal Democratic leaders denounced the resolution, arguing that it discriminates against the rights of LGBTQ Americans and distracts from more pressing issues facing Michigan residents.\n\n“At a time when Michiganders are looking to their leaders to address pressing issues like lowering costs and protecting our economy, House Republicans are choosing to focus on undermining the personal freedoms of Michigan residents,” state Rep. Mike McFall said.\n\n“This resolution is not only a blatant attempt to roll back the clock on civil rights, but it is also out of step with the values and priorities of our state.”\n\nThe Michigan resolution has been referred to the Committee on Government Operations and has not yet been put to a vote.\n\nThe handful of resolutions come after Associate Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting the Obergefell decision in his concurring opinion on the Supreme Court's landmark 2022 decision on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case that overturned the federal right to abortion.\n\nHe wrote: \"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this court’s substantive due process precedents,” such as Obergefell. “Because any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous,' we have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents,” Thomas said.\n\nThomas had issued a dissenting opinion in 2015 against same-sex marriage equality.\n\nMore than two dozen states have some kind of restriction on same-sex marriage that could be triggered if the Supreme Court one day overturns its 2015 decision, according to legislative tracking group Movement Advancement Project. This is because marriage equality has not yet been codified and enshrined into law nationwide.\n\nHowever, the Respect for Marriage Law signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022 guarantees the federal recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages in the event of an overturned Supreme Court decision.\n\nIt requires all states to recognize legally certified marriages, even if they were done in a state where it is later banned or done in another state entirely.",

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nTo illustrate the gargantuan gulf between them, many Democrats are bringing recently fired federal workers to attend Trump’s address to showcase the impact of Musk’s slashing of federal agencies.\n\nOf his five guests, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., invited two fired federal workers, including a USAID worker and a disabled Army veteran.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona invited Kyle Rahn, a disabled Army veteran who served three tours in Iraq before working at the Department of Homeland Security, from which he was fired last month.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois invited Adam Mulvey, a 20-year Army veteran who served several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and was fired from his role at Lovell Federal Health Care Center in Spring Grove, Illinois, on Feb. 13.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that DOGE cuts should be part of fiscal 2026 government funding negotiations -- kicking the proverbial can to another year.\n\nBut the speaker said the GOP-controlled House is eyeing a short-term clean government funding bill that would extend current spending levels through the end of September 2025, but the specifics of his strategy remain unclear.\n\nA short-term measure would “make sure that the government can stay open while we begin to incorporate all these savings that we're finding through the DOGE effort and these other sources of revenue that President Trump's policies are -- bringing to the table,” Johnson argued on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\n\nTrump endorsed this plan last week, calling for a clean continuing resolution -- even as hardline Republicans pressure Johnson not to band together again on a bipartisan bill with Democrats, who aren't inclined to help Trump with anything.\n\nSome Republicans have already raised concerns, including Texas GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales, who says he is a no vote on any continuing resolution.\n\n“I am a NO on the CR. Congress needs to do its job and pass a conservative budget! CR’s are code for Continued Rubberstamp of fraud, waste, and abuse,” Gonzales posted on X.\n\nNebraska moderate GOP Rep. Don Bacon raised concern about a clean measure since military funding would be held flat.\n\n“A continuing resolution (CR) is bad for our military and weakens our national security. A CR means new weapons programs cannot get started.

Tierney L Cross/Reuters\n\nIn a post on X, McMahon said she intended to \"make good\" on President Donald Trump's promises to make U.S. education the best in the world, return education to the states and free students from bureaucracy through school choice.\n\nMcMahon, who previously served as the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term, will be tasked with shutting down the federal agency she was confirmed to lead.\n\nAt a White House event last month, Trump said, “I told Linda, ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job. I want her to put herself out of a job, Education Department.”\n\n“I want the states to run schools, and I want Linda to put herself out of a job,” Trump added.\n\nSources told ABC News the president is expected to sign an executive order as soon as this week calling for McMahon to diminish the education department and work with Congress to pass legislation that would eliminate it. The move would fulfill Trump’s campaign promise of returning education back to the states.\n\nHowever, Trump’s directive will not stand without congressional approval, according to experts who’ve spoken to ABC News. Any proposed legislation would likely fail without 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nThe Trump loyalist and donor acknowledged she needed Congress to carry out the president’s vision.\n\n“We'd like to do this right,” McMahon said during her February confirmation hearing, adding, “that certainly does require congressional action.”\n\nMcMahon, 76, earned her teaching certification from East Carolina University. She is a champion of apprenticeship and workforce training programs, school choice, and parental rights.\n\nMcMahon also had two stints serving on the Board of Trustees at Sacred Heart University, where she is currently the Treasurer. She served on the Connecticut State Board of Education in 2009.\n\nShe also co-founded World Wrestling Entertainment with her husband Vince McMahon.\n\nThe US Department of Education building is seen in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 13, 2025. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMcMahon allies believe the secretary will be an agent of change, a disrupter, and the dismantler that the Department of Education needs. Department skeptics also stress that the federal agency spends too much on education without adequate academic results.\n\nHouse Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Rep. Tim Walberg, who said he met with McMahon last week for roughly 30 minutes, celebrated her victory.\n\n“Secretary McMahon has demonstrated she is a fierce advocate for our youth,” Walberg said in a statement to ABC News. “Her leadership and experience both in education and business will help ensure we are setting our students up for successful futures.”\n\nAcross Capitol Hill, there was sobering reaction from opponents to the business executive and wrestling legend's confirmation.\n\n“I’m highly concerned that her interest in destroying the Department of Education will mean children with special needs will not be able to access individualized education plans, that our lower-income students will be able to afford college and higher education, and that our school districts will lose out on critical funding to meet the needs and well being of their students,” Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said after the vote.\n\nPublic education advocate Bernie Sanders, the ranking member of the Senate’s education committee, told ABC News that McMahon’s confirmation could be potentially devastating for Americans.\n\n“If you are a working-class person, if you are a low income person, the help that your community is now getting will likely be killed,” Sanders said.\n\nAnd critics labeled McMahon as a disastrous choice for the students and educators across the U.S. who rely on the statutorily authorized education programs, like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Title I funding for low-income families. Dozens of civil rights groups opposed McMahon’s confirmation, including the NAACP.\n\n“This is an agency we cannot afford to dismantle,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson wrote in a statement to ABC News.\n\n“Her confirmation brings us one step closer to losing our Department of Education -- the agency that not only funds public schools, but advocates for our teachers and enforces essential civil rights laws.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump's nominee for education secretary Linda McMahon arrives to testify at her nomination hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in Washington, Feb. 13, 2025.

McMahon said she is looking into moving the department's essential functions, like civil rights protections and its non-discrimination laws for students with disabilities, to other agencies.\n\n“Why do you think that it is better to stick the functions dealing with children with disabilities in a huge department that will not have the same priorities,” Sen. Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester asked during McMahon's confirmation hearing.\n\n“The bottom line is, because it's not working,” McMahon said.\n\n“The Department of Education was set up in 1980 and since that time, we have spent almost a trillion dollars. We have watched our performance scores continue to go down. I do believe that it is a responsibility to make sure that our children have equal access to excellent education. I think that is best handled at the state level,” she added.",

Elissa Slotkin speaks during a hearing at the Capitol in Washington, DC, Jan. 14, 2025. Ben Curtis/AP\n\nShe is also expected to take on Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government. Democrats have invited a number of fired federal workers as their guests for the speech.\n\nSlotkin's guest will be Andrew Lennox, who served as a Marine in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria and was fired from his job with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\n\"You spend 10 years trying to defend your country in terms of honesty, integrity, and justice and then you come back and get copy and pasted the same email as 10,000 other people about performance,\" Lennox told ABC News.\n\nSlotkin's speech comes as Democrats look to collect themselves after a punishing 2024 campaign cycle that saw Trump handily defeat then-Vice President Kamala Harris' bid for the White House. Democrats didn't fare much better down ballot, losing control of the Senate and failing to recapture the House.\n\nAs Democratic leadership tries to zero in on a new strategy to reach moderate voters, they're looking to beam the spotlight onto Slotkin, who pulled off a narrow win in purple Michigan this November, beating Republican nominee Mike Rogers, who had served seven terms in the House, in a race for the state's open Senate seat, even as Trump won Michigan by 80,000 votes.\n\nHer focus on reproductive rights and economic issues like lowering costs for families, coupled with her track record in the House, helped her eke out a narrow victory in the Senate race. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took notice in selecting her to deliver the Democrats' response.\n\nSchumer called Slotkin a \"rising star\" of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"As you know, Elissa is a rising star in our party. The American people are going to love what she has to say. She's just great -- on both economic and national security. I'm excited, I think we're all excited,\" Schumer said following the formal announcement that Slotkin would deliver the response to Trump.\n\nSlotkin is a former CIA agent who worked as a Middle East analyst. She served three tours in Iraq in this role. She then worked at the White House and Pentagon during the Bush and Obama administrations before launching a bid for the House.\n\nShe won her seat in the House of Representatives in 2018, ousting a two-term GOP incumbent. During her tenure, she flexed her national security bona fides, serving on the Armed Services, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs committee.\n\nDuring her time in the House, Slotkin was consistently ranked among the most bipartisan members of the chamber. She occasionally voted across party lines and, in her earliest votes in the Senate, demonstrated a willingness to continue that bipartisan streak. She was one of 12 Democrats who voted in favor of the Republican-led Laken Riley Act earlier this year, helping to send the bill to Trump's desk.",

        "content": "The U.S. Cyber Command is pausing its offensive operations against Russia\n\nBy LOLITA C. BALDOR Associated Press and DAVID KLEPPER Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has paused offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command, rolling back some efforts to contend with a key adversary even as national security experts call for the U.S. to expand those capabilities.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations, on Monday confirmed the pause.\n\nHegseth’s decision does not affect cyberoperations conducted by other agencies, including the CIA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. But the Trump administration also has rolled back other efforts at the FBI and other agencies related to countering digital and cyber threats.\n\nThe Pentagon decision, which was first reported by The Record, comes as many national security and cybersecurity experts have urged greater investments in cyber defense and offense, particularly as China and Russia have sought to interfere with the nation's economy, elections and security.\n\nRepublican lawmakers and national security experts have all called for a greater offensive posture. During his Senate confirmation hearing this year, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said America’s rivals have shown that they believe cyberespionage — retrieving sensitive information and disrupting American business and infrastructure — to be an essential weapon of the modern arsenal.\n\n“I want us to have all of the tools necessary to go on offense against our adversaries in the cyber community,” Ratcliffe said.\n\nCyber Command oversees and coordinates the Pentagon’s cybersecurity work and is known as America’s first line of defense in cyberspace. It also plans offensive cyberoperations for potential use against adversaries.\n\nHegseth’s directive arrived before Friday’s dustup between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. It wasn’t clear if the pause was tied to any negotiating tactic by the Trump administration to push Moscow into a peace deal with Ukraine.\n\nTrump has vowed to end the war that began when Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, and on Monday he slammed Zelenskyy for suggesting the end to the conflict was “far away.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions about Hegseth's order.\n\nCyber warfare is cheaper than traditional military force, can be carried out covertly and doesn’t carry the same risk of escalation or retaliation, making it an increasingly popular tool for nations that want to contend with the U.S. but lack the traditional economic or military might, according to Snehal Antani, CEO of Horizon3.ai, a San Francisco-based cybersecurity firm founded by former national security officers.\n\nCyberespionage can allow adversaries to steal competitive secrets from American companies, obtain sensitive intelligence or disrupt supply chains or the systems that manage dams, water plants, traffic systems, private companies, governments and hospitals.\n\nThe internet has created new battlefields, too, as nations like Russia and China use disinformation and propaganda to undermine their opponents.\n\nArtificial intelligence now makes it easier and cheaper than ever for anyone — be it a foreign nation like Russia, China or North Korea or criminal networks — to step up their cybergame at scale, Antani said. Fixing code, translating disinformation or identifying network vulnerabilities once required a human — now AI can do much of it faster.\n\n“We are entering this era of cyber-enabled economic warfare that is at the nation-state level,” Antani said. “We’re in this really challenging era where offense is significantly better than defense, and it’s going to take a while for defense to catch up.”\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Pam Bondi also has disbanded an FBI task force focused on foreign influence campaigns, like those Russia used to target U.S. elections in the past. And more than a dozen people who worked on election security at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were put on leave.\n\nThese actions are leaving the U.S. vulnerable despite years of evidence that Russia is committed to continuing and expanding its cyber efforts, according to Liana Keesing, campaigns manager for technology reform at Issue One, a nonprofit that has studied technology’s impact on democracy.\n\n“Instead of confronting this threat, the Trump administration has actively taken steps to make it easier for the Kremlin to interfere in our electoral processes,” Keesing said.",

ABC News\n\nPyongyang has deployed more than 12,000 soldiers to Russia to fight in the Ukraine war, according to US estimates, with experts claiming Russian forces have also used North Korean weapons.\n\nAn estimated 300 North Korean soldiers have died in the fighting, and over 2,700 have been wounded, Seoul's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers in a closed briefing in January.\n\nSouth Korea's spy agency told journalists Thursday that an unknown number of additional North Korean soldiers have been sent to the frontlines in Russia's western Kursk region since early February, after a near month-long lull in fighting against Ukrainian troops, who launched a surprise offensive across the border last August.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced in January that his forces had captured two North Korean soldiers, marking the first time that Ukraine had captured Pyongyang's troops alive.\n\nABC News Foreign Correspondent Britt Clennett speaks with North Korean defectors Ryu Seong-hyeon and Pak Yusung in Seoul, South Korea. ABC News\n\nIn a nearly 3-minute video released by Ukraine following the capture of the two North Korean troops, one of the soldiers says he wants to remain in Ukraine when asked if he wishes to return home. The Korean translator asks, \"Did you know you were fighting in a war against Ukraine?\" The soldier shakes his head.\n\nSouth Korean intelligence assessed that the two soldiers were with the Reconnaissance General Bureau, a key North Korean military intelligence agency.\n\nAn undated handout photograph released on Jan. 11, 2025, from the Telegram account of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine shows an alledged soldier presented as North Korean detained by Ukrainian authorities at an undisclosed location in Ukraine.

ABC News\n\n\"Before they go they don't have any practice in how to defend against a drone or how to fight Ukrainians, that's why they just die like a dog,\" Ryu said. \"They don't have the skill, the language or the information.\"\n\nPak and Ryu's analysis lines up with information released by South Korean intelligence, which said North Korea has clearly instructed the soldiers to kill themselves to avoid being captured alive.\n\nSeoul's spy agency also said it attributes the \"massive casualties\" of North Korean soldiers to their \"lack of understanding of modern warfare,\" including their \"useless\" act of shooting at long-range drones, based on the agency's analysis of a recent combat video.\n\nABC News Foreign Correspondent Britt Clennett speaks with North Korean defectors Ryu Seong-hyeon and Pak Yusung in Seoul, South Korea. ABC News\n\nRyu, who was about 110 lbs. at the time of his defection, said if he were still a North Korean soldier, he would also want to go: \"If I went to Ukraine, I could eat food, and I could see another country.\" He said there are also big financial incentives, and the soldiers would have no idea that their chances of dying were so high.\n\nSelling lies\n\nRyu and Pak said North Korean soldiers were being sold a lie. \"From a young age they're told to hate the American 'wolves', and now they are told they are finally killing Americans,\" the defectors said.\n\nRyu said in his experience with the North Korean air force, about 50% of the pilots were only trained in theory, and did not have experience flying a fighter jet.\n\nPak, who is a researcher at the North Korea Institute, said North Korean leader Kim Jon Un would be receiving critical technology in exchange for the manpower, in what should be a deeply worrying sign for the world, Kim also gets more real combat experience in case of a war on the peninsula.\n\n\"If Russia wins the war, it will empower the dictator alliance,\" Pak said.\n\nABC News Foreign Correspondent Britt Clennett, right, speaks with North Korean defectors Ryu Seong-hyeon, center, and Pak Yusung in Seoul, South Korea. ABC News\n\n\"This is just the start. If the Ukraine war keeps going, Kim will keep sending soldiers. Inside North Korea more people will start knowing and that could be a threat to Kim.\"\n\nWhen asked what they could possibly do about it when living in a dictatorship controlled by fear, Pak said, \"Think about it: your sons died on the battlefield and not for your own country.\"\n\nRyu added, \"You cannot send so many people to the labor camps.\"\n\nPak and his team of four North Korean defectors, Voices of North Korean Youth, have been trying to push the international community to condemn Russia and North Korea with one voice, and also called for the International Criminal Court to hold North Korean leader Kim accountable.\n\nABC News' Karson Yiu contributed to this report.",

        "content": "The cause of last year’s deadly wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, has been revealed. The August 2023 blaze that left more than 100 people dead was caused by the re-energization of broken utility lines in Lahaina, according to an investigation released Wednesday by the Maui Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nThe fire has been classified as accidental. Per the report, the re-energization of the line caused sparks, which ignited overgrown vegetation at a surrounding utility pole. The overhead and energized power line fell to the ground, further igniting vegetation.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nInvestigators initially believed they had extinguished the fire, which started around 6:30 AM, but undetected smoldering material reignited the second phase of the fire hours later, just before 3 PM.\n\n“We want to make abundantly clear to Lahaina and to our Maui community that our firefighters went above and beyond their due diligence to be as confident as they could be that the fire was completely extinguished before they left the scene,” Assistant Chief Jeffrey Giesea said, per NBC News.\n\nAccording to the report, “Fed by extreme winds, the fire quickly grew out of control, jumped the bypass, and resulted in the subsequent conflagration from which our island community is still recovering.”\n\nThe fire destroyed over 2,000 structures and caused $6 billion in damages.\n\nThe report’s findings may or may not sway conspiracy theorists who believe the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes to turn Maui into a “smart island.”",

        "content": "A special court martial handed down a reprimand to an Army lieutenant colonel who was caught putting cameras in the dressing room of a clothing store by a 16-year-old girl. The Lt. Col., who fled from police when caught, pleaded guilty but will serve no jail time.\n\nThe slap on the wrist comes after civilian prosecutors initially attempted to pursue a criminal conviction. The Army convinced the court to let it handle the matter internally, however, and the officer was instead prosecuted through the Uniform Code of Military Justice. (UCMJ). Further, Motherboard found while seeking records related to the case that the court documents have since been sealed.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe case illustrates a disturbing trend where the Pentagon swoops in to protect its soldiers when they commit a crime. If convicted in a civilian court, Sweatland could have served up to a year in jail. Instead, a military judge issued a reprimand, an official black mark on Swetland’s military record.\n\nWhen asked if Sweatland would have to register as a sex offer, a representative for the U.S. Army Cadet Command told Motherboard it would comply with state law. “A court-martial convicted Lt. Col. Sweatland of a qualifying sex-related offense. The Army is complying with all sex-related offense processing requirements,” Maj. Dan Lessard, spokesman for U.S. Army Cadet Command, told Motherboard.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Lt. Col. Jacob Sweatland was the head of the Army’s Reserve Offcier’s Training Corps program at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. He was responsible for shaping a new generation of U.S. military officers. In September 2022, Sweatland left a key fob with a hidden camera in it at a PacSun in San Luis Obispo. A 16-year-old girl found the camera and turned it in, and the store called the cops.\n\nThe cops took a look at the camera and found it still contained images and video from other dressing rooms in the area. Sweatland later called the store asking if anyone had found his key fob. The clerk, who was working with police, told Sweatland that someone had found it and he could come and retrieve it. The cops were waiting at the scene.\n\nThe details of the case from San Luis Obispo court records which were publicly available at the time of Sweatland’s arrest but are now sealed as part of his plea deal. Pieces of the records still exist from local reporting over the past few years. According to the now-sealed court records, which said that Sweatland faced charges of resisting arrest and obstructing justice in addition to invasion of privacy, the Lt. Col. fled when he got to the store and saw the cops. The police eventually tracked Sweatland down and arrested him.\n\nMustang News, reporting based on court records that were available in 2023, said that Sweatland’s fob contained images from several locations including other retail establishments and the gym at the Cal Poly Rec center. The video was shot “from covert angles” and showed “women’s backsides as they [preformed] various exercises wearing shorts and tight fitting athletic wear.” At the time of his arrest, Sweatland was removed from his position at the University but wasn’t charged for the recordings because they were taken in a public area.\n\nAs the case against Sweatland moved forward last year, he and his lawyers did what they could to avoid civilian justice. Before the case was handed over to military prosecutors, Sweatland attempted to get it dismissed as a “Military Diversion.” In California, veterans and servicemembers can ask for courts to dismiss charges if the defendant is “suffering from sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her military service.”\n\nAccording to court records, Sweatland’s defense team claimed that he’d undergone intensive therapy since his arrest. Sweatland’s service was no joke, he deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Colombia and earned a Bronze Star and a Ranger Tab. He saw combat and it’s possible he’s suffering from service related PTSD. But the court of SLO wasn’t buying it.\n\n“The calculated and covert method in which Defendant repeatedly targeted vulnerable young women demonstrates little potential for rehabilitation in the Military Diversion Program,” court records filed by the prosecutors said.\n\nAfter his attempt at using the Military Diversion Program was thwarted, the Army stepped in.\n\n“When disposing of allegations of misconduct, the Army regularly coordinates with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and prosecution authorities. In July 2023, the San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office initiated contact with the Army and requested the Army prosecute this case,” Lessard said. “After careful consideration of the evidence and in consultation with the victim, the Army preferred court-martial charges against Lt. Col. Sweatland on July 13, 2023.”\n\nThe military conducted an investigation of its own and handed down the reprimand during a special court martial. “On Jan. 22, 2024, at a special court-martial convened at Fort Knox, Ky., Lt. Col. Jacob J. Sweatland was convicted by a military judge, pursuant to his pleas, of one specification of indecent visual recording and one specification of conduct unbecoming an officer in violation of Articles 120c and 133, UCMJ. The military judge sentenced the accused to be reprimanded. The sentence was consistent with the terms of a plea agreement,” Lessard told Motherboard.\n\nHe explained that a reprimand is a punitive public censure. “A reprimand reflects negatively on a soldier’s military record and negatively affects a soldier’s career,” Lessard said. Despite the black mark, Sweatland does still have a career. He is currently assigned to the 8th Brigade of U.S. Army Cadet Command and is serving in an administrative role away from cadets.”\n\nThe Sweatland case highlights a problem with civilian-military relations and the Pentagon writ large. This is a persistent problem in the Army. In 2017, a soldier at Fort Hood allegedly assaulted his wife and fired a gun as she fled their home. The Army kicked him out of the service but did not pursue a case against him. The same thing happened the same year in Alaska after a soldier was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow soldier.\n\nIn both cases, there was physical evidence of the crime and no prosecution. The soldiers were simply allowed to return to civilian life. The Pentagon often runs cover for its soldiers, which creates a separate system of justice for those who serve.\n\nMotherboard asked Cadet Command to respond to concerns that the Army’s handling of Sweatland would be viewed as a slap on the wrist. “A court-martial convicted and punished Lt. Col. Sweatland under adherence to the rules and procedures prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. We have no further comment on this matter while it is subject to appellate review,” Lessard said.\n\nUpdate 2/9: This article was updated with more information from U.S. Army Cadet Command spokesperson Maj. Dan Lessard and the subhed has been changed to reflect this information.",

        "content": "If you’re old enough to remember the DARE program, you probably remember the litany of unhinged rhetoric they used to try and convince you that smoking cannabis was not a good time and does not make you a cool dude. Among those was the claim that over time, cannabis makes you dumber and permanently damages your long term memory. Well, we can (maybe) put that one to bed along with the whole “gateway drug” thing. Because according to a study out of Denmark, cannabis users might actually experience less cognitive decline than non-cannabis users as they age.\n\nConscripted In Copenhagen\n\nA little background first: Ever since 1849, Denmark has required physically fit men over 18 years of age to be conscripted for 4-12 months of military service. On the way into this service, conscripts are given a cognitive test. That’s where the authors of this new study saw an opportunity. The test was re-administered to 5,162 men who were now around 64 years old, and then polled those men to see if they’d ever tried or habitually consumed cannabis.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe men who were habitual consumers of the devil’s lettuce actually scored higher on the cognitive test than those who didn’t, showing less overall cognitive decline over the around 44 year period between the first time they took the cognitive test and the re-test for this study. There are a lot of other factors that could play a role in these results, like lifestyle, income, and consumption of other intoxicants over time. But even accounting for those, the researchers still saw a slight uptick in cognitive function among the old stoner crowd.\n\nNot so fast, Grandpa\n\nThere’s a caveat, though. The margin is slim: cannabis consumers scored on average 1.3 points higher than non-cannabis users. Even the authors of the study say that much more research is needed before any medical conclusions can be drawn. Still, it’s an interesting result that flies in the face of conventional wisdom about cannabis. So don’t go getting your grandpa a bag of weed and a bong for Christmas just yet. Or do, just don’t expect that it’ll make him any better at, well, anything besides eating and saying inappropriate things at the dinner table.",

        "content": "More infants died in the U.S. after Roe V. Wade was overturned.\n\nEarlier this year, a Texas study found increased infant mortality rates in the 18 months after the state’s six-week abortion ban went into effect in 2021.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe latest study, which was penned by Parvati Singh and Dr. Maria Gallo and published in JAMA Pediatrics, built on that research. It took a look at infant mortality nationwide after Roe V. Wade was overturned in 2022.\n\nThe study found that infant mortality was up to seven percent higher than normal in certain months, which is equivalent to an average of 247 more deaths.\n\nThe jump was most pronounced—a 10 percent rise—among infants with congenital anomalies. That is likely due to more frail fetuses being carried to term amid abortion restrictions, the study suggested.\n\n“I’m not sure that people expected infant mortality rates to increase following Dobbs. It’s not necessarily what people were thinking about,” Gallo told Ohio State News. “But when you restrict access to health care it can cause a broader impact on public health than can be foreseen.”\n\nSingh agreed, telling CNN that the research “is evidence of a national ripple effect, regardless of state-level status.”\n\n“This is the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “Mortality is the ultimate outcome of any health condition. This is a very, very acute indicator. It could be representative of underlying morbidity and underlying hardship.”\n\nSingh told the first outlet that she now wants to explore maternal and infant mortality rates among various populations.\n\n“There’s a broader human toll to consider,” she said, “including mental health consequences of being denied abortion care or being forced to carry a fetus with a fatal genetic abnormality to term.”",

        "content": "Eva Walker hosts the Early Show on KEXP 90.3 FM in Seattle (the station broadcasts 92.7 FM in the Bay Area, too). She’s also the frontwoman for the Pacific Northwest rock band The Black Tones with her twin brother, Cedric Walker, and the author of this spider-based family coloring book. What can’t she do?\n\nWe caught up with Walker to talk about her top 10 favorite indie rock songs right now. While KEXP is known as the preeminent indie rock station, it’s she who gets first crack at audiences in the morning (her show is from 5 to 7 a.m. local time). So, it’s often her voice that gets to help select what’s hittin’ on a given day.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nLet’s check out her playlist and the reasons behind her picks below.\n\n“Southern Life (What It Must Be Like)” by Sharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory\n\nThis song’s sound is really big and it inspires me to write my own music—even to get out of my own comfort zone as a rock & roll musician.\n\nPlay video\n\n“Defense” by Panda Bear\n\nThis whole song is, like, two chords. It’s just a great example of minimalism as far as writing. It’s all about the groove, and that’s secretly my favorite thing about a good rock tune.\n\nPlay video\n\n“The Everlasting Gobstopper” by the Veldt\n\nThis is another song that doesn’t change too much as it’s going. But I just love the drive of this song. It makes me want to skydive!\n\nPlay video\n\n“Don’t Ever Meet Your Hero” by World News\n\nThis track reminds me of a song from, like, the 1980s. But they’re not a throwback act. So, I like how they’ve kind of on the sly brought back this great new wave sound.\n\nPlay video\n\n“Mudglimmer” by the Slaps\n\nThis is dark and folky, which I love. There’s a touch of 1990s alternative to the sound, which makes me feel happily nostalgic for my past.\n\nPlay video\n\n“Purgatory” by the Mystery Lights\n\nThe Mystery Lights freaking just rock. They’re like psychedelic late-60s-style, which is some of my favorite music. Also, with a title like “Purgatory” really gets my brain juices going!\n\nPlay video\n\n“Lost in Space” by Reuben Vaun Smith\n\nThis is like a space disco. It’s also a big of a lounge-like feeling. I feel like I’m in a waiting room and all I want to do is dance, which is one of my favorite feelings. I love songs about space.\n\nPlay video\n\n“Change the Channel” by Clipping\n\nThis song is just frenetic and in your face that it reminds me of having insomnia because the TV channels in my brain keep flipping and never turn off. That’s a feeling I know all too well!\n\nPlay video\n\n“Dangerous” by Asterhouse\n\nI love this Seattle band. The falsetto vocals here hearken to a genre or period of time in music that I could live in forever. It’s like new wave soul, even though Asterhouse is most definitely a rock band.\n\nPlay video\n\n“Stars & Sea” by Weep Wave\n\nAm I awake? Or am I dreaming? Or am I having a propellant nightmare? Either way, I’m invested. This track makes me feel like I should be running through a field or racing down a highway at top speed.",

        "content": "A California prison is being placed under a microscope following a possible death by mail. The incident in question involves fentanyl-laced pages that may have killed a mailroom supervisor.\n\nAt the high-security US Penitentiary in Atwater, an inmate named Jamar Jones was allegedly sent mail from his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ferreira and a man called Jersey Rudd III. Prosecutors say that multiple pages of the letter were “soaked” in drugs—including amphetamines, fentanyl, and “spice,” or synthetic cannabinoids, according to drug testing. They say the paper looked like it was dipped in wax.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe senders attempted to conceal the alleged drug shipment by sending it via “legal mail,” meant to be confidentially between an attorney and inmate. All three have been charged for conspiracy to distribute.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, the mailroom supervisor, Marc Fischer, came in contact with the envelope and handled its pages. Within five minutes, he began stumbling around and told coworkers he was “having trouble breathing.” Fellow corrections officers called for medical support, and after two hours and a trip to the hospital, Fischer died.\n\nThe cause of death is still unknown and won’t be identified until toxicology reports are finalized. Secondhand fentanyl exposure shouldn’t be fatal, experts say.\n\nThis is hardly the first case of drug-soaked mail in prisons. In 2019, 122 federal prisons began photocopying inmate letters instead of giving them the originals in an attempt to stop the distribution of any drug concealed in mail or postage. A bill to mandate digital mail-scanning in prisons passed the Senate last year, but it stalled in the House.",

        "content": "You have to respect someone who knows what they love and isn’t afraid to make it known. President Donald Trump has an affinity for Diet Coke—yes, you read that right—and it’s an affinity that’s so strong he built a damn button on the Oval Office desk to notify White House staffers to fill his cup up.\n\nNow, this is technically not a new thing. When he first took office in 2017 through 2021, he installed a red button—I’m imagining it looks like the ‘That Was Easy’ Staples’ button—on the desk. With him returning to the office this week, he didn’t waste any time in bringing the button back. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that the contraption was quickly set up in the office Monday, meaning it was a part of his extensive Day 1 activities in the office.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAgain, I have to say you have to appreciate someone so committed to what they love. Now I’m just wondering to myself what I would install a button for. One for Michelob Ultra refills? Or a button that brings me soft pretzels whenever my heart desires? The opportunities are endless.\n\nDonald Trump’s Diet Coke Button is Back in Washington\n\nThe Coca-Cola company is well aware of Trump’s fandom of its beverages. They even gave him a commemorative bottle recently with an old-school soda bottle and a White House label on it that listed his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. It was presented to him by the company’s CEO, James Quince.\n\nDuring his first term, the New York Times revealed just how obsessed he is with Diet Coke. Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans a day. There’s no way that’s healthy, right? I drink one of them, and I instantly hate myself for consuming the sugary drink.\n\nMore power to you, Trump. By this point, his body has gotta be comprised of 75% Diet Coke flowing through him.",

        "content": "Another day, another creative— though failed—attempt at smuggling drugs. Colombian officials at Rafael Nunez International Airport were in for a surprise when they discovered someone attempting to get one by them through a disguise. A man was departing on an Amsterdam flight when he was footsteps away from stepping onto his plane when authorities pulled him aside because they were suspicious of… his hair.\n\nExcept it wasn’t his hair, it was a wig. While he made it through the security checkpoints and presumably thought he was in the clear, the 40-year-old dealer was monitored leading up to the boarding process. Eventually, the suspicion grew to a point where they had to step in and investigate what they suspected was a unique smuggling vessel.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nA Drug Dealer Tried to Conceal Cocaine in His Wig—And Failed\n\nPhotos from the scene showed the man’s wig being cut into and beneath it was nine cocaine capsules, according to TMZ. The black wig was able to conceal them initially before the security scanner uncovered the secret.\n\nWhen the wig was fully cut off, it showed the pods engrained in the inner part of the wig. I can’t imagine it was comfortable at all, but it nearly worked. Props to security for suspecting that something was off about the hairdo. The BBC reports that the street value of the drugs, which weighed in at 220 grams, would have equated to $10,450 U.S. dollars.\n\nColumbia is known to be the most prevalent cocaine exporter in the country, so it’s no wonder that airport security has its guard up for anything that seems out of place. Clearly, the wig set off enough alarms with officials that they tracked him throughout the airport before concluding that they needed to intervene before he headed to Amsterdam.\n\nIt’s been a busy month for wild drug dealing stories. The wig-concealing-cocaine tactic is the most interesting, but perhaps the most intricate was what came out of the Morocco and Spain border. That’s where a drug smuggling tunnel was discovered, connecting the two countries between the only land border.",

She starred at Cornell University, where she was a team captain and hit the 100-point mark for the University.\n\nShe turned pro and spent time with the Calgary Inferno before playing internationally in Sweden.\n\nAfter her playing days, she was a trailblazer in the American Hockey League as the first female coach with the Kraken’s minor league team, the Coachella Valley Firebuds. She was there from 2022 to 2024 before moving to the NHL.\n\nHow Many Women Coach in other leagues?\n\nWhile Campbell broke down the walls at the NHL level, the other three major leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA) have already done so.\n\nAt the start of the 2024 season, 15 women held full-time coaching positions in the NFL.\n\nIn 2023, MLB had 43 women coaching.\n\nBecky Hammon was the first woman to serve as an acting head coach, with the San Antonio Spurs in 2020.

Cole on Future and Metro Boomin’s song “Like That.” After J. Cole bowed out of the beef, Kendrick and Drake began trading shots back and forth over several diss tracks, one of which was the song “Not Like Us.”\n\nThe track went on to be one of the biggest songs of 2024 and won every single award it was nominated for at the 2025 Grammy Awards and was performed by Kendrick during the Super Bowl Halftime Show in February.

        "content": "Does the time of the month that a baby is conceived affect if it’s a boy or a girl?\n\nIt’s possible, says British mathematician Hannah Fry.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“The chances of a woman conceiving a male or female child actually very subtly changes depending on when in her cycle she conceives,” Fry explained in a video on her Instagram page. “So slightly earlier, ever so slightly more likely that she’ll have a baby boy.”\n\nHowever, Fry said the odds are “way too small” for couples to use that as a predictor.\n\nThe larger point of her investigation was analyzing gender trends over time. With data focusing on England and Wales, she explored something called the “returning soldier effect,” which shows spikes in male birth rates following World War I and II.\n\nThe trend, which has also been observed in other countries, has several possible explanations.\n\nOne controversial theory is that healthier soldiers are more likely to survive war and come home. That, combined with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis —which posits that healthier people are more likely to conceive boys—could explain the spike.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the increase in male births is nature’s way of compensating for the loss of life during the war.\n\nThe ‘returning soldier effect’ is just one possible explanation for birth rate trends\n\nFry admits that there’s no way to tell for certain what causes more male births than female, or vice versa. There are also dozens, if not hundreds, of other factors that come into play, including the health of the mothers and environmental conditions.\n\nFor example, writing in 2008, William H. James observed a decline in male birth rates in Iran during and following the Iran-Iraq war. He attributed the fall to “psychological stress causing pregnant women disproportionately to abort male fetuses.”\n\nHowever, the “returning soldier effect” definitely has a basis in fact.\n\n“At the end of a war, everyone has much more sex than normal,” Fry noted. “Women get pregnant slightly earlier in their cycles, and as a result, there is a spike in the number of baby boys that are born.”",

        "content": "Masked men recently proved the ongoing presence of anti-semites in America. During a performance of The Diary of Anne Frank in Michigan, a group of men holed up in front of the venue, waving Nazi flags and spewing slurs.\n\nThe Fowlerville Community Theatre was hosting the play at American Legion Devereaux Post 141 when they became aware of “the presence of self-identified Nazi protesters,” according to a press release.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nBobby Brite, past commander of the legion, recorded a video of the protestors and shared it to Facebook. He told The Detroit News that the group of 10 masked men chanted things including “Anne Frank was a whore” during their anti-semitic showing. Frank was 15 when she died at a concentration camp in 1945.\n\n“They are some of the most cowardly people I’ve ever met,” Brite told the outlet of the “absolutely disgusting” protest.\n\n“There was a group of people at the four-way intersection in downtown that had swastika flags and American flags,” Alex Sutfill, a witness, told the local CBS station. “They were sticking their arms up and yelling ‘Hail Hitler‘ and ‘Hail Trump’ and everything like that.”\n\nHow the Protest Was Handled\n\nThe theater group alerted the American Legion staff on duty of the situation and was assured they were already aware of and monitoring the men, who moved out of the legion’s parking lot when asked.\n\nAfterwards, the demonstrators went “across the street and waved flags adorned with Nazi insignia,” the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office told The Detroit News. “A subject then approached them, and an argument ensued.”\n\nPeter Damerow told the local CBS station that he was the one who confronted the group. In response, he claimed, “They looked at me and one of them said, ‘No this is Pureville now, and we’re here to make sure it stays pure.’”\n\n“Nothing physical transpired and ultimately the parties involved separated,” the sheriff’s office said.\n\nStill, “out of an abundance of caution,” the group alerted the audience members to the situation at intermission.\n\n“For this production, our cast was also on stage in character during intermission, which was when they found out as well,” the press release read. “Although some were understandably shaken, they pulled together and finished the performance with strength and professionalism.”\n\nHow the Situation Mirrors History\n\nChuck Firman, president of the Fowlerville Community Theatre, added in a statement to the The Detroit News, “It was a scary moment. But really, the show must go on.”\n\nThe theater’s press release further noted how the ordeal, which ended when the protestors left before the end of the show, “gave us a small glimpse of the fear and uncertainty felt by those in hiding.”\n\nIndeed, Brite told the local ABC station, “We had 75 people downstairs that watched that play and out of that 75, there were 50 or 60 of them that were afraid to leave this building. We had to escort them to their cars. No one in America should feel like that.”\n\n“As a theatre, we want to make people feel and think,” the press release read. “We hope that by presenting Anne’s story, we can help prevent the atrocities of the past from happening again.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League’s Michigan outpost said In a statement, “disgusted by the far-right extremists who praised Hitler and waved Nazi flags” at the event.\n\nIn October, the organization found that, following Hamas’ October 2023 attack on Israel, there were 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. That’s a 200 percent increase from the previous year.",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "A group of Canadian firefighters are feeling the heat after their ill-fated Halloween bash. During the North Sydney Firefighters Club’s Halloween dance, a group of four people dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan joined in on the festivities.\n\nIn video obtained by CBC News, four people are seen entering the Nova Scotia party wearing white robes and pointed hoods. One person in the racist outfit was carrying a makeshift cross.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nIn a statement to Global News, Fire Chief Lloyd MacIntosh said the people in Ku Klux Klan costumes were admitted by volunteers working the door.\n\n“A mistake was made,” he admitted. “They were allowed in, they shouldn’t have been.”\n\nVolunteers asked the people to remove their hoods, but some refused, MacIntosh said. He added that a volunteer took away the cross one person was carrying.\n\nFirefighters Speak Out About the Racist Costume\n\nIn a statement posted to Facebook, the club admitted that it “made a mistake!”\n\n“We apologize to any and all of our community who were offended or hurt by our lack of actions,” the post read. “These four individuals are in no way, shape or form associated with our organization. We promise to be better in the future.”\n\nWade Gouthro, the Deputy Fire Chief, also spoke out about the controversy in a Facebook post.\n\n“I can honestly tell you that the situation at the North Sydney Firefighters club is not who we are or what we stand for,” Gouthro wrote, before admitting that he’d been “very reluctant” to address the situation due to fear of adding “fuel to the fire.”\n\n“I can tell you this, the members of North Sydney and myself are very sorry from the bottom of our hearts and we ask for your forgiveness,” he continued. “We would certainly never intentionally hurt or insult anyone regardless of race, color, orientation or religion. We spend all of our time trying to do right by the community and are here to do all we can for anyone.”\n\nGouthro added that being “referred to as racists hurts bad.”\n\nWhy KKK-Dressed Attendees Were Admitted to the Party\n\nWhile Gouthro was not working the party in question, he noted that he’s worked the annual event many times in the past.\n\n“When we have Halloween dances you never know what you are going to see come through the door,” he wrote. “Most times we think, ‘Ah it is a costume’ without really thinking of the big picture or the past it represents.”\n\n“So when you folks comment that they shouldn’t have gotten in and that we need to do better, you are right, and we will,” Gouthro continued. “… I will assure you that we are all hurting in our hearts today that we have disappointed a community that we work so hard to make better and protect.”\n\nHe concluded his post by “once again apologizing on behalf of myself and our membership and also a sincere promise to do better in the future.”",

        "title": "The Dark Dreams of Curtis Yarvin, Trump 2.0’s Big Tech Preachertroll",
        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "This is a members-only article from the forthcoming comeback issue of VICE Magazine. To subscribe, visit our membership section—not only will you get four issues of the printed magazine each year, delivered to your door, you’ll also have exclusive early access to our best new documentaries and online content, as well as a raft of members’ perks.\n\nAt the outset of the year, Curtis Yarvin—the blogger whose vision of a new, autocratic U.S. is reportedly gaining traction within the Trump administration—leapt back into the mainstream spotlight, with a New York Times interview headlined: “Curtis Yarvin Says Democracy Is Done. Powerful Conservatives Are Listening.” The article was accompanied by a moody monochromatic portrait that exaggerates Yarvin’s jowls like a veristic bust. One animated version of the photo shows Yarvin ominously drumming his fingers on a table. The implication seems clear: Do those restless fingertips contain the fate of the nation?\n\nIncreasingly, Yarvin has been touted by the media as a key to understanding the American New Right—a Steve Bannonesque figurehead, but for its tech faction rather than its nativist-populist one. He’s a computer engineer who’s been blogging away for decades in the strange world of online ‘neoreaction’ under the dusty fairytale pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug,” and is best known for his idea that American democracy should be replaced by a monarchy that runs the country like a start-up and grants generous privileges to the tech-industrialist elites.\n\nThis has won Yarvin friends in high places. His relationship with billionaire venture capitalist mega-donor Peter Thiel is well publicized. Marc Andreessen and J.D. Vance have cited his work approvingly. Now, with Trump settling back into the White House and indebted to the Bay Area robber barons that helped put him there, it feels as though Yarvin’s public profile has decisively shifted—from geeky fringe blogger to a political-philosopher éminence grise who is laying the discursive groundwork for an “American Caesar.”\n\nClearly, this is how Yarvin wants to be perceived. But take him at face value, and you’re playing a losing game. You’re not going to find a Schmitt or a Machiavelli here, and the joke’s on you for expecting that. Instead, Yarvin is best understood as a kind of spokesperson for ten million brain-fried Twitter anons, a cohort he’s described as the “new public intellectuals” of our “digital age,” and whose scattershot, stream-of-consciousness tub-thumping is currently being reflected in some punchy U.S. government policy. Whether that’s down to Yarvin is hard to discern. It seems unlikely. Yet what’s undeniable is that he finds himself arriving into a cultural moment for which he feels precision-engineered. In Yarvin, Big Tech has found the perfect preachertroll to exalt the deliberate insanity of the ‘move fast and break things’ ethos it’s bringing to nation building, one who knows how to exploit “meme magic” to dream up new truths about the world. In times past, people would’ve called this ‘throwing lots of shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.’ Today, they call it disruption, hyperstition, accelerationism, the future.\n\nThis is why the whole thing makes more sense if you understand Yarvin as a Gen X tech geek playing the part of a poet-guru; someone who can help Silicon Valley sheath its scary, transhumanist vision of the future in ancient mysticism and boomer cool. Look: he’s trying to be Gabriele D’Annunzio in a leather jacket. He’s trying to harness the infinite sexuality of the poète maudit. He wants us to understand that he’s a prophet who has visions; that with his musings on the nature of elves, he’s somehow hallucinating the polity of the future. His swagger is a bit awkward. He’s a socialite who attracts a following of eccentrics. Some people have told me that it’s Yarvin who was responsible for redpilling a lot of the Silicon Valley fat cats, persuading them to indulge their god complexes, insisting that it’s actually chic to openly flirt with immiserating elites and outmoded racial theories, as a way of priming them to support Trump and whoever comes next.\n\nPlay video\n\nIn his interview with the NY Times, Yarvin displays some of the shifty mannerisms you might expect of a contrarian online troll, an identity that to his credit he has partly owned. His habit of peppering italics through his writing is a way of signposting profundity where more often than not, there isn’t any. If you were to lay out his political program in his own style, it could be abridged such: America needs to stop edging and gooning and elect a bareback President, one who is given free rein to be orders of magnitude more powerful. Sounds delectably depraved, doesn’t it? And yet what he really means by that is none other than FDR— ‘And you libs like FDR, don’t you?’ he snickers. The fans are in on the joke but the outsiders tend to give up in frustration—there’s no ‘there’ there, they complain; it’s incoherent and contradictory, it’s childish, it’s a testament to the intellectual vacuity of fascism, there’s no way this sophist charlatan can have any real influence, and so on. Open the schools!\n\nOver the past few years I’ve had a bunch of funny encounters with Yarvin in New York, which he visits somewhat regularly, as if to make routine pilgrimage to the ancestral home of the Beat Generation. The first was a sunny summer day in 2022, at a meetup he had scheduled for his Substack subscribers in a park by the Hudson River. (He sometimes sends out newsletters advertising meetups in various cities; he once even put out a dating call to meet “someone of childbearing age.”) Dozens of Oxford shirt-wearing College Republicans surrounded the master, whose shoulder-length hair rested on his loose, half-buttoned saffron shirt that reminded me of the robes of Theravada monks. He stood in the grass and ruminated on Garibaldi. The disciples asked him questions like, “Who is the most overrated monarch in history?” The crowd was almost entirely male, and I remember some of the guys being disappointed, though not surprised, that no quirked-up cocquettecore girlies with bad politics were in attendance.\n\nLater, in the fall, I saw Yarvin debate the playwright Matthew Gasda on the Shakespeare authorship controversy at a smoky salon in Greenwich Village. If you’re not familiar with this ongoing argument, there’s an “Oxfordian” thesis that the 17th century aristocrat Edward de Vere was the true author of Shakespeare’s works, and that Shakespeare had actually just been De Vere’s rentboy. This was the position Yarvin was arguing; to him, there is simply no way that a lowly, common-born fellow like Shakespeare could ever have portrayed the machinations of aristocratic life so accurately. Gasda—a sort of earnest Belle and Sebastian conservative himself—was arguing the widely accepted “Stratfordian” position, and had studied all night so he was ready to defend the Bard’s honor. Yarvin’s approach was more flippant. “Suppose a corpus of witty, erudite academic novels, set in an unnamed Ivy League English department,” he posited, “is published under the name of an illiterate immigrant from Ghana, who sells sunglasses on a blanket on the street in Morningside Heights?”\n\nIt was a line that sounded familiar, because Yarvin had already published it in a blog on his Substack. Clearly, the Ghanaian immigrant analogy is his go-to line on this subject. In his closing arguments, he went on to suggest that De Vere couldn’t put his own name to his works of genius because he was part of an Elizabethan bohemia of poet-spies who ran psyops for the Queen. Whether the Oxfordian thesis is actually true isn’t so important to Yarvin. What is? Hyperstitioning alternate histories to sow disbelief in the institutions of liberal modernity, ideally in the flippant manner of a social media shitposter. And who better to lap up these myths than the chain-smoking Dimes Square beatniks in the audience?\n\n“The mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level”\n\nIn the following years, I’d run into Yarvin every now and then at salons in other downtown basements. Sometime around Christmas 2023 I went to a reading where the venue hosts, fearing antifa-Dadaist direct action, had hired a bouncer to ensure the poet’s safety. In his signature winter look of all-black jeans and leather jacket, he read works from favorites like W.H. Auden, Robert Lowell, and Robinson Jeffers, as well as some original writing. I found one poem of his—“War”—particularly striking, for how it tried to channel the Futurist ecstasy of combat though the experience of looking at your phone:\n\n“I spend too much time\n\nOn Twitter, following\n\nThe war—probably\n\nOn the wrong side—\n\nNothing is in me to care”\n\nFrom there, the speaker in Yarvin’s poem—presumably Yarvin himself—is mesmerized in a kaleidoscope of disinterested transhistorical enjoyment. The angel of history goonscrolls reality, which in 2025 is a titillating and contextless succession of thirst traps and snuff videos from the front. We learn that war is full of paradoxes—war is pointless but it’s also the only eternal thing in human existence, (“all else fades from the clays”); it’s cool as hell; it’s the worst thing ever; it’s all a big lie, but lies are cool (“The highest art is propaganda” begins another of Yarvin’s poems)—no, it’s peace that is fake; peace disappoints; peace is unsexy; it’s the opposite of love. Of course, this ode to war was probably written in comfortable conditions in Northern California, but the author knows what he’s playing at. The intense traumatic-erotic experience of industrial slaughter is the libidinal origin of fascism, and seems to be a model for Yarvin’s New Right ideology of the future. Yet crucially, the intensity is lacking; these horrors are something the poet and his audience can mostly only experience vicariously, through the internet.\n\nCURTIS YARVIN IN DEFIANT MOOD IN HIS BELOVED NYC. PHOTO BY NICK DOVE.\n\nWhat my experiences in New York tell me is that the mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America—even when intended as ridicule—is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level, validating the idea of his real proximity to power. Even as Trump seems to be attempting some version of the RAGE (Retire All Government Employees) plan that Yarvin has laid out in his blogs, the actual writing is less a guidebook of practical decisions for the American Caesar than a word soup of dazzling lies intended to chip away at the received wisdom of liberal modernity itself.\n\nCase in point: When Yarvin suggests that the wellbeing of Black Americans actually declined after slavery, he’s not interested in a good-faith historical argument. What he seeks to do is undermine the idea that All Men Are Created Equal. He certainly doesn’t need to convince Trump of that one, and it’s not like what Yarvin has to say will be of any direct help in the administration’s coming attempts to destroy the Civil Rights Act. It’s the nativist faction, the intra-administration rivals of Yarvin’s benefactors, who have that covered.\n\nYarvin has a much different function. His dream is to win over the lookers-on: the College Republicans, the Silicon Valley elites, and in New York’s bars and smoke-filled salons the clouted “cool kids” who will one day be in positions of media power great enough to help rewrite history—and maybe let Yarvin fulfill his destiny as the great prophet of a new age of illiteracy, tyranny, and digital psychedelia.\n\nFollow Michael Crumplar @mcrumps",

        "content": "The family and friends of Johan Floderus, a Swedish diplomat potentially facing the death penalty in Iran, have told VICE News he has endured a “horrible situation” during his 20-month-long detention in a notorious Tehran prison.\n\nFlorerus, a 33-year-old working with Afghan refugees in Iran on behalf of the EU was detained in April 2022 at Tehran’s airport as he was visiting on a holiday trip and then accused of spying for Iran’s foes, in particular, Israel. He was charged and tried for “corruption on earth,” or stymieing the cause of the Iranian revolution, in the Islamic Republic’s religious courts, a charge that can be punished with death. He is the latest victim of a repeating pattern in which foreign nationals are entangled in a legal ordeal in Iran in order for the country’s ruling mullahs to extort money or other goals from the West.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAfraid that quiet diplomacy wasn’t working, Floderus’s loved ones broke their silence in December last year and, on Thursday, went to Brussels to hold an event to raise awareness of his case with European officials.\n\nFloderus’s sister Ingrid told VICE News: “We are very close with Johan and always spoke on almost a daily basis. He is such a freedom-loving and stubborn person. Since his arrest, we have been only able to talk a few times. I can’t imagine how horrible the situation he is in, but he is still full of life and trying to stay strong.”\n\n“Johan is someone full of life and always had a curious soul, and he always traveled around the world and spoke Farsi, and he visited Iran multiple times, and worked there.”\n\nJohan Floderus in a sup\n\nIn Iran, all foreign nationals are closely monitored, and their movements must be approved by local authorities. Despite repeated calls from both the EU and Sweden to release Floderus, the Iranian judiciary has insisted that they have enough evidence to prosecute him on espionage charges.\n\nThe Swede is held in Tehran’s Evin prison and his case is being handled by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran, headed by the clerical judge, Iman Afshari, already notorious for his passing unjust prison sentences on political activists, artists, and women.\n\nLast Sunday, the court concluded Floderus’s hearing after five sessions in an almost-empty courtroom, which the Swedish man attended in a prison uniform with his state-appointed lawyer and translator. Mizan News, the Iranian judiciary’s official outlet, reported that the prosecutors accused Floderus of a “very extensive intelligence cooperation with the Zionist occupation regime,” and said that his travel history was clear evidence of his involvement in activities that “threaten Iran’s national security”.\n\nAfshari gave a week for Floderus’ lawyer to submit their defense, and did not give a verdict date.\n\nWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nDespite denials from the Iranian government, rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly accused the Islamic Republic of “hostage diplomacy” by using trumped-up charges such as “corruption on earth” to extract political concessions, release funds held abroad by international sanctions, or in prisoner exchanges.\n\nFloderus’s arrest is likely to put pressure on Sweden in the case of the arrest of Iranian former prison official Hamid Nouri.\n\nNouri was detained upon arrival at Stockholm Airport in November 2019, and later charged with involvement in the killing of thousands of Iranian political prisoners in 1988.\n\nJohan and his sister Ingrid.\n\nThe former prison official was sentenced to life “for grave breaches of international humanitarian law and murder,” by a Swedish court after the prosecution asked for the maximum penalty in July 2022. The outcome was hailed as a rare human rights success against Iranian regime officials, but outraged the government in Tehran, which called the case “politically motivated.”\n\nLast Sunday, the Iranian prosecutor asked for the maximum penalty in Floderus’s case – either life in prison or the death sentence given the “important nature and adverse affects of the accused’s actions.”\n\nThe diplomat’s family had kept quiet about the arrest on the advice of the Swedish authorities as they tried to resolve the issue through “silent diplomacy,” and launched a public campaign after the news broke out at the end of last year, and losing hope that Floderus would be released through back-channel talks.\n\n“Other governments go the distance to protect their citizens, and I hope that Sweden will do that too. Johan is my brother, and his freedom and well-being are the most important thing in the world. So of course I feel that you should use every tool in the toolbox,” said his sister, Ingrid.\n\nEmily Atkinson, a close friend of Floderus, said: “Johan is someone who always brings people together. We have been left with a massive gap in our life without him, and we are also being taken hostage by the appalling situation,” she said as she struggled to keep back tears during a conversation with VICE News\n\n“I want to say: Johan, hold on. We’re here for you. We’ve rallied for you. We’re speaking up for you, and we’re here waiting for you. Hold on and stay strong.”",

        "content": "President Donald Trump utilized his first day back in office to put a handful of executive orders in motion, one of which was announcing the United States’ withdrawal from the WHO, the World Health Organization.\n\nThis wasn’t exactly a surprising move, considering Trump’s history with the organization. He attempted to remove the U.S. from the WHO in 2020 before Joe Biden overturned the decision and resumed funding for the organization. One of Trump’s major running points during his campaign was keeping American dollars in-house and not paying for what he perceived to be a waste of funds, which always meant the WHO was in jeopardy.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nTrump cited the organization’s “mishandling” of the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the decision.\n\nDonald Trump Pulls The United States Out of the WHO\n\nAbove all else, it’s the money the country has invested in the WHO that ultimately fueled the decision. America has been the WHO’s largest donor since its inception in 1948. The country has routinely given around $163 million in yearly contributions, with that number going as high as over $800 million at times. There are up to 194 countries involved in the WHO, with America providing up to a fifth of the organization’s funding, per USA Today.\n\n“Everybody rips off the United States and that’s it—it’s not going to happen anymore,” Trump said on Monday during a press conference.\n\nWithout the United States providing funding, the WHO will now likely lean on China, which has typically been the next largest provider. The order signed by Trump on Monday specifically mentions the population size of China and the fact that, despite it being far larger than The States’, the country pays less than 90% of what America does to the WHO.\n\nJapan, Germany, and the United Kingdom have rounded out the top five contributing countries over the years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has yet to comment on Monday’s order.",

        "content": "You never know what you’ll get when you open up OnlyFans. Okay, maybe you have some sort of idea. But would you ever expect to go on there and find an account that is solely there to educate you on its razor products?\n\nThat’s what the company Nimbi and its co-founder, Anna Reid, are doing as one of the few companies that have dipped its toes into the marketing potential within the platform. The reason that Reid decided to venture into that space is exactly why a place like OnlyFans could end up being a place for edgy companies who don’t want to deal with posts being flagged on other social media platforms.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nReid had been using TikTok for much of the brand’s advertising but kept noticing posts weren’t being made available to as many people as she expected. She tells Inc. that apparently “razor” is a banned word on the platform.\n\nYou can imagine that a shaving company would have some difficult marketing its products there when its biggest keyword is shadow-banned.\n\nWhy Does This Shaving Company Have an OnlyFans?\n\nSo she turned to the no-frills platform that certainly wasn’t going to limit the use of the word “razor.” Now she operates an OnlyFans page that is still in its infancy but growing as the brand dives more into the capabilities of the site.\n\nThe all-female company calls it the “perfect medium to share shaving tips” to its target market of women. Anyone who visits the page won’t be inundated with the typical content you’d expect on OnlyFans, rather they’ll find educational techniques that Reid says “we just can’t show on social media.”\n\nShe tells the outlet they’re “having a lot of fun with it” and from the sounds of it, have only really scratched the surface. Reid admitted they were slower and more controlled when first sharing on the platform but have since begun to build out content geared around the brand’s voice. For example, one of their better posts involved a content creator sharing an intimate shaving tutorial.\n\nThe plastic-free disposable razor company has made a name for itself outside of its boundary-pushing marketing campaigns. The brand can be found in 900 Target stores, which was just announced by the company.\n\nI’ll admit that this is a clever use of the OnlyFans medium. Marketing on that platform isn’t something that every company now needs to look at, but in this particular case with this brand, it makes a ton of sense.\n\nBut let’s circle back to the word “razor” being flagged on TikTok… seriously?",

        "content": "Venus retrograde begins, bringing with it an air of unpredictability or volatility in matters of the heart or wallet. Judgment in these areas of life can become cloudy, likely due to the strong emotions we feel around our close relationships and financial resources. The potential for miscommunication and misunderstanding increases. Choose your words and actions carefully during this celestial period, stargazer. Venus retrograde is a time for guarding your heart and protecting what’s most valuable to you. Keep in mind that this protection might extend against yourself. More often than not, your reckless behavior disaffects you and you alone. How will your sign fare under this planetary shift?\n\nRead your horoscope for the week, and see what the stars have in store for your sign today.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAries: March 21 – April 19\n\nVenus shifts into its retrograde motion in your celestial domain, increasing its proximity to your daily life. Be careful not to give in to knee-jerk reactions, Aries. The stars warn against allowing your desire to be right, successful, or both supersede the important relationships in your life. If you burn every bridge around you, you’ll have nowhere to go.\n\nAries monthly horoscope\n\nTaurus: April 20 – May 20\n\nYour ruling planet shifts into its retrograde motion today. During this time, romantic relationships and financial situations can go rocky or unstable. This can be especially disconcerting for you and your love of stability and familiarity. Whatever you do, try not to make things even more unpredictable by letting your stubborn streak overrule your critical thinking. Being right isn’t always important.\n\nTaurus monthly horoscope\n\nDiscover what the stars reveal about your future – connect with expert astrologers on Keen.com Try 5 Minutes for $1\n\nGemini: May 21 – June 20\n\nThe conjunction of your ruling planet, Mercury, and Neptune as the former celestial body moves further into Aries. A favorable sextile between Mercury and Pluto in Aquarius illuminates a clear path forward. With Aries pushing you toward your goals and Aquarius offering the creative energy it takes to get there, the stars are truly aligning in your favor, Gemini.\n\nGemini monthly horoscope\n\nCancer: June 21 – July 22\n\nThe waxing crescent Moon forms a direct opposition to Haumea retrograde as it passes from Aries to Taurus. As this lunar phase encourages us to prepare for what’s ahead, Venus retrograde turns things topsy-turvy. Going with your original plan may no longer be an option, Cancer. Rather than waste your time fighting the inevitable, try focusing your energy on improvising.\n\nCancer monthly horoscope\n\nLeo: July 23 – August 22\n\nA coinciding sextile between the Sun and waxing crescent Moon and a square between the Sun and Jupiter suggest that progress on a major project or goal is beginning to stall. Try your best to avoid catastrophizing when this happens, Leo. Use this downtime to your advantage. Consider your progress thus far to better inform your next steps forward.\n\nLeo monthly horoscope\n\nVirgo: August 23 – September 22\n\nAs Mercury moves further from Neptune into Aries, your ruling planet also begins to form a positive sextile with Pluto in Aquarius. This easygoing alignment suggests a greater sense of purpose and a better idea of your next move. Trust your instincts today, Virgo. Indeed, a moment’s consideration can make a world of difference in the haze of Venus retrograde.\n\nVirgo monthly horoscope\n\nLibra: September 23 – October 22\n\nYour ruling planet, Venus, shifts into its retrograde period while maintaining its direct opposition to Makemake retrograde. With placements in Aries and your celestial domain, respectively, this is far and away the most tangible cosmic alignment in your forecast. Reckless behavior can sometimes feel so good that it can almost convince us it isn’t reckless. Don’t give in to that falsehood.\n\nLibra monthly horoscope\n\nDiscover what the stars reveal about your future – connect with expert astrologers on Keen.com Try 5 Minutes for $1\n\nScorpio: October 23 – November 21\n\nPluto begins to lock into a positive sextile with Mercury, offsetting some of the foggier consequences of the square between your ruling planet and Haumea retrograde. Major transformations are on the way, Scorpio. Communicative Mercury’s positive alignment with your ruling planet suggests a strong sense of self and confidence in your aspirations. Lean on this certainty when Venus retrograde starts rocking the boat.\n\nScorpio monthly horoscope\n\nSagittarius: November 22 – December 21\n\nThe ongoing sextile between your ruling planet, Jupiter, and Venus shifts slightly as the latter planet begins its retrograde period. When retrograde, Venus can turn romance rocky and tank financial investments. Acting against one’s best interest becomes more and more tempting until short-term, instant satisfaction is the only thing worth pursuing. The stars urge you to seek contentment somewhere deeper than that.\n\nSagittarius monthly horoscope\n\nCapricorn: December 22 – January 19\n\nVenus retrograde is bound to shake things up over the next several weeks. But fortunately, you have quite the cosmic stabilizer in your corner. A positive sextile between your ruling planet, Saturn, and Uranus encourages adaptability and innovative approaches to new challenges. Sometimes, the easiest way to weather a storm is to hunker down and find ways to endure its passing.\n\nCapricorn monthly horoscope\n\nAquarius: January 20 – February 18\n\nUranus and Saturn continue their sextile in Taurus and Pisces, which will become especially useful after Venus begins its retrograde shift today. This celestial period invites relationship miscommunication, reckless spending habits, and depletion of our mental and physical resources. With chaotic Uranus and disciplinarian Saturn working in tandem, compensating for these natural ebbs and flows will become easier. Everything passes, Aquarius.\n\nAquarius monthly horoscope\n\nPisces: February 19 – March 20\n\nTwo notable alignments dominate your forecast today, Pisces. The first is the tense square between the Sun and Jupiter under your sign and Gemini, and the second is the far more positive sextile between Saturn and Uranus. The latter alignment of chaos-prone Uranus and responsible Saturn suggests a resiliency through the unexpected and unwanted. You decide how to play your hand.\n\nPisces monthly horoscope\n\nWhen you buy through our links, we may earn an affiliate commission.",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "For ten years, the latest interviewee on Informer—our series amplifying the voices of insiders and whistleblowers—consulted as a health and safety officer for the petroleum giant Shell, dealing with the psychological fallout of its voracious global expansion.\n\nTheir job was to listen to thousands of oil and gas workers airing their concerns about the professional hazards and mental and physical toll of working on the frontlines for a company like Shell. Some days, the job meant hearing from contracted workers in the Global South complaining that they hadn’t been paid. Other times, it would be counseling those driven into a state of extreme mental disrepair by allegedly working 31 days straight to keep the pipeline running.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“There’d be times I would close my eyes to go to bed at night and I would just picture burning bodies bobbing around in a water that was on fire,” our Informer says at one point during the interview. “That was basically the nightmare they were talking about that could come true.”\n\nThink your job is stressful? In our Informer’s first week at Shell, the company had to deal with a spill that created an oil slick the size of Belgium just off the Nigerian coast.\n\nHeavy shit indeed. You can watch the film now at YouTube or in the player below.\n\nPlay video\n\nNow, here’s an interview about the interview, with VICE director Alexi Phillips.\n\nVICE: First of all, thanks for making this intensely depressing film for me to watch. I haven’t slept since.\n\nAlexi Phillips: No worries.\n\nHow did the Shell informer first get in touch?\n\nI can’t really disclose that.\n\nMost of what’s talked about is disconcerting. How does this stuff stay out of the news?\n\nMost of these spills happen in countries that don’t get much media attention. Every once in a while a massive event, like what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, makes the news but the fact that there are thousands of tiny spills every day is just seen as more of the status quo and not remarkable enough to be ‘breaking news.’\n\nI was assuming the dangers of oil production would primarily be posed to the environment, or to members of the public whose lands or waters are suddenly destroyed by a big spill. I wasn’t expecting to hear that people actually working for these companies would be losing their lives, too.\n\nYeah, they are working in highly pressurized environments, with extremely combustible liquid and gas, so the risk is inherent—especially when they’re working offshore. But the danger is exacerbated by the crazy demands to continue pumping large quantities of oil, with a focus on profits above everything else.\n\nWhat surprised you most about what the Shell informer had to say?\n\nSadly, I was not that surprised. In all honesty I think that was my big takeaway from the interview. There was nothing she could tell me about that industry that would shock me or that I couldn’t believe.\n\nWhat changes do you hope these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI hope they get more robustly regulated, as I think they have demonstrated they cannot be trusted with our future.\n\nWhat changes do you expect these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI expect that they will talk a big talk and walk a tiny walk.\n\nYou can watch the latest episode of Informer now at YouTube.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Shell said: “Respect for human rights is fundamental to Shell’s core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and is embedded into our existing framework, such as our Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct details how employees, contractors and anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live up to our business principles.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "British comedian Jamali Maddix is well known around these parts for his acclaimed VICELAND show on zealots, racists, and other angry people, Hate Thy Neighbor. Lately, Jamali’s been back on the extremist beat, hanging out with pedophile hunters and a gun cult led by a man named ‘King Bullethead’ for a new TV docuseries.\n\nWe called him up to get a read on Follow The Leader, set to air from September 17th in the UK.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nVICE: Hey Jamali. Obviously this beat is a familiar one for you. But how have extreme ways of thinking, cults, etc. all developed and changed in recent years?\n\nJamali Maddix: I think the internet changed everything when it comes to those communities. If there was a small group in a small town in America, it stayed within that small town in America. But things spread more now, so you’ve got movements or ideas that can spread easily. And the cost of making content has dropped dramatically. So you’ve got men and women making their content, of whatever their ideas are, at a high quality—and they can push it out on the biggest channel in the world, which is the internet, you know? So I think these ideas are more easily accessible than ever.\n\nYeah, it’s also interesting how everyone’s nan now seems to have quite a fringe view of the world.\n\nWhen it comes to certain views—maybe political or low-end conspiratorial views—it’s also because there’s so much information. I think it’s difficult for certain generations to decipher what is and isn’t real, because there’s a generation of people who grew up when newspapers were just… I mean, obviously, there’s always been lies in newspapers, but journalists investigated a story and then they presented the story, maybe with a twinge of political bias, but they presented pretty much the story—and now it’s just, “I can make a website and say whatever I want,” and it’s considered fact. So I don’t think everyone’s got a ‘fringe’ view. It’s just some people can’t decipher between what is the real and the fake thing on the internet.\n\nAI images are going to change things a lot as well, because they will actually trick people’s eyes into thinking real images—things that have never happened—actually happened. It’s gonna be a weird future.\n\nWhat role has COVID played in all this?\n\nI think people during COVID had a lot of time to think. It’s not my line, but a comedian once said to me: “Some people have too much time to think, and they have arguments with themselves that they always win.” I think people had so much time on their hands, and they reflected on their life and made more brash decisions.\n\nIn terms of the new series, Rod of Iron [a militant pro-gun offshoot of the Moonies religious movement, led by brothers Yung Jin Moon and Kook-jin Moon] used a lot of people’s apprehension [of the vaccine] to draw more people towards their ideas.\n\nJamali shares a moment wtih an interviewee in ‘follow the leader’ (credit: uktv)\n\nSo what’s some of the exciting new stuff that you unearthed while shooting this series?\n\nI enjoyed doing the predator hunter one; I enjoyed doing the passport bro one. I don’t know what mad things I uncovered. I don’t think there was like a mad…\n\nPredator hunter as in like…?\n\nIt’s people who they’ve alleged to have spoken to underaged children, and then they go and confront them.\n\nI think there’s something a bit off about that.\n\nYeah. In the film, it’s that complication. That’s what the film’s about, is the complicated nature of it, because we all agree that’s a bad crime, but it’s like, should they be… you know what I mean? All those questions get thrown up, and there isn’t really a definitive answer to it. That’s how I wanted to make it. I wanted it to be as if the audience member decides for themselves, where their morality lies within it, you know?\n\nHas anything in your films made you feel like “we’re fucked”?\n\nI felt that going in.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that’s just apparent with the state of the world. I don’t think my docs are going to be the change of that; I’m not the canary in the coal mine. Human beings, we just adjust. If you would have said pre-COVID, there’ll be a time when you can’t go out for two years. You would have gone, “Nah, fucking I’ll go mad.” But you did it. You know what I mean? If you went to prison in fucking, the world’s worst prison, the first few days [would be tough], but after a couple months, you’d adjust. That’s just how human beings are. We just adjust, or we don’t and we don’t survive. And I think human beings just survive. So I think wherever the world goes, whether it’s the internet or whether it’s this, we just adjust, or we don’t. That’s the two options we have. The films are just exploring what’s going on and the people behind it.\n\nJamali Maddix: Follow The Leader airs on U&Dave at 10PM each Tuesday from 17th September, with the box-set available to stream free on U from Tuesday 17th September.\n\nFollow Nick Thompson on X at @niche_t_",

        "content": "Thanks to some quick thinking, 46 construction workers were able to survive an avalanche and its path of destruction for multiple days. They found shelter in metal containers in the Himalayan Mountains.\n\nOver the weekend, a construction site in India’s Mana village was overtaken by the snow landslide that ultimately took the lives of eight of the 54 workers. The numbers could have been much higher, however, if not for some keen resourcefulness.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nTo survive the avalanche, workers barricaded themselves inside the containers, which had just enough oxygen to keep them alive before being rescued more than two days later. The miraculous recovery that took place in sub-zero temperatures saw Indian army members team up with local disaster forces. The entire operation lasted almost 60 hours.\n\nMetal Containers Saved The Lives of 46 Construction Workers in an Avalanche\n\nBefore the situation, there were alerts put out that suggested rain and snow could be an issue in the area. Drones, dogs, and thermal imaging cameras were all tools utilized to aid in the rescue. The efforts were slowed down due to the poor conditions that included heavy snowfall, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThis wasn’t new territory for the rescue teams, though, as global warming and changing weather patterns have made this part of the Himalayas prone to avalanches. Some of the containers were sent swiftly down the mountain but provided enough support to withstand the crashing tumble.\n\nOne survivor told The Times of India that the container he was in broke apart after coming to a halt, but it sent them down the hillside not far from an army guest house, which they were able to use to survive the night. Perhaps the most terrifying aspect of this ordeal is that they were all sleeping when the avalanche struck.\n\nThe survivors are now recovering in a local hospital with many of those rescued having suffered serious injuries from the cold and being tossed around the metal containers.",

        "content": "No more bald jokes, girls.\n\nI’ll be the first to say that superficial comments and judgments about someone’s physical appearance are not cool. But to label bald jokes a form of sexual harassment? Seems a bit extreme.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nApparently, the High Court thinks otherwise.\n\nThis whole lengthy case started back in 2019 when an electrician named Tony Finn accused his boss of sexual harassment. Allegedly, Finn’s boss at the British Bung Company had referred to him as a “stupid bald cunt.”\n\nMaybe this is my American sensibilities, but I’m thinking maybe the C-word is more of an issue here—but I digress.\n\nAccording to the panel of judges, led by Judge Jonathan Brain, the term “bald” is “inherently related to gender,” so using it against a man could breach equality laws. In other words, “bald” is a sexist insult.\n\nThe three-person panel also stated that the remark “crossed a line” and there is “a connection between the word ‘bald’ and the protected characteristic of sex.”\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the panel consisted of three bald men.\n\n“[Baldness] is much more prevalent in men than women,” they said. (K, well, tell that to the PCOS community.)\n\nNow, according to The Sun, the full judgment made at the Employment Appeals Tribunal has finally been published—four years after the initial comments against Finn. The electrician will likely receive compensation for the alleged sexual harassment.\n\nAs expected, this case is gaining major traction on social media, with many users expressing their disbelief over the ruling.\n\n“This is silly,” one person wrote. “We should all strive to be better people and to be more understanding and supportive with those who are missing something. But it seems silly to waste the court’s time with things so small.”\n\nMost others labeled the notion as nonsense.\n\nHowever, one person posed a different perspective: “I think it’s a bit extreme, but I can see the precedent. If people cannot joke about something a woman cannot control, then why should they be able to joke about something a man cannot control?”\n\nShrugs.",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has suffered through plenty of painful courtroom defeats during his lengthy career as one of America’s most litigious businessmen.\n\nThis time looks different. He’s now officially overdue to receive a downright brutal judicial ruling in a case that threatens to dismember his business empire, drain his cash reserves and drive him out of New York State as a businessman forever.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Aurthur Engoron blew through a self-imposed soft end-of-the-month deadline on Wednesday to deliver a judgment in the sweeping multi-million fraud lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump and his company have already been found liable, and are now just waiting to find out the size of the punishment. That decision could land at any moment, zapping Trump’s business like a thunderbolt when it does, in what could easily be the largest financial penalty of Trump’s life.\n\nThe New York Attorney General’s Office is seeking $370 million, along with a lifetime ban on Trump working in New York real estate or serving as an executive or director of a company based in the state. Judge Engoron declared Trump and his business liable for fraudulently overstating Trump’s wealth for financial gain in September. Now, the same judge bears sole responsibility for setting the penalty. A spokesperson for the court said Thursday that the ruling has been delayed until early to mid-February.\n\nA $370 million fine would follow Trump’s $83 million defamation loss to writer E. Jean Carroll, in a lawsuit over Trump’s derisive denials of Carroll’s claim that Trump raped her in a New York department store bathroom in the 1990s.\n\nSuch mammoth judgements dwarf notable courtroom defeats Trump has faced in the past.\n\nTrump’s company was fined only $1.6 million when it was found criminally liable in late 2022 for paying executives in off-the-books perks in what prosecutors branded an illegal scheme to minimize taxes.\n\nWhen Trump settled three lawsuits brought against his Trump University real estate training program in November 2016, right after he was elected president, he paid out a total of $25 million. In that instance, the NY Attorney General’s office had accused the operation of fraud, saying the unaccredited, for-profit venture misled its customers by calling the business a “university.”\n\nThe New York AG also had a hand in shutting down the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the personal charity Trump founded in 1987, through a lawsuit that forced the operation to dissolve in 2018. The office accused the charity of engaging in “persistently illegal conduct,” and said Trump used the foundation for his personal and political benefit. Yet when the foundation was shuttered, it was only forced to pay out less than $4 million to eight different charities.\n\nThis time, the stakes are much higher.\n\nThe potential combined $450 million in damages from both the New York fraud lawsuit and the Carroll case would equal roughly 15 percent of Trump’s $3.1 billion fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nTrump himself has boasted that his net worth amounts to some $10 billion or more, but independent experts generally assess his real fortune to be only a fraction of that amount, although still likely in the billions.\n\nTrump claimed last year that his cash stockpiles are “substantially in excess” of $400 million. He may in fact have $600 million in cash, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nTrump’s company is notoriously opaque, meaning that it’s hard to know exactly how much damage losing $450 million would inflict. Most of Trump’s known wealth is held in the form of real estate, including Trump Tower and residential and commercial buildings in Manhattan; golf courses around the country; the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; and his Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, NY.\n\nTrump has often boasted about the amount of cash he keeps lying around.\n\n“We have a lot of cash,” Trump said in a deposition with New York attorney general’s office lawyers in April 2023. “I believe we have substantially in excess of $400 million in cash, which is a lot for a developer. Developers usually don’t have cash. They have assets, not cash. We have, I believe, $400-plus [million] and going up very substantially every month.”\n\nTrump won’t have to pay the full amount for either penalty immediately, and hopes to appeal both losses. But the amount will grow while he appeals, rising by 9 percent annually, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump spent approximately $50 million in donor money on legal bills and investigation-related expenses in 2023, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. All told, Trump’s various legal committees spent roughly $210 million in 2023, while raising only $200 million, according to Politico. In other words, Trump’s legal fees are draining resources from his political operation, which spent more last year than it took in despite Trump’s incessant fundraising.\n\nThen there’s the question of whether, once this case and its appeals are all wrapped up, Trump’s family business will even be allowed to continue to exist in its current state.\n\nIn September, Judge Engoron caused a stir when, upon finding that Trump had committed fraud, he ordered the revocation of many state certificates Trump needs to run his companies. The judge said that the companies, which hold many of Trump’s assets including Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, should be turned over to a receiver for “dissolution.”\n\nWhen asked whether he meant that Trump’s buildings should be sold off, Judge Engoron demurred, saying he’d clarify his precise meaning later. That September order is now under appeal.\n\nYet so far Trump has lodged several other appeals related to the fraud case, including an attempt to remove James from the case, dismiss the suit completely and block multiple subpoenas.\n\nAlmost all of those efforts have failed.",

        "content": "Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky wouldn’t concede the point. A tense Oval Office meeting Friday that was supposed to end in Ukraine agreeing to share mining resources with the U.S. devolved into a heated argument as President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance insisted Ukraine should express more gratitude for U.S. support and agree to a ceasefire with Russia, even without clear security guarantees from the U.S. “You don’t have the cards right now,” Trump told Zelensky, as the two interrupted each other during a forceful exchange in front of TV cameras.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We’re not playing cards,” Zelensky shot back. Ukraine's leader repeatedly interrupted Trump and insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldn’t be trusted, noting he had already broken ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreements. Trump bristled at Zelensky pushing back and his voice became sharper. “You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III,” Trump said. Shortly afterwards, Trump canceled a planned press conference with Zelensky and cut off negotiations, writing on Truth Social that Zelensky had “disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” It was a scene unlike any before seen by the public in the Oval Office. Usually in such appearances, two world leaders smile for the cameras and shake hands for the press. The tough negotiations typically happen away from the cameras. But the simmering tensions between the two leaders boiled over in full view, with clips of the meeting immediately gaining attention around the world.\n\nThe two leaders had been poised to sign an historic agreement on Friday to set up a joint investment fund for rebuilding Ukraine that would have allowed the U.S. to profit off mining rare earth minerals in the war-torn country. Ukraine was prepared to put 50% of future revenues from the country’s oil, gas and minerals into the fund. That deal now appears dead. Zelensky was told to leave the White House early, and a planned press conference with the two leaders was cancelled. It’s a major setback for Ukraine. The investment deal was brokered by Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and others as a way to keep Trump interested in backing Ukraine’s security while brokering a peace negotiation between Putin and Zelensky. Trump has expressed frustration with how much the U.S. is spending on military assistance to Ukraine and has said he wants European countries to spend more on security assistance to Ukraine. In three years, the U.S. Congress has allocated more than $175 billion in security and development assistance to Kyiv, according to the Congressional Research Service. In his post on TruthSocial, Trump rebuked Zelensky for operating as if “our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Trump wrote. “I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE.”\n\nAfter the meeting, Zelensky tried to repair the damage. “Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,” Zelensky wrote on X. But even Zelensky’s Republican allies like Graham thought that the meeting with Trump may have done more damage than can be repaired. Graham told reporters at the White House that he had counseled Zelensky earlier in the day to stay positive and not to “take the bait” during the meeting with Trump and that security guarantees could be worked out later. Graham said that the meeting was “a complete and utter disaster” and Zelensky either needs to resign “or he needs to change.” The long Oval Office appearance grew heated when Zelensky repeatedly insisted that Putin could not be trusted and a ceasefire agreement wasn’t sufficient without security guarantees from the U.S. Vance, sitting on a couch next to Trump, interjected, saying that the Biden administration had “talked tough” about Putin and that didn’t prevent Putin from taking more of Ukraine. Vance said it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelensky to sit in the Oval Office and “try to litigate this in front of the American media.” He said that Ukraine has “manpower problems” in the war and should be thanking Trump for working to bring an end to the fighting.\n\nBut Zelensky wasn’t backing down. He described how Ukraine had negotiated ceasefire and prisoner swap agreements with Putin in the past, but Putin didn’t uphold his end of the bargain. “What kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about?” Zelensky said, breaking with typical decorum and using the vice president’s initials. The Ukrainian president told Vance he should visit Ukraine. “Come once,” he said. Zelensky told Vance that if Putin is allowed to continue his aggression in Ukraine, the U.S. would eventually feel threatened from Russia. “You have a nice ocean. You don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future,” Zelensky said. That’s when Trump jumped in. “Don’t tell us what we’re gonna feel,” Trump said. Trump said he had let the exchange continue in front of the press so that the public could see where the disagreement is between the leaders. “I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on. I think it’s very important. That’s why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful. You don’t have the cards. You’re buried there. Your people are dying. You’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good decision — then you tell us, I don’t want a ceasefire,” Trump said.\n\nSoon after the striking Oval Office meeting, a host of European leaders took to social media to express their support for Ukraine. \"Dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone,\" wrote Polish Prime Minister David Tusk on X. \"Ukraine, Spain stands with you,\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared. \"Ukraine is not alone\" added Annalena Baerbock, Germany's foreign minister. \"Germany together with our European allies stands united alongside #Ukraine - and against the Russian aggression. Ukraine can build on unwavering support from Germany, Europe and beyond. \"Sweden stands with Ukraine. You are not only fighting for your freedom but also for all of Europe’s. Slava Ukraini!\" wrote Ulf Kristersson, the Swedish Prime Minister. Zelensky responded to many of the posts with \"Thank you for your support.\" Zelensky had been due to participate in an onstage discussion later in the day with the Hudson Institute. Soon after he left the White House, the event was cancelled. Zelensky did keep his planned interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier on Friday evening. Asked if he would apologize to Trump for what he said in the Oval Office, Zelensky initially dodged the question, saying he was grateful to Trump and to the American people for the support given to Ukraine since Putin launched a full scale invasion in 2022.\n\nWhen Baier pressed him on whether he owed Trump an apology, Zelensky said “no”. He respects Trump and the American people, he said. \"I think that we have to be very open and very honest, and I’m not sure that we did something bad,\" Zelensky said. James Goldgeier, a professor of international relations at American University, says the meeting with Trump was “definitely a setback” for Zelensky. The testy exchange exposed that Trump “has zero interest in Ukraine, and he’s annoyed that President Zelensky’s desire to continue to save his country is getting in the way of some Trump deal.” When Zelensky continued to push back against Trump’s eagerness to work with Putin during the Oval Office argument, Trump launched into his long-standing anger at being investigated during his first term over Russia’s efforts to help his 2016 campaign. He said efforts by Democratic administrations to stop Putin in Ukraine failed because Putin didn’t respect Presidents Barack Obama or Joe Biden. “They respect me. Let me tell you. Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt,” Trump said.\n\nThat tirade showed that Trump is “filled with this sense of anger and grievance,” Goldgeier says. “I don’t believe he’s standing up for America’s interest in this situation—he’s just catering to Putin and sees Ukraine as an annoyance and he just let it all out.” Daniel Fried, a former U.S. Ambassador to Poland, says Vance seemed like he wanted to pick a fight with Zelensky, and the squabble laid bare a conflict among Trump’s own advisers. “The real fight was not Trump and Vance against Zelensky, but a fight within the administration, between those who would like to see a Trump peace plan work and him get the credit, but have Ukraine survive as an independent country, even if without some territory for the time being—and others who want to simply forgo that option and weaken Ukraine and do some deal with Putin.” Read more: Trump Administration Reversed Course More Than A Dozen Times in First Weeks\n\nAt the end of his Friday evening Fox News interview, Zelensky was asked if he thought his relationship with Trump could be “salvaged.“ After asking an interpreter to translate the word, Zelensky said “Yes, of course because it’s relations more than two presidents.” There are “strong relations” between our two people, he said, and it is the American people who have helped “to save” Ukrainians. “We are thankful. Sorry for this. We wanted very much to have strong relations, and I am very confident we will have it,” he said.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The Trump Administration has begun firing probationary employees at the federal agency tasked with overseeing weather prediction and climate research, raising concerns about the nation’s ability to accurately forecast hurricanes, tornadoes and other extreme weather events that have become more common in recent years. The layoffs affect the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which includes the National Weather Service and a vast monitoring system that provides free data to commercial forecasters. The move is part of the Trump Administration's broader effort to reduce the federal workforce and trim government spending, impacting nearly every federal agency.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt least 880 employees were dismissed on Thursday, according to Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the ranking member on the Senate Committee that oversees the agency. Laid off staffers who were considered probationary employees—those who have been in their jobs for a short period and lack the protections afforded to staff members with longer tenure—received an email Thursday, which read in part: “[T]he Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and/or skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.” Read More: How Climate Change Will Affect the Seasons The firings, which are expected to continue in the coming days, have sparked outrage among experts and lawmakers, who warn that such cuts could severely hamper NOAA's ability to respond to the increasing severity of weather events. The National Weather Service, a key division of NOAA, plays a vital role in issuing warnings and forecasts for life-threatening storms, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires. With climate change driving more frequent and intense weather events, the loss of skilled personnel at the agency is seen as a significant blow to the nation's preparedness.\n\n“Going into the severe weather and hurricane season, this cannot be good,” weathercaster Al Roker wrote on X, adding that the agency does more than just forecasts. “It’s fire weather. It’s severe weather outlooks. It’s climate. It’s information that our FARMERS use day in and day out making us the breadbasket of the world. This agency monitors our oceans, our fisheries health.” Some of those laid off held specialized roles, including meteorologists, data scientists, and engineers responsible for maintaining NOAA’s satellite and radar systems, which provide real-time data to forecasters, according to people familiar with the situation. The firings appear to be part of a broader strategy outlined in \"Project 2025,\" a conservative policy framework that has closely matched the Trump Administration’s approach to government operations. The blueprint calls for reducing the scope of agencies like NOAA, citing concerns over spending and what it deems \"climate change alarmism.\" Project 2025 proposes limiting the role of the National Weather Service and suggests commercializing weather data, rather than continuing to provide it for free to the public, which would mark a sharp departure from the agency’s long-standing mission of ensuring that life-saving forecasts and warnings remain accessible to all. Trump, who has long rejected climate change, has not yet outlined his plans for NOAA or for the Weather Service.\n\nHere’s what to know about the layoffs at NOAA. What does the NOAA do? Established in 1970, the agency is perhaps best known for overseeing the National Weather Service and operating some of the most advanced weather prediction and monitoring systems in the world, responsible for tracking temperature shifts, tornadoes, and hurricanes. But NOAA also plays a vital role in scientific research, providing essential data for studies on climate change, marine ecosystems, and the health of the planet's oceans. The agency oversees the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, and NOAA Corps. The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, for example, manages a fleet of scientific and survey ships and airplanes that provide key data for climate, weather, fisheries, and underwater mapping.\n\nRead More: A Mining Billionaire’s Case for Ditching Fossil Fuels NOAA’s official mission is \"to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, ocean, and coasts, to share that knowledge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources.\" Its research and data is considered crucial for meteorologists, but also to industries that depend on accurate forecasting, including agriculture, fisheries, transportation, and the energy sector. What impact could the layoffs have on weather and climate research? The firings come just as the U.S. braces for a potentially intense season of extreme weather, including hurricanes, wildfires, and severe storms, which have become more frequent and intense in recent years. With fewer personnel to monitor and predict these events, experts worry that NOAA's ability to provide accurate and timely forecasts could be severely compromised.\n\n“This is deeply troubling,” meteorologist Jim Cantore wrote on X. “NWS forecasters don't just come in and put a forecast together. They make processes for all forecasters so much better.”\n\nA reduction in staff at the National Weather Service, which relies on a highly trained workforce, could potentially mean fewer meteorologists available to track storms, launch weather balloons for atmospheric data, and issue critical alerts, particularly during peak weather seasons. NOAA, for example, gathered satellite data on the devastating wildfires in California in January that helped inform decisions on the ground.\n\nNOAA's research capabilities could also suffer. The agency is at the forefront of climate science, researching ocean health and atmospheric conditions. Layoffs impacting scientists and engineers working on data collection systems such as satellites and radar could disrupt NOAA's ability to monitor long-term environmental shifts and conduct cutting-edge research.",

        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a tense showdown in the Oval Office on Friday—the likes of which many world leaders were able to watch unfold, thanks to the media being present with their cameras rolling. The pair, joined by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, interrupted each other repeatedly during a meeting initially intended to be about a key U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement. “You don’t have the cards right now,” Trump told Zelensky in the exchange, referencing Ukraine’s ongoing war with Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky responded with a point of his own: “We’re not playing cards.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTrump made various other remarks about Zelensky and Ukraine’s current position, and the involvement the Biden Administration had in supplying support and funds to Ukraine after it was invaded by Russia. Zelensky remained steadfast on his point that a cease-fire agreement between Ukraine and Russia wouldn't be sufficient without security guarantees from the U.S., and that Putin cannot be trusted. “You’re gambling with [the] lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with World War III and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country,” Trump told Zelensky. Read More: Zelensky’s Oval Office Clash with Trump Draws Pride and Fear in Ukraine Trump followed that up by saying: “Your men are brave, but they had our military. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.” Shortly after the exchange, Trump canceled a planned press conference with Zelensky and cut off negotiations. He took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, where he wrote that Zelensky “is not ready for Peace if America is involved.”\n\n“He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace,” Trump said. Following the Oval Office confrontation, many world leaders have spoken out, remarking upon what happened. Many have reified their support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. A few have supported Trump. Zelensky took to posting on X (formerly Twitter) to thank the world leaders who have come to his defense on the platform. The Ukrainian leader travelled to London and met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as planned, on Saturday. Zelensky remarked on social media that they'd had a \"meaningful and warm meeting.\" \"During our talks, we discussed the challenges facing Ukraine and all of Europe, coordination with partners, concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine’s position, and ending the war with a just peace, along with robust security guarantees,\" Zelensky said.\n\n\n\nLater on Saturday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves and Ukraine's Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko signed the U.K.-Ukraine Bilateral agreement. The U.K. reinforced its support for Ukraine with a £2.26 billion ($2.84 billion) loan to bolster Ukrainian defence capabilities.\n\nThe day after: Zelensky met with Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in London on Saturday. The two politicians attended a summit of European leaders on Sunday. Peter Nicholls—Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky was the guest of honor at a summit of European leaders in London, held by Starmer, which focused on Ukraine and European security. Joining various high-profile leaders from across Europe, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was also in attendance. During the summit, Starmer set forth his intentions, revealing that himself and other European leaders will work on a plan to present to the U.S.\n\n\n\n\"In my conversations in recent days, we agreed a group of us will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then discuss that with the U.S. and take it forward together,\" Starmer said, according to the BBC. \"Even while Russia talks about peace, they are continuing their relentless aggression. That is the agenda and we need to agree what steps come out of this meeting to deliver peace through strength for the benefit of all.\"\n\nLater on Sunday, Zelensky was hosted by King Charles III at Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.\n\nKing Charles III welcomes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Sandringham Estate on March 2, 2025, in Sandringham, Norfolk. Joe Giddens—Getty Images)\n\nWith Ukraine and U.S. relations now under a spotlight, Zelensky posted a lengthy statement to X on Saturday, stating he was “thankful” to Trump, Congress, and the American people for their support, and that the country’s help has been “vital” in Ukraine’s survival. “It’s crucial for us to have President Trump’s support. He wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do,” Zelensky said. “We are the ones living this war in Ukraine. It’s a fight for our freedom, for our very survival… Our situation is tough, but we can’t just stop fighting and not having guarantees that Putin will not return tomorrow.”\n\nHere’s how world leaders have responded to the Oval Office showdown: Australia Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reified the country’s support for Ukraine in a press conference with reporters soon after the exchange. “We stand with Ukraine,” he said. “The people of Ukraine are fighting not just for their own national sovereignty, they are fighting for the international rule of law.” Austria Former Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria Karl Nehammer made a show of support to Ukraine via social media. \"The Ukrainian people have been courageously defending their country against the Russian aggressor, for more than three years,\" he said. \"We all want this war to end, at last. Russia is the aggressor and therefore Europe supports Ukraine‘s efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace!\" Alexander Schallenberg, the acting Chancellor of Austria echoed these sentiments. highlighting that his country \"stands with Ukraine.\"\n\nBelgium Belgium's Prime Minister, Bart De Wever, echoed his fellow European leaders' support. In a statement shared on X, he said: \"We stand behind Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their historic fight to defend themselves against an unprovoked Russian aggression. Their fight is our fight. United we are strong.\" Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will “continue to stand with Ukraine.” “Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine,” he said, via a post on X. “For three years now, Ukrainians have fought with courage and resilience. Their fight for democracy, freedom, and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all.”\n\nDenmark Mette Frederiksen, the Prime Minister of Denmark, said: \"Denmark proudly stands with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.\" England Zelensky has since arrived in England for a planned meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as a statement from Downing Street shared that Starmer still expresses “unwavering support for Ukraine.” Starmer reportedly spoke with both Trump—who he met in the Oval Office earlier this week—and Zelensky after the heated exchange. Starmer took to X after his meeting with Zelensky and posted a video of himself greeting the Ukrainian President. \"Action, not just words. Britain stands with Ukraine, today and always,\" he said.\n\nAction, not just words.\n\n\n\nBritain stands with Ukraine, today and always 🇬🇧🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/pDFRjKQYH6 — Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) March 1, 2025\n\nEstonia President of Estonia Alar Karis said his country's support for Ukraine is \"unwavering.\" \"Your courage inspires us all. We stand with you, President Zelensky, and with [the] people of Ukraine. You are not alone,\" he said. European Commission “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission—the executive branch of the European Union— said on social media. Addressing Zelensky, she said: “Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President.” Vice president of the European Commission, Kaja Kallas, supported this stance. \"Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine,\" she said.\n\nFinland Alexander Stubb, the President of Finland, shared a message stating: \"We will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.\" \"The heroic fight of Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression is about the existence of Ukraine as a nation,\" he said, via social media. \"We in Finland understand what Ukraine is going through.\" France French President Emmanuel Macron posted in clear support of Ukraine, stating that those who continue to fight for Ukraine do so “for their dignity, their independence, their children, and the security of Europe.” “There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine,” he said. “We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.” Georgia Georgia’s Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze took to Facebook to support Trump, wishing the U.S. President “endurance and courage” in a lengthy post in Georgian, which could be translated to English on the social media platform.\n\nGermany There have been varying responses out of Germany. Several German leaders have come to Zelensky’s defense. “Ukraine is not alone,” Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote in a statement posted to social media. “Germany together with our European allies stands united alongside Ukraine— and against the Russian aggression. Ukraine can build on unwavering support from Germany, Europe, and beyond.” Germany's current Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the incoming Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also voiced their support, on X. “We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war,” Merz said.\n\nElsewhere, Tino Chrupalla, a co-leader of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), vocalized his support for Trump.\n\n\n\n“Since the E.U. and Germany unfortunately fail as mediators, the USA and Russia must come to an agreement,” he said, via a translated post shared on X. Hungary The Prime Minister of Hungary, Orbán Viktor, notably broke away from many of his European counterparts and showcased his support for Trump. “Strong men make peace, weak men make war,” he said in a post on X. “Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!”\n\nIreland Micheál Martin, the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland and Simon Harris, the Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister), both showed their support to Ukraine via X. “Having visited Ukraine twice, I’ve seen the resilience and courage of its people,” said Martin, who met with Zelensky on Feb. 27. “Ireland stands with Ukraine.”\n\nItaly Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who is well-liked by Trump, suggested a summit between the U.S., European nations, and allies to “speak frankly about how we intend to address today’s major challenges, starting with Ukraine” in a statement released Friday. “Any division of the West makes us all weaker, and benefits those who would like to see the decline of our civilization; not the decline of its power or influence, but the decline of the principles on which it was founded, first and foremost: freedom,” Meloni’s statement continued.\n\nMontenegro Jakov Milatović, President of Montenegro, posted on X to show his support to Ukraine, tagging Zelensky. “Montenegro supports a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and stands with its people in their pursuit of peace,” he reaffirmed. New Zealand Prime Minister of New Zealand Christopher Luxon spoke out via social media. \"New Zealand remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine as it defends itself in a war that Russia started,\" he said. \"It's mounting the defence of a proud, democratic and sovereign nation, but also the defence of international law.\"\n\nRomania Ilie Bolojan, the interim President of Romania, said: \"The security of Ukraine is crucial for the security of Europe. We all need to stand together to fight for our values, freedom, and peace.\"\n\nSlovak Republic Former President of Slovakia, Zuzana Čaputová, who led the country until 2024, posted on X in support of Ukraine, stating that the people are “defending their right to live.” “It’s that simple,” she said. “They deserve all the support they can get to defend this right and to live and prosper as a sovereign nation living in peace.” Slovenia Nataša Pirc Musar, President of Slovenia, said on Friday: \"What we witnessed in the Oval Office today undermines these values and the foundations of diplomacy. We stand firmly in support of Ukraine's sovereignty. We repeat, Russia is the aggressor.\"\n\nSpain Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who recently announced a new military aid package worth over $1 billion to Ukraine, said: “Ukraine, Spain stands with you.” The social media message was translated into Spanish and Ukrainian.",

        "content": "Extinction is typically for good. Once a species winks out, it survives only in memory and the fossil record. When it comes to the woolly mammoth, however, that rule has now been bent. It’s been 4,000 years since the eight-ton, 12-foot, elephant-like beast walked the Earth, but part of its DNA now operates inside several litters of four-inch, half-ounce mice created by scientists at the Dallas-based Colossal Laboratories and Biosciences. The mice don’t have their characteristic short, gray-brown coat, but rather the long, wavy, woolly hair of the mammoth and the extinct beast’s accelerated fat metabolism, which helped it survive Earth’s last ice age. Both traits are the result of sophisticated gene editing that Colossal’s scientists hope will result in the reappearance of the mammoth itself as early as 2028.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“The Colossal woolly mouse marks a watershed moment in our de-extinction mission,” said company CEO Ben Lamm in a statement. \"By engineering multiple cold-tolerant traits from mammoth evolutionary pathways into a living model species, we've proven our ability to recreate complex genetic combinations that took nature millions of years to create.\"\n\nWoolly mice at Colossal Biosciences lab. Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences\n\nColossal has been working on restoring the mammoth ever since the company’s founding in 2021. The animal’s relatively recent extinction—just a few thousand years ago as opposed to the tens of millions that mark the end of the reign of the dinosaurs—and the fact that it roamed the far north, including the Arctic, means that its DNA has been preserved in multiple remains embedded in permafrost. For its de-extinction project, Colossal collected the genomes of nearly 60 of those recovered mammoths.\n\nRecreating the species from that raw biological material is relatively straightforward in principle, if exceedingly painstaking in practice. The work involves pinpointing the genes responsible for the traits that separate the mammoth from the Asian elephant—its close evolutionary relation—editing an elephant stem cell to express those traits, and introducing the stem cell into an elephant embryo. In the alternative, scientists could edit a newly conceived Asian elephant zygote directly. Either way, the next step would be to implant the resulting embryo into the womb of a modern-day female elephant. After 22 months—the typical elephant gestation period—an ice age mammoth should, at least theoretically, be born into the computer-age world. But speedbumps abound. The business of rewriting the genome takes extensive experimentation with hundreds of embryos to ensure that the key genes are properly edited. The only way to test if they indeed are is to follow the embryos through gestation and see if a viable mammoth pops out; the nearly two years it would take for even a single experimental animal to be born, however, would make that process impractical. What’s more, Asian elephants are highly social, highly intelligent, and endangered, raising intractable ethical obstacles to experimenting on them. Enter the mouse, an animal whose genome lends itself to easy manipulation with CRISPR—a gene-editing tool developed in 2012, based on a natural process bacteria use to defend themselves in the wild. What’s more, mice need only 20 days to gestate, making for a quick turnaround from embryo to mouse pup.\n\nIn the current experiment, researchers identified seven genes that code for the mammoth’s shaggy coat—identifying distinct ones that make it coarse, curly, and long. They also pinpointed one gene that guides the production of melanin—which gives the coat its distinctive gold color—and another that governs the animal’s prodigious lipid metabolism. Relying on CRISPR, they then took both the stem cell and zygote approach to rewriting the mouse’s stem cell to express those traits. The next steps involved more than a little hit and miss. Over the course of five rounds of experiments, the Colossal scientists produced nearly 250 embryos. Fewer than half of them developed to larger, more-viable 200- to 300-cell embryos, which were then implanted in the womb of around a dozen surrogate females. Of these, 38 mouse pups were born. All of them successfully expressed the gold, woolly hair of the mammoth as well as its accelerated lipid metabolism. The Colossal scientists see the creature they’ve produced as a critical development.\n\n\"The woolly mouse project doesn't bring us any closer to a mammoth, but it does validate the work we are doing on the path to a mammoth,” Lamm tells TIME. “[It] proves our end-to-end pipeline for de-extinction. We started this project in September and we had our first mice in October so that shows this works—and it works efficiently.” There’s plenty still to accomplish. A mammoth is much more than its fur and its fat, and before one can lumber into the twenty-first century, the scientists will have to engineer dozens of other genes, including those that regulate its vasculature, its cold-resistant metabolism, and the precise distribution of its fat layers around its body. They would then have to test that work in more mouse models, and only if they succeed there try the same technique on an elephant. \"The list of genes will continue to evolve,” says Lamm. “We initially had about 65 gene targets and expanded up to 85. That number could go up or down with further analysis, but that's the general ballpark for the number of genes we think we will edit for our initial mammoths.”\n\nWoolly mice at Colossal Biosciences lab. Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences\n\nColossal scientists see all of this work as just a first step in developing a more widely applicable de-extinction technology. In addition to the mammoth, they would also like to bring back the dodo and the thylacine—or Tasmanian tiger. “Our three flagship species for de-extinction—mammoth, thylacine, and dodo—capture much of the diversity of the animal tree of life,” says Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s chief science officer. “Success with each requires solving a different suite of technical, ethical, and ecological challenges.” The work can’t start soon enough. The company points to studies suggesting that by 2050 up to 50% of the Earth’s species could have been wiped out, most of them lost to the planet’s rapidly changing climate. The Center for Biological Diversity puts the figure at a somewhat less alarming 35%, but in either case, the widespread dying could lead to land degradation, loss of diversity, the rise of invasive species, and food insecurity for humanity. Arresting climate change and the loss of species that will result is a critical step away from that brink, but one that policymakers and the public are embracing only slowly. Restoring the species that will vanish—or fortifying the genetic heartiness of those that are endangered to help them adapt to a changing world—is one more insurance policy against environmental decline.\n\n“We do not argue that gene editing should be used instead of traditional approaches to conservation, but that this is a ‘both and’ situation,” says Shapiro. “We should be increasing the tools at our disposal to help species survive.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson shared his thoughts on President Trump's heated Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday. Moderator Kristen Welker asked Johnson what he thought about comments by Sen. Lindsey Graham—a once staunch supporter of Ukraine on the Republican side—in which he said that for Ukraine-Russia peace agreements to occur, Zelensky may need to resign.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again,” Graham said on Friday. \"He [Zelensky] either needs to resign, and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\" Johnson seemed to agree that “something has to change” in order for peace to occur. “Either he [Zelensky] needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,” Johnson told Welker. At the same time, Johnson maintained that Republicans do “understand” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a “dangerous adversary” to the U.S., and that the U.S. is “not abandoning Ukraine.” He also remained firm on his position that the potential U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal—the discussion of which was the original intent of Trump and Zelensky’s Oval Office meeting on Friday—would be “a win for everyone.”\n\nJohnson continued: “It will give us access to rare earth minerals that we need, and it will provide a level of security for Ukraine.”\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 25, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Ricky Carioti/The Washington—Getty Images\n\nThe discussion about Zelensky’s leadership coincided with the Ukrainian leader's trip to London. After touching down on Saturday, he and other European leaders gathered for a summit on Sunday to discuss a path toward peace for Ukraine. On Sunday evening, Zelensky sat down with reporters at London Stansted Airport before leaving the U.K. He was asked by Sky News what he thought of Graham and Johnson's comments about him perhaps resigning. In response, Zelensky said Graham is a \"good guy,\" but went on to add: \"I can give [Graham] citizenship of Ukraine and he will become a citizen of our country. And then his voice will start to gain weight, and I will hear him as a citizen of Ukraine on the topic of who must be the President.\"\n\nHe added: \"The President of Ukraine will have to be chosen not in Lindsay Graham's home but in Ukraine.\" On the wider topic of resignation, Zelensky echoed comments he made at a press conference on Feb. 23—prior to his and Trump’s pivotal meeting, but amid rising tensions —when he said he would be ready to resign if it guaranteed peace for Ukraine and he could do it in exchange for NATO. Reiterating that stance on Sunday, he said: \"I have said that I am exchanging for NATO membership, then it means I have fulfilled my mission. NATO means I have fulfilled my mission.\" Read More: World Leaders React to Zelensky and Trump’s Oval Office Showdown In contrast to Graham and Johnson, some Republicans are uninterested in mentions of Zelensky resigning. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford appeared separately on Meet The Press on Sunday, and said if Zelensky were to resign it would “spiral Ukraine into chaos.” He also showed an understanding of Zelensky’s viewpoint, stating he was “rightfully concerned” about Russian negotiations.\n\n“No, we’re not turning our back on Ukraine, nor should we,” Lankford said. “Putin is a murderous KGB thug that murders his political enemies and is a dictator.” Other U.S. lawmakers to speak out against the mention of Zelensky resigning include Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who—also on Meet the Press—called Johnson’s comments a “horrific suggestion.” “Zelensky is leading a country, trying to defend democracy against an authoritarian dictator, Putin, who invaded his country,” Sanders said. In the aftermath of Trump’s meeting with Zelensky, many European leaders have rallied behind Zelensky. Sunday's European leaders summit, led by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, considered short and long-term security plans for the country. “I hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes, everyone around this table,” Starmer said to Zelensky at the summit, which was also attended by Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, during his opening remarks.\n\nStarmer went on to share that he and other European leaders will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, and will then present that to the U.S.",

Read More: Zelensky’s Oval Office Clash with Trump Draws Pride and Fear in Ukraine U.S. President Donald Trump directed the U.S. to pause all assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to engage in peace talks with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe decision appears to halt arms deliveries approved under the Biden administration, but it was not clear whether deliveries of ammunition for weapons systems already in Ukraine would be affected. “I feel betrayed, but this feeling is not really deep for some reason. I was expecting something like that from Trump’s side,” said a Ukrainian soldier fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a daring military incursion in August 2024 to improve its hand in negotiations. The soldier spoke on condition of anonymity to speak freely about his thoughts as he was not authorized to speak to the press. Other said the move has left even greater confusion about Donald Trump’s intentions. “The problem is that it’s unclear what Trump wants and what the purpose of his actions is,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, Ukrainian lawmaker and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As of today, it appears that he is increasingly siding with Russia and trying to pressure Ukraine into accepting Russia’s demands.”\n\n“This looks terrible—forcing the weaker side to accept the terms of the stronger aggressor,” he told The Associated Press. Kyiv has feared the possibility of aid being stopped to Ukraine ever since Trump took office, and the U.S.-Ukraine relationship has taken a downturn in recent weeks as Trump’s team launched bilateral talks with Russia over the war in Ukraine and Trump’s demeanor toward Zelensky has become increasingly dismissive. Russia’s state RIA Novosti news agency quoted Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who chairs the defense committee in the lower house of Russian parliament, predicting that Ukraine would exhaust its current ammunition reserves within months. “We need to keep up the pressure and continue to target their bases and depots with long-range precision weapons to destroy the stockpiles,” he said. Trump said on Monday that he is still interested in signing a deal that would hand over a share of Ukraine’s minerals to the United States, an agreement that Zelensky has also said he is ready to sign.\n\n“By abruptly halting military assistance to Ukraine, President Trump is hanging Ukrainians out to dry and giving Russia the green light to continue marching west,” said Razom for Ukraine, a Ukrainian advocacy group. “Razom for Ukraine urges the White House to immediately reverse course, resume military aid and pressure Putin to end his horrific invasion.”",

        "title": "Percival Everett Is Challenging the American Literary Canon",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\n\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\n\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\n\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\n\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\n\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\n\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\n\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "As the U.S. government endeavors to trim its spending, no agency has been as pared back as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). On Feb. 26, after 30 days of what was purported to be a 90-day review, the Trump Administration announced that 90% of the international aid projects the agency was funding were going to be canceled, ending an era of outsize dominance and generosity by the U.S. in foreign aid. These cuts include funding for medical, nutrition, educational and democratic initiatives that were sustaining and protecting millions of people. While foreign aid represented about half a percentage of the U.S. budget, it also represented more than 40% of the world’s foreign aid. The size and speed of the cancellations have reverberated around the world, with many experts suggesting that America’s reputation as a reliable and trustworthy partner has taken a hit simply because of the abruptness of the process.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has said that all foreign-aid projects must make Americans safer, stronger, and more prosperous. Valerie Karr, who has been working in disability rights for two decades, understands that impulse but is aghast at the cost to the people her small business served: disabled children in impoverished countries. For the last six years, Inclusive Development Partners (IDP) has helped implement plans to get children with disabilities around the world into schools and keep them there. Read More: Franklin Graham Thinks It's 'Very Good' to Take a Pause on Foreign Aid IDP was hired by other aid organizations to make sure the work they were doing included people with disabilities. In that way it was occasionally branded as a DEI project, but it was not one informed by identity. If an education program was being established, IDP helped train teachers on how to instruct disabled children. It also helped identify disabled children, who were often kept home, and provided them with the materials they needed to get to school, including wheelchairs and braille books. Now after the termination of its contracts, IDP is struggling to stave off bankruptcy.\n\nKarr, who as well as being president of IDP is an associate professor at UMass Boston, spoke to TIME about how this will affect disabled children, what Americans got out of USAID, and what she learned in the weeks since the foreign-aid freeze was implemented. What led you to found your organization? I got to attend the negotiations for the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I learned the value of the disability community having a voice and advocating for their rights at an international level. In 2018, my co-founder Anne Hayes and I realized that the task was no longer advocating for disability rights; it was, how do we achieve these rights? I’m an academic and she’s a practitioner. Academics aren't good at practice, and development practitioners aren't good at using evidence. So we were meeting in the middle: how do we do quality work, using the evidence base? How can we include kids with disabilities in education around the world? We had a really strong collaboration with USAID. As of Jan. 22 we had 17 programs to include children of all age ranges, from pre-primary all the way through workforce transition.\n\nWhat did your work actually look like? In northern Nigeria, we were working with the International Rescue Committee on a USAID activity called Opportunities to Learn. These kids were out of school. We know that children with disabilities are eight to 10 times more likely to be out of school than a child without a disability. We train teachers how to be inclusive and use something called Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which has been found to not only help children with disabilities learn better, but children who are malnourished, children of minority status, and children who have issues with chronic absenteeism due to child labor or having to support farming communities. In Bangladesh, we work with parents and communities on how to reduce stigma towards kids with disabilities, because kids with disabilities don't go to school for a variety of reasons. The classroom is not accessible. But also parents are scared to send their kids because their child is more likely to be hurt or harmed if they leave the household. We work with communities and schools to ensure kids ultimately get the access they need to an education.\n\nRead More: They Were Promised Flights to the U.S. Now They're Stuck and in Danger What kind of disabilities are you dealing with? USAID started more with hearing and vision and physical disabilities, because those are obvious, but over time—because we're using Universal Design for Learning, which meets the needs of all children—we realized we don’t need to know the specific disability a child has. There's also something called a twin-track approach. You can’t just build more inclusive spaces; kids need braille, kids need sign-language literacy, they need glasses or hearing aids. So we were providing both. In Kenya, 70% of children with disabilities are undiagnosed and in the mainstream classroom. We went in with remediation and after-school programs to help, as well specific universal pedagogy. That program, the Kenya Primary Literacy Program, just got canceled. It was in its first year.\n\nTeacher training sounds a bit amorphous. It’s hard to know whether the teachers were applying it or not. Do you have a success story that you can say, well, here is an impact that we had? We worked a lot on the fact that there were no numbers, there were no resources, there was nothing in place at the time we started, so our progress is much more on intermediary goals. We’ve been working to build assessment instruments, so that this type of data would exist. It’s also what my guide for USAID—published in November and now removed from the web—was guiding other orgs to do: measure the impact of inclusion. Our data in Ghana showed that when you trained teachers in UDL, they implemented it and felt more prepared to include learners with disabilities. What would you say to people who say that Nepal and Bangladesh and Nigeria need to look after their own and ask why America should look after the disabled kids of other countries?\n\nI’d say we do it to develop ties with communities. If you're a parent of a child with a disability, which my co-founder is, and you meet a parent of a child with a disability in a different country, you immediately have a very strong bond. That is a relationship that we have cultivated and really established. So we know that when we need to call on allies and friends, these countries are our friends. They are advocating for the American people as well. We also know that a more educated population has greater productivity. We know there's better economic outcomes and that we reduce migration. These education programs build resilient communities, they build stable political communities, and they build allies with the United States. And honestly, it's working. Nepal was graduating from a low-income country to a middle-income country in the next year or two, and that's because the investment of USAID has helped stabilize and build a system. And that, to me, is success.\n\nRead More: How Trump's Foreign-Aid Freeze Is 'Shaking the Whole System' Did you see this as Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) work? Disability rights have actually always been politically a left and a right issue. Republicans say if you support people with disabilities while they're young, they can get a job, they can be income earners, and that helps the economy. The left has an equal-rights stance on disability inclusion. Honestly, we really became IDP under Trump's first Administration. Over time, we've benefited from DEI, and we, at our hearts, support everybody being included. For example, in our Nepal equity and inclusion in education program, our role was called the DEIA advisor. So we'd seen DEIA have an influence on disability, but they were really pretty different for a very long time. Have you heard from people who are asking where your service is? The harder, more pressing matter has actually been trying to pay people. So you know, we haven't been paid for some of our December work, and we definitely haven't been paid for most of our January work that we already paid out. So IDP had lost about $350,000 and we now are still owed over $250,000. We’re a woman-owned small business. We've never actually generated profits because we work on grants and contracts, there's not actually profit in them. Every line item is accounted for. So we launched a GoFundMe and raised a little bit over $20,000 to avoid bankruptcy. I have employees with disabilities that need to be paid. We owe them money. But they're like, What do you need? Can I write a letter? Can I call my congressman? So I try to look at it that way, that if USAID has collapsed, it's catastrophic for my country and it's catastrophic for my work, but we're still going to all be pushing for inclusion.\n\nHow much of your revenue came from USAID?\n\nNinety percent. In hindsight, did you think, Oh, I really should have diversified my clients? Yeah. We were a group of consultants that decided it was better to work together, because when you're a partner, you're able to really build inclusive systems. When you're just a consultant by yourself, it's hard. It was a great business model to create the change we needed to see in these programs. But because the USAID programs went from one to two to four to 18, it was so much work for a very small staff—we're only 14 staff and nine international. It was really hard to keep up that pace and grow our systems; we were just running to catch up. I don't think anyone could see that a whole industry would fall. I kind of relate this to COVID, right, where we all went in the pandemic. In the first days, you just couldn't believe what was happening, that the world would halt.\n\nIs there one loss that keeps you awake at night? I'm kept up at night mainly for some of our international team members, because I know people live day to day on their income, and that means that you're very close to poverty immediately from this loss. I have been holding off the grief on what it means to the kids. I'll get too emotional at the thought of 10,000 kids not being able to go to school. I have a moral sense of responsibility and failure that we won't be able to do that. I know education isn't as stark as AIDS medication being stopped, or people starving. To me, it is really striking that the American people are like, Oh, I didn't know. There's a lack of consciousness over the atrocity that is happening here. I had a friend from college contact me after one of my posts about USAID, and the summary of that was that kids in New Hampshire need you too. We ended up having a really good conversation. Politically they want us to fight. They want us to think that because I was working for a child with a disability in Nepal, that I was somehow robbing an opportunity from a child in New Hampshire with a disability. But we all care about kids with disabilities being able to have access. I know that a child in New Hampshire is just as important as a child in Nepal. But the money that is saved from USAID is not going to be given to New Hampshire children. They're cutting just as much out of education and Medicaid. This is not an either/or. This is not a red or blue. Everyone wants their kids to have an education and have opportunity.\n\nWhat is your plan going forward?\n\nOur plan is to try and avoid bankruptcy and make sure we can pay out all the people who have to leave, so they have as much money as they can to stabilize their homes for a little bit longer while they search for new jobs. We do have a little bit of U.N. programming and World Bank programming, and if we go bankrupt, we will lose those programs along with it, and that will put those programs in a bind, right? If we can survive, which I think we will, we'll be working on research and programs with other donors and continuing programs, which means we'll have to be small. We'll all go back to being consultants working small and part time and for limited hours, and we'll try and rebuild. We have a hope that the American people will see that aid is valuable, and maybe someday it'll come back, which would be great.",

        "content": "Advertisement Advertisement\n\nRay Kurzweil has been talking about tech-enabled immortality for decades, including in his 2005 book The Singularity Is Near and again in his 2024 book The Singularity Is Nearer. For Kurzweil, the singularity will come when humans merge with AI to become “immortal software-based humans” living in the cloud. Most of the longevity movement is not really about immortality but rather about extending life and limiting the damaging effects of aging. Of course, we all want longevity, and doing what we can to extend how long we live is great—as long as we don’t allow that to distract us from focusing on how to live. The danger of Johnson’s obsessive approach is spending so much time trying to extend your life that you never quite get around to living it. Indeed, keeping death close—even while pushing it as far into the future as we can—has many lessons to teach us about life. Because as one headline from The Onion puts it: “World Death Rate Holding Steady at 100%.” This punchline, that no one escapes death, can of course be confirmed by multiple scientific studies.\n\nWe are not anywhere close to conquering death. In fact, a study from the University of Illinois in Chicago last year showed that though the average lifespan has gone up, the pace of improvement is slowing and the maximum lifespan hasn’t changed as much. “We’ve now proven that modern medicine is yielding incrementally smaller improvements in longevity even though medical advances are occurring at breakneck speed,” the study’s lead author Professor Jay Olshansky says. “There’s plenty of room for improvement: for reducing risk factors, working to eliminate disparities and encouraging people to adopt healthier lifestyles—all of which can enable people to live longer and healthier.” But room for improvement in living longer is very different from delusions about eliminating death. For William Mair, professor of molecular metabolism at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, talk about immortality or radical life extension has a clear opportunity cost. “I worry that in a world where people have limited attention spans, the people who speak with confidence and say they have already cured aging will get the microphone,” he says. “We all age and we all know someone who is suffering from an age-related condition.”\n\nDeath can help us focus our attention on living our best life, because there’s nothing that can teach us more about how to live life than death. Death is the most universal experience, yet we will do anything and everything we can to curtain it off, to avoid dealing with the only plot twist that we know for sure will be in our story’s last act. Here lies the crux of the error Johnson, Kurzweil, and their followers are making: by seeing human beings solely as material beings, they have confused an immortal soul with an immortal body. As the philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin put it, “We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.” Or, as the poet Hermann Hesse wrote, “You will be neurotic and a foe to life—so says your soul—if you neglect me.” We neglect our souls by losing ourselves in endless busyness and never-ending to-do lists while never getting around to the big unspoken item that will eventually get its checkmark. We spend our days accumulating, acquiring, achieving. We relentlessly document our lives on social media to forever memorialize moments we never fully experience.\n\nAs Joanna Ebenstein writes in Memento Mori, in a world that prides itself on being able to control all aspects of life, death is the “ultimate insult.” There’s a reason why death has been a central part of spiritual traditions and philosophy throughout history. “The one aim of those who practice philosophy in the proper manner,” Socrates says in Plato’s Phaedo, “is to practice for dying and death.” In ancient Rome, MM—short for “Memento Mori” which means “remember death”—was carved on statues and trees. The phrase is said to go back to a tradition in Roman victory parades in which a slave would hold a crown over the head of the triumphant general or emperor while whispering “remember you will die,” lest the victor lose his sense of perspective. For the Stoics, accepting death and keeping it close was important to organize and give meaning to daily life. As Seneca put it, “It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.” In Buddhism, the transient nature of life in which “all compounded things are impermanent” is a central teaching. The “maranasati” is a Buddhist meditation that specifically focuses on the awareness of death, reminding us that beginnings and endings are natural and that death is inevitable, which can awaken our appreciation for living.\n\nFor the French Renaissance philosopher Michel de Montaigne, not thinking about death was “brutish stupidity” and overcoming our fear of death is the way to liberate ourselves. “To begin depriving death of its greatest advantage over us…let us deprive death of its strangeness, let us frequent it, let us get used to it,” he wrote. “To practice death is to practice freedom.” For the existentialist German philosopher Martin Heidegger, \"death opens up the question of being.” In essence, facing our mortality allows us to explore the biggest mystery: what it means to be alive. Of course, these questions have not just been asked by late philosophers. “For the past 33 years,” said Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2005. I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.”\n\nWhen we don’t allow death into our lives, we lose the clarity, perspective, and wisdom that only death can bring. That’s why psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross called death the key to the door of life: “It is the denial of death that is partially responsible for people living empty, purposeless lives; for when you live as if you’ll live forever, it becomes too easy to postpone the things you know that you must do.” One of the biggest problems with believing that we’re just material beings and putting all our existential eggs in that basket is that it can diminish our appreciation of the joy, mystery, poetry and love that make life—however much we have of it—worth living. In his book AI Superpowers, AI pioneer Kai-Fu Lee writes about how he once lived his life according to the same operating principles as the technology he was building. “I came to view my own life as a kind of an optimization algorithm with clear goals: maximize personal influence and minimize anything that doesn’t contribute to that goal,” he writes. After being diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma, Lee went on an inner journey to reexamine his life. One person whose wisdom he sought out was a Buddhist priest, Master Hsing Yun, who told him: “Kai-Fu, humans aren’t meant to think this way. This constant calculating, this quantification of everything, it eats away at what’s really inside of us, and what exists between us. It suffocates the one thing that gives us true life: love.”\n\nThat’s the true singularity. Love is what gives life meaning and makes it worth living. No matter what we believe about God or the afterlife, we have a fundamental need to connect — with ourselves, with others, and with something larger than ourselves. And love is both the pathway to that connection and the payoff. When we see life purely in material and empirical terms, we lose access to other dimensions of life—the parts beyond reason and rationality. And what an arid and limited existence that is.\n\nSo yes, let’s do what we can to lead a long life. But accepting that our life on earth will come to an end will make us more alive to it. In a post on X, Bryan Johnson wrote that “The coolest question in existence right now is exploring if we are the first generation to not die.”\n\nIt might be a cool question, but we know the answer: there’s zero scientific evidence that we’re going to be the first generation to not die. But what about a cooler question: how can we live a good life? For that, death is the ultimate bio hack.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "It’s like watching a rerun while you’re sleeping: Once again, you show up for a class not knowing there’s a test, or lose control of your car while driving, or get chased by a shadowy figure. Recurring dreams have a way of popping up again and again. “The dreams contain the same content, emotions, or narrative structure,” explains Antonio Zadra, a professor of psychology and senior researcher at the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine at the University of Montreal. Common themes include falling into space, losing teeth, feeling paralyzed in a threatening situation, enduring a natural disaster, or being ripped off or cheated on. But “a significant chunk of recurrent dreams are idiosyncratic,” says Zadra, who co-wrote the book When Brains Dream: Exploring the Science and Mystery of Sleep. “And some people have more than one recurrent dream.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s what to know about why they keep happening. How common are recurring dreams? The vast majority of adults have recurring dreams at some point in their lives, experts say. For several reasons, women tend to be most afflicted. “Overall, women recall their dreams more often than men, and women are also more likely to have disturbing dreams,” says Michael R. Nadorff, a professor of psychology at Mississippi State University and former president of the Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine. The strange makeup of recurring dreams Research has found that most recurring dreams have a negative tone with themes often related to helplessness, failure, or being chased. But sometimes they can have positive themes, such as discovering a new room in your home or excelling at an activity like skiing. Sometimes these recurring dream themes may feel random. Other times they may relate to an experience from your past or to something that’s currently worrying you. Research has found that people who feel ineffective in their lives and disconnected from others are more likely to experience negative recurring dreams.\n\nRead More: A Guide to Treating and Avoiding Canker Sores These dreams “often correlate with periods of heightened stress or significant life changes, suggesting that they may serve as indicators of underlying anxiety,” says Deirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of the books The Committee of Sleep and Pandemic Dreams. “A specific subset of recurring dreams happen to trauma survivors, especially those with post-traumatic stress disorder. They experience nightmares related to their traumatic experiences.” How recurring dreams make people feel Depending on the emotional tone of the dreams and whether you remember them, recurring dreams can impact people in different ways. Also, “the effect of the dreams strongly depends on their frequency,” says Michael Schredl, head of research in the sleep laboratory at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim, Germany. “I would think that a recurring dream once a year, even several times a year, is puzzling at least sometimes to the dreamer, but otherwise not disturbing. But if the frequency is once a week or more often, then there might be clinically significant distress.”\n\nThe content of the recurring dream can also affect how you feel. After having one that’s neutral or simply odd, you might wake up feeling perplexed or puzzled about why you’ve had this dream again, Zadra says. On the other hand, positive recurring dreams about mastering a dance move, say, can leave you feeling inspired, hopeful, or exhilarated. Read More: Do Pimple Patches Actually Work? Meanwhile, recurring dreams that are upsetting can leave you with an emotional hangover the next day. “Recurring negative dreams can cause significant emotional distress, leading to feelings of fear, anxiety, or helplessness upon waking,” Barrett says. “This emotional residue can linger throughout the day, affecting mood and mental focus.” If these distressing dreams occur frequently, these patterns can even lead you to dread going to sleep, which can interfere with your ability to fall asleep and your overall sleep quality.\n\nHow to make sense of recurring dreams To try to understand a recurring dream you’ve been having, it helps to think about the elements of the dream—whether it’s a tsunami, teeth, or a tiger—and what they mean to you, Barrett says. For example, as far as teeth go, “different dreamers would say, ‘You’d starve if you didn’t have them,’ ‘You can bite people with them,’ or ‘I’d look awful without my teeth,’” she explains. “Each of these implies a different metaphoric concern.” Consider events and emotions that tend to repeat in your daily life and how they might relate to the recurring dream. If you feel overwhelmed and perpetually behind on tasks at work, for example, that might relate to a dream about being unprepared for a test in school or losing control of a car you’re driving. Read More: The Healthiest Way to Clean Your House “By recognizing events and emotions that occurred the day before or the day of the dream, that can help people get a grip on why these dreams tend to come back at particular times,” Zadra says.\n\nWith positive recurring dreams—about revisiting a beautiful place, for example—you also might consider how it could relate to what’s happening in your life. Maybe you’re recognizing an under-appreciated quality or skill in yourself or discovering a new interest you want to pursue. These are the kinds of recurring dreams people don’t mind having, experts say. They can even be motivating.\n\nIt's the negative ones people want to manage. Fortunately, if negative recurring dreams persist, experts say a technique called imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) can help, whether you do it on your own or with the help of a therapist. With IRT, the basic idea is to select an upsetting dream, visualize the dream while you’re awake, change the narrative or outcome in some way, then rehearse the new dream in your mind during the day.\n\n“Change it however feels right to you,” Zadra says. “You might change everything or a small detail or the ending. This has an empowering effect on people during the day and allows you to have some control over what happens in your dreams.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Dr. Frank Frizelle has operated on countless patients in his career as a colorectal surgeon. But there’s one case that stayed with him.\n\nIn 2014, he was treating a woman in her late 20s suffering from bowel cancer—already a rare situation, given her age. But it became even more unusual when her best friend visited her in the hospital and told Frizelle that she had many of the same symptoms as his patient. Subsequent testing revealed that his patient’s friend had a lesion that, had it not been caught early, likely would have become cancerous. “That really brought it home to me—how it’s much more common than you think,” says Frizelle, a professor of surgery at the University of Otago in New Zealand.\n\nStill, like any good scientist, Frizelle was skeptical. Was it simply a fluke that he kept treating strikingly young patients? Or was his practice one tiny data point in a larger trend?\n\nHe found his answer after sifting through national health data: colorectal cancer, he discovered, was indeed being diagnosed more often than in previous years among New Zealanders under 50. Further research by Frizelle analyzing populations in Sweden and Scotland showed the same thing. A bigger picture was emerging. Here were three different countries, with different populations and health challenges—but united by a spike in colorectal cancers among young adults.\n\nPhotograph by Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nIn the years since, it’s become clear that the problem isn’t limited to those three countries, nor to colorectal cancer. Researchers have found that young people around the world are getting many different kinds of cancer at alarmingly high rates. And as the diagnoses of celebrities and public figures like Kate Middleton, Chadwick Boseman, Dwyane Wade, and Olivia Munn bring mass attention to the issue, scientists are racing to answer a question on the minds of many outside the medical profession: Why is cancer, historically a disease of old age, increasingly striking people in the primes of their lives?\n\nGlobally, diagnoses and deaths related to early-onset cancers—those affecting patients younger than 50—rose by 79% and 28%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019, according to a recent study published in the medical journal BMJ Oncology. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most common type of early-onset disease, but recent surges in cancers affecting digestive organs—including the colon, rectum, pancreas, and stomach—are particularly dramatic within this age group. In fact, today’s young adults are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer—and four times as likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer—as those born around 1950, research suggests.\n\nRead More: The Unique Hell of Getting Cancer as a Young Adult\n\nOverall, cancer is still overwhelmingly an older person’s disease. As of 2025, 88% of people in the U.S. diagnosed with cancer were 50 or older, and 59% were 65 or older, according to data from the American Cancer Society. But there is no question that the demographics are shifting. Under 50s are not only at increasing risk of suffering from cancer; theirs is the only age group for which the risk is rising. All told, 17 types of cancer are on the rise among U.S. adults in this age group.\n\n“When we were younger, we assumed the climate would be the same forever. The same applies in cancer,” says Dr. Thomas Powles, a U.K.-based oncologist and cancer researcher who edits the journal Annals of Oncology. “We just assumed that cancer incidence was something that is relatively static. But it’s not.”\n\nThere is some good news in the data. Advances in disease detection and treatment, as well as dramatic declines in smoking, mean that far fewer people die from cancer now than once did. Although the disease still ranks as the second most common cause of death in the U.S., killing more than half a million people each year, mortality rates have dropped by about a third since 1991.\n\nLess encouragingly, the rate of new cancers diagnosed has remained stubbornly consistent, declining only modestly from 1999 to 2021. Across the U.S., roughly 2 million new cancer cases are detected each year, diagnoses that, on top of the emotional toll, force patients to cumulatively fork out billions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs—more than $16 billion in 2019 alone, according to federal data. Today, about 40 out of every 100 U.S. adults can expect to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetimes. For an estimated 1 in 17 U.S. women and 1 in 29 U.S. men, that news will come before their 50th birthdays.\n\nThe rise in early-onset diagnoses partly comes down to advances in our ability to detect and diagnose different kinds of cancers. “With much more sophisticated tools now, inevitably we’re doing more tests on younger people [and] we’re using more accurate imaging,” which leads to more cancers detected, Powles says. Some screening protocols have also been modified in recent years to include younger adults; since 2018, for example, the American Cancer Society has recommended colonoscopies starting at age 45, down from 50.\n\nRead More: Some Early Forms of Breast Cancer May Not Need Treatment, Study Says\n\nBut this is only one part of what scientists say is a more complex web of factors they are still attempting to understand. The data suggest that some element—or perhaps combination of elements—of modern life is sickening progressively younger adults. And right now, no one knows for sure what that is.\n\nThere are plenty of known risk factors for cancer, from the genes someone is born with to the unhealthy lifestyle habits they pick up, such as smoking, drinking lots of alcohol, or spending time in the sun. Such habits can speed up the natural degradation of cells, which over time acquire genetic mutations as they lose their ability to repair damage. As that damage accumulates with age, cells may become cancerous, growing and -multiplying too fast for the body’s immune system to keep them in check and potentially choking out vital organs. The immune system also loses some of its strength with age, making it easier for cancer cells to colonize the body.\n\nBut classic risk factors do not seem to fully explain the recent rise in early-onset cancers, says Dr. Cathy Eng, director of the Young Adult Cancers Program at Vanderbilt University’s Ingram Cancer Center in Tennessee. Some of the trends are baffling; young, nonsmoking women, for example, are being diagnosed with lung cancer in strangely high numbers. Many times, Eng’s patients were extremely healthy: vegetarians, marathon runners, avid swimmers. “That’s why I really believe there’s other risk factors to account for this,” she says.\n\nKelly Spill, 33, was initially brushed aside by doctors who thought her cancer symptoms were related to pregnancy and birth. “If you don’t find your answers, keep pushing for them,” Spill says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nThere’s no shortage of theories about what those may be. Many scientists point to modern diets, which tend to be heavy on potentially carcinogenic products—including ultra-processed foods, red meat, and alcohol—and may also contribute to weight gain, another cancer risk factor. The foods we eat can also affect the gut microbiome, the colony of microbes that lives in the digestive system and appears linked to overall health. Alterations to the gut microbiome via diet, or perhaps exposure to drugs like antibiotics, have also been implicated.\n\nOther researchers blame the microplastics littering our environment and leaching into our food and water supplies, some of which, according to a 2024 study, have even shown up in cancer patients’ tumors. Other environmental factors could also be to blame, given that everything from cosmetics to food packaging contains substances that many researchers aren’t convinced are safe. Even our near constant exposure to artificial light could be messing with normal biological rhythms in ways that have profound health consequences, some research suggests.\n\nFor now, these are all just hypotheses. Some may turn out to be wrong, and more theories will emerge in time. It’s also likely that different risk factors are linked to different cancers, Frizelle says. Even in a single patient, multiple overlapping triggers may be in play.\n\nFrizelle’s research on colorectal cancer, for example, suggests there may be a dysfunctional relationship between microplastics, certain foods, and some types of gut bacteria. Studies suggest that when microplastics get into the body, they can penetrate the mucous lining that protects the bowels and carry bacteria and toxins to the bowel lining. This leaves the bowel more susceptible to damage from pathogens inside the body—including strains of gut bacteria that are known to become more virulent when they interact with compounds found in red and processed meat. In some patients, this perfect storm of invaders may result in cancer, Frizelle thinks.\n\nRead More: CNN’s Sara Sidner Is Demystifying Breast Cancer Treatment\n\nHe believes this overlapping puzzle of risk factors is a likelier explanation than any one lifestyle habit driving a dramatic uptick in cancers—especially since younger generations are, in many respects, healthier than their ancestors. In the U.S., for example, tobacco use has plummeted in recent decades, and young adults are increasingly unlikely to drink. “How is the health-conscious generation getting more bowel cancer?” Frizelle asks.\n\nDr. Andrea Cercek, co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, agrees that some early-onset cancer cases defy easy explanation. She’s treated patients in their 20s and even teens with tumors that, biologically, “look just like a regular 80-year-old’s tumor.” These cases stump her. “Even if they drank as a teenager, it just doesn’t make sense,” she says. A few years of drinking alcohol, following an unhealthy diet, or having obesity should not be enough to produce the kind of tumor typically seen in a senior citizen, Cercek says. And yet, there they are.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, credits his Christian faith with helping him live with lung cancer for more than a decade. “When I was first diagnosed, I was searching on Google for anybody who was a survivor, and I couldn’t find no one,” he says. “There is hope. There are people who are living long and having a great quality of life.” Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nTo Cercek, these advanced tumors suggest that people have been exposed to damaging substances for a long time, perhaps even longer than they were aware of. Research and awareness about early-onset cancer is accumulating now, but the source of the problem may not be new, Cercek says. It can take years for even the most toxic exposures to result in health problems—which means that the source of a problem in the public eye now may have emerged decades ago, silently sickening people until the trend became too pronounced to ignore.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, is one of many patients whose cancer defies obvious explanation. When he was in high school, Oviedo-Mori developed a persistent cough that didn’t respond to medication. Eventually, at just 18 years old, he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.\n\nOviedo-Mori and his doctors were stunned. He’d had asthma as a child growing up in Peru, but he had no family history of cancer and had never been a drinker or smoker; he was barely even old enough to buy cigarettes and still years shy of his 21st birthday. Oviedo-Mori’s family spent a day observing the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack when toxic particles were still in the air, but it had been a brief visit and no one else in the family had developed health problems. That was the only exposure he could think of. The diagnosis didn’t make sense. “It was so weird,” he says.\n\nRead More: 4 Important Steps to Take After a Cancer Diagnosis\n\nAs he went through cancer treatment—including chemotherapy, radiation, and a surgery that removed his entire left lung—he’d look at his fellow patients, and, seeing how much older they were, feel out of place. “I didn’t belong there,” he says.\n\nMore than a decade later, Oviedo-Mori is still in treatment, participating in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering (where all the patients pictured in this article have received care) in hopes of ridding his body of cancer for good. But, though he’s still fighting cancer, he is in good health—he can even play soccer, despite having only one lung, and chase after his almost 2-year-old son. “Sometimes, I don’t believe it,” he says. “I think about [my son] and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re really a miracle.’”\n\nFiguring out how young people like Oviedo-Mori fall prey to cancer is not easy, given the sheer number of potential health hazards in the modern world. It is a puzzle with an unknown number of pieces—one that Dr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is trying to solve with a technique he pioneered.\n\nDr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is studying early-onset cancer using a unique approach that combines epidemiology (the study of population-level health trends) and molecular pathology (the granular analysis of a patient’s tumor). He believes this unlikely pairing will help uncover triggers for early-onset disease. Sophie Park for TIME\n\nOgino and his team are making their way through about 4,000 colorectal tumor samples that came from people who developed the disease at various points in their lives. Each sliver of tissue holds innumerable clues about the person it belonged to, from what they ate and drank to the bacteria that lived in their body before cancer took root. To unearth these clues, the researchers stain the tissues, so that under the lens of a powerful microscope, they can see the different types of cells in the tumor in brilliant color. Using these cell-level insights, they can distinguish between the tumors of young vs. older patients and—with the help of AI—search reams of scientific literature for environmental exposures, lifestyle habits, or health conditions linked to particular cellular traits. Repeating this painstaking detective work enough times helps reveal patterns among young cancer patients, giving Ogino and his team clues as to what may have caused their diseases.\n\nTheir research has already pointed to some possible answers for early-onset colorectal cancer. The big three so far are eating a typical Western diet (high in sugar, processed foods, and red meat, low in fresh produce), developing insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes also linked to poor diet), and having a particular type of E. coli bacteria in the gut. Nothing is proven yet, Ogino says. But since there’s no harm in eating healthfully, he believes dietary changes are worth making now.\n\nOgino personally drinks very little and eats a healthy diet. He makes sure his young son eats well too, since his research makes him acutely aware of the importance of developing healthy habits starting from a very young age. But even for children as young as Ogino’s son, some damage may already be done—at least according to Dr. George Barreto, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Flinders University in South Australia.\n\nRead More: 8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety\n\nBarreto—who started researching early-onset cancer after not just his patients, but also several of his relatives and friends, were diagnosed at young ages—has theorized that damage may start in the womb. It’s well established that the pre-natal period can have long-term effects on a baby’s health, and Barreto believes that phenomenon may extend to cancer risk if parents are exposed to carcinogens during this critical developmental time. This theory could help explain mysterious cases like those Cercek describes, involving patients who seemingly haven’t lived long enough for even their riskiest habits to catch up with them.\n\nProving his theory won’t be simple, Barreto acknowledges. It would require collecting data on huge numbers of people, starting before they were even born, then sifting through that data to pinpoint relevant prenatal and early-life triggers. To speed up the process, Barreto has contacted more than 20 research groups around the world that are tracking groups of people beginning at or before birth, in hopes of using their data to jump-start his research. “If we start [from scratch] now, it will take us 40 years to find answers,” Barreto says. That’s too long to wait, with patients already getting sick at an alarming rate.\n\nThere is yet another question for researchers to answer: whether, on a molecular level, young patients’ cancers are dramatically different from those that occur in older people. If so, these findings may guide researchers toward new treatment approaches.\n\nSome research, including by Eng, has pointed to molecular differences, at least among patients with early-onset colorectal disease. But other scientists are less convinced. Powles, the U.K. oncologist, says he hasn’t seen strong evidence to suggest that early-onset cancers are much different or more aggressive than later-in-life cancers; they just happen to strike patients at younger ages.\n\nCarrie Regan, 41, went to the ER in 2023 because of stomach pain, which led to an ovarian cancer diagnosis. Regan is now in good health and is monitored for recurrence. She wants other women to be vigilant about their health, since ovarian cancer symptoms, like bloating and cramps, are easy to miss. “The day I went to the ER, there was a long wait and I started to feel better. I almost left,” she says. The fact that she didn’t saved her life. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nEven if there is no medical requirement to stray from classic treatment methods—like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery—younger patients have unique needs. Standard treatments, while often effective, can be destructive for people with decades of life ahead of them, potentially leading to life-altering physical changes, like permanently needing a colostomy bag or enduring early menopause and infertility. “The worst thing [for an oncologist to hear] is, ‘I’m cured and my cancer’s gone, but I wish that I’d just lived with my cancer because living like this isn’t living,’” Cercek says.\n\nKelly Spill was blindsided when she was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer in 2020. She was only 28, had no family history of colorectal cancer, and had recently given birth to her first child. She was even more stunned when she learned that her treatment would force her to permanently use a colostomy bag and leave her unable to carry more children. “That completely broke me,” she says. “I’d always wanted a big family.”\n\nJust before she was set to start chemotherapy, however, a research nurse told her she might be a fit for an experimental trial that Cercek was leading. Cercek was testing a new approach among patients whose tumors had a specific genetic mutation: using intravenous medication to boost their immune systems’ abilities to recognize and attack cancerous cells, ideally sparing patients from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\n\nRead More: What to Do If Your Doctor Doesn’t Take Your Symptoms Seriously\n\nDespite all the unknowns that came with participating in a clinical trial, Spill says it was a “no-brainer” to try Cercek’s approach instead of therapies that would leave her with lifelong physical side effects. Her gamble paid off: by her ninth treatment session, her tumor had entirely disappeared. Spill is still cancer-free and expecting her third baby in May.\n\nIn June, Cercek reported that out of 41 rectal cancer patients who completed the full regimen, 100% were cancer-free and required no additional treatment. She is now also studying the method against a variety of different cancers, ranging from stomach to bladder. A patient of any age could benefit from this approach, Cercek says, but it could be particularly impactful for young patients, like Spill, who are desperate to avoid permanent side effects.\n\nEven without novel medical approaches, cancer centers are beginning to recognize that, compared with elderly patients, “adolescents and young adults have very different experiences, and therefore need very different approaches to their treatment,” says Alison Silberman, CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that supports young people with the disease. Physical fallout isn’t the only hurdle to overcome, Silberman says. Compared with older patients, young people are more likely to struggle to pay for their care and to develop mental-health issues as a result of it.\n\nSilberman witnessed these challenges when her brother was diagnosed with advanced cancer in his 20s. “He was yanked out of his life,” forced to leave his job and apartment to move back in with their parents, Silberman remembers. Cancer made him grapple with his own mortality, largely on his own. “He was too old to be a pediatric patient, too young to be an adult patient,” she says. “That was very isolating for him.”\n\nImtiaz Hussain, 31, says cancer is seen as “kind of untreatable” in his native Pakistan. He no longer thinks so, after joining a clinical trial run by Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Dr. Andrea Cercek. After just a few months of treatment with an experimental immunotherapy drug, Hussain felt better. Today, he is cancer-free and a father of three. “I was a part of history,” he says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\n“Care of early-onset cancer patients becomes complex even beyond [medicine],” says Dr. Veda Giri, an oncologist and co-director of Yale Cancer Center’s Early Onset Cancer Program in Connecticut. This spring, the program will launch new services meant to address that very problem. Patients in the program will be contacted by coordinators who can help guide them through issues that commonly affect young-adult patients, from ways to preserve fertility to deciding whether to pursue genetic testing or enroll in a clinical trial. Patients can also participate in support groups with others in their age group, in hopes of improving social and mental health. The goal: to “support patients and their families from diagnosis all the way through their cancer journey and beyond into survivorship,” since young adults cured of cancer may have continuing needs for decades to come, Giri says.\n\nThe ultimate goal, of course—and the ultimate win for doctors and researchers working in this field—will be for early-onset cancer centers to be rendered unnecessary. But it likely won’t happen anytime soon. Proponents of sophisticated new artificial-intelligence technologies have raised expectations, promising new tools that could transform cancer research. AI gives scientists the ability to sift through mountains of data with hitherto unimaginable levels of precision. And the hope is that these tools will unlock a cascade of new discoveries—illuminating unrecognized risk factors, for example, and turbocharging the development of new treatments.\n\nBut cancer researchers remain cautious. There is hope, no doubt—but like the legions of scientists grappling with complex medical puzzles in other fields, they are wary of overstating the pace of progress and raising the hopes of patients, even with new technologies at their disposal.\n\n“It will be impossible to design a clinical trial that can test all different possible causes of early-onset cancer,” says Dr. Andrew Chan, director of cancer epidemiology at Mass General Cancer Center. AI and other technologies may help land on those possible causes faster. But to really understand exactly what’s driving the disease and how to stop it, researchers must work slowly and methodically, studying various potential triggers—from diet to alcohol to microplastics—one by one.\n\nRead More: 8 Ways to Shorten Your Wait for a Doctor’s Appointment\n\nChan’s team is starting with a trial that will study whether losing weight with the help of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound affects future cancer risk among people who have survived early-onset cancer and who are overweight. Future research may study the effects of specific dietary changes, he says. But not all potential cancer triggers are as straightforward to modify as weight and diet.\n\nTake microplastics, which Frizelle, the New Zealand surgeon, believes are contributing to early-onset cancer. Frizelle is realistic about their ubiquity. Avoiding them is all but impossible in a world where water supplies are tainted and babies suckle on plastic bottles from their earliest days on earth. Barreto’s research on cancer risk starting in the womb paints an even bleaker picture, suggesting that the deck may be stacked against some people before they are really people at all. (He chooses to see it more optimistically, noting that everyone can still “take the power into their own hands” by avoiding known carcinogens.)\n\nThe upshot of all this: it could take years, if not decades, to sort out what’s causing early diagnoses, and perhaps even more time to figure out how to stop them. What seems so obvious to us now—the conclusion that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, for example—took some 40 years for scientists to solidify. Even once they did, change didn’t happen overnight. Smoking rates have fallen steadily since public-health warnings escalated in the 1960s, but they didn’t plummet all at once. Still, change is possible. Today, smoking is at historic lows, and lung cancer diagnoses have declined with them.\n\nIf the challenge sounds daunting, for researchers like Ogino, from Brigham and Women’s, the complexities are part of the process. He is reminded every day that good science takes as long as it takes. Many of the tumor samples he relies on in his research came from participants enrolled in a study that launched in 1976. The researchers who started it couldn’t have known that, 50 years later, their work would be critical in the quest to reverse the rise of early-onset cancer, Ogino says.\n\n“That’s the kind of legacy you can make in science,” he says. “That’s a great, rewarding way to contribute”—even if it takes a lot of time to get there.",

        "content": "The standoff at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue was not much of a spectacle. On the first day of February, a handful of men working for Elon Musk had come to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a few blocks from the White House, demanding full access to its headquarters. The agency’s staff refused. No guns were drawn. No punches thrown. Nobody involved the police. But in these early days of the Trump Administration, perhaps no other scene revealed more clearly the forces reshaping America’s government.\n\nOn one side stood an institution with a 64-year history, a $35 billion budget, and a mission enshrined in federal law. On the other stood Musk’s political wrecking crew. They identified themselves as members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a collection of temporary staffers with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authority. Its power derives from Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, who has been deputized to dismantle vast swaths of the federal bureaucracy—slashing budgets, gutting the civil service, and stripping independent agencies of the ability to impede the President’s objectives.\n\nUSAID leadership had allowed Musk’s team, a group of his young and eager followers, to spend several days inside their headquarters at the end of January. “The DOGE kids,” as some of the staffers called them in private, walked the halls with clipboards in their hands, examining desks and questioning managers, according to several USAID officials who described the events to TIME. But as the weekend arrived, their demands—including access to sensitive facilities designed to store classified information—went too far for the agency’s heads of security. The men from DOGE threatened to call the U.S. Marshals and have them clear the building. They also informed Musk about the problem. “USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote to his 215 million followers on his social media platform, X, soon after. “Time for it to die.”\n\nThe cause of Musk’s crusade remained unclear. But regardless of the reason, by the following morning, an agency that annually disburses tens of billions of dollars across the globe, fighting famine and disease and bringing clean water to millions, had mostly ceased to function. Within a week, nearly all its staff were placed on leave, its offices around the world shut down.\n\nPhoto-Illustration by TIME (Source Photos: Chip Somodevilla—Getty Images; Anna Moneymaker—Getty Images)\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nEvery other government bureau got the message loud and clear. No single private citizen, certainly not one whose wealth and web of businesses are directly subject to the oversight of federal authorities, has wielded such power over the machinery of the U.S. government. So far, Musk appears accountable to no one but President Trump, who handed his campaign benefactor a sweeping mandate to bring the government in line with his agenda. DOGE directed all of TIME’s questions about its work to the White House, which declined to comment.\n\nRead More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker.\n\nAlready, the DOGE team has taken over the U.S. Digital Service and established a beachhead within the federal human-resources department, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Education Department is on edge, fearing a self-decapitation mandate is in the offing. Few agencies seem safe. Musk has shown that he will tolerate no opposition, no matter how justified. Days before the drama at USAID, a Treasury official refused DOGE access to the U.S. federal payment system. The official was forced to retire, and the newly appointed Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, gave DOGE the access it demanded. The Administration agreed on Feb. 5 to restrict that access, at least temporarily, after a group of past and present employees sued.\n\nThese are just the first ripples in a massive antigovernment wave. Budgets will be hacked. Valuable programs will be eliminated. Career civil servants will be purged, replaced with political appointees whose primary qualification is apparent fealty to the President. This is the course the electorate chose. And to many, the idea of one of the world’s most accomplished entrepreneurs attacking a sprawling, sclerotic federal bureaucracy with the same velocity and determination he brought to his car startup or rocket company is cause for celebration, not alarm. “The federal government is so big that there are surely significant opportunities for saving and efficiency,” says Robert Doar, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “The fact that the President and his team is giving this a lot of attention is a good thing.”\n\nBut a public backlash may be growing to Musk’s mission, and far more is at stake than the size of the federal balance sheet, the head count at agencies inside the Beltway, or the dangers of one unelected man possessing such unconstrained power. Soon Americans are going to learn where they interact with the federal government in ways they didn’t realize or took for granted. Companies that export tech products to China may no longer have State or Commerce Department employees available to explain, for free, how to avoid violating criminal law. Farmers in the Midwest may soon find USAID-funded buyers no longer paying for sacks of flour to send to refugee camps. Around the world, millions of people who depend on the U.S. for food, medicine, and shelter are suddenly on their own.\n\nRead More: Why TIME Chose Musk As 2021 Person of the Year.\n\nFor now, millions of government workers find themselves at Musk’s mercy. One described her team at the Department of Homeland Security assuming a “defensive crouch” as they awaited a visit from the DOGE. For an inkling of their fate, she added, her colleagues had turned to a book called Character Limit, which chronicles the way Musk took over Twitter two years ago and fired 80% of its staff, often with chaotic and lasting results.\n\nThe similarities to his assault on the bureaucracy have been uncanny. On Jan. 28, millions of civil servants across government received an email offering them eight months’ pay in exchange for their resignation. Musk had proposed much the same deal to Twitter’s employees two years earlier. He even used the same subject line: “Fork in the road.”\n\nNone of this came without warning. Among Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley, many understood his takeover of Twitter as preparation for a greater cause. “The mood is that hopefully Musk can do the same thing with the U.S. government,” one told TIME in November. Veterans of Trump’s first Administration likewise laid out their plans long before the elections, publishing a 900-page report known as Project 2025. One of its lead authors, Russell Vought, said in a speech two years ago that he wanted civil servants to be “traumatically affected” by the purge he envisioned. “We want their funding to be shut,” he said. “We want to put them in trauma.”\n\nRussell Vought, Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, at a confirmation hearing on Jan. 15. Andrew Harnik—Getty Images\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump swore he had nothing to do with the plan. “It was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that,” he told TIME in November. “Some things I vehemently disagreed with.” But once in office, he picked Vought to be in charge of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which now works closely with Musk to enact crucial parts of Project 2025. So far, the frenetic opening moves of the Trump presidency have tracked nearly two-thirds of its prescriptions, according to a TIME analysis.\n\nMusk never hid his intentions. Two weeks after the election, he co-wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal that promised DOGE would help Trump “hire a lean team of small-government crusaders,” who would work to bring “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” That recruitment drive began soon after the elections, drawing from Musk’s acolytes in Silicon Valley, some barely out of college, and priming them to fan out across Washington.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk's Struggle For the Future of AI.\n\nThe man Musk put in charge of staffing at DOGE was an aerospace engineer named Steve Davis, who previously led his cost-cutting efforts at Twitter. In late December, as the presidential transition unfolded inside the White House, Davis took part in a series of meetings with members of the Biden Administration. The Democratic staffers noted his fixation with an obscure branch of the White House called the U.S. Digital Service. Davis wanted to know how it operated, who it reported to, and what it could access.\n\nCreated in 2014, the USDS works with federal agencies to improve computer systems and databases. It houses a map of the government’s technology infrastructure and has contact points for the technology officer at nearly every federal agency. That made it the perfect place to host the DOGE. If Musk wanted to wither the limbs of the federal government, the USDS provided the veins that would let the poison flow.\n\nThe empowerment of USDS started on Inauguration Day. One of Trump’s first Executive Orders renamed it “the United States DOGE Service,” neatly preserving the office’s acronym. The order also ensured that the new entity would report directly to the White House chief of staff. Since then, the office has set up shop inside the Departments of State and Treasury. It began accessing personnel computer systems, firing contractors, and blocking payments on their contracts.\n\nMusk also sent a team to OPM. The office holds records on 2.1 million workers, the email address for nearly every federal employee, and tracks $59 billion per year in federal health care premiums and $88 billion per year in payments to federal retirees. The mass buyout offer to government employees originated from within Musk’s team at OPM, according to a source familiar with those actions. (Both DOGE and the White House declined to comment.)\n\nRead More: As Musk's DOGE Targets Federal Data, This Obscure Office Is at the Center\n\nNext, the DOGE team set to starving OPM itself. Brian Bjelde, who recently worked as vice president of human resources at Musk’s aerospace firm, told career supervisors at OPM that the “target” was to slash 70% of its staff, a move that would hobble its health care benefits and retirement-planning teams, says a current OPM official. Some senior leaders at OPM have been locked out of key databases, the official says, and political appointees have access to systems, including the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, without standard safeguard procedures designed to keep such information private. That system includes information like pay grades, length of service, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and home addresses.\n\nDays after Trump took office, the White House ordered a freeze on federal spending—from foreign aid to public-health programs, and everything in between. It would be lifted, the Administration said, as agencies fell in line with the President’s agenda: cracking down on immigration, ending diversity efforts, and stopping investments that reduce the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Facing a court’s action, the White House rolled back the order.\n\nA protest outside the U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C., on Feb 4. Stefani Reynolds—Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk’s downsizing pressed ahead, and Trump continued to give his blessing. “Elon can’t do—and won’t do—anything without our approval,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 4. “We’ll give him the approval where appropriate,” he added. “Where not appropriate, we won’t.” Some took it as a sign that Trump might rein in his attack dog. But civil servants are not waiting around for that to happen. In Northern Virginia, home to tens of thousands of workers on the federal payroll and military service members, the typical town-hall meeting in the town of Leesburg attracts a few dozen people. Hundreds gathered on the night Musk shut down USAID. “We’re hearing bizarre stories,” says Representative Suhas Subramanyam, the local Democratic Congressman who spoke at the event. His office has been flooded with workers describing DOGE’s takeover, and he instructed his staff to log their testimony and assist whistle-blowers. Much of what they witnessed is “simply illegal,” Subramanyam insists to TIME. “We’re almost being tested and dared to sue or investigate.”\n\nRead More: Across Pennsylvania, Musk Deploys His Fame and Fortune For Trump.\n\nSome lawsuits have worked. The White House complied with court orders blocking its attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal spending. A judge’s ruling on Feb. 6 delayed the deadline for the buyout offer to government employees. Unions have filed suits related to DOGE on behalf of federal workers. Even Musk’s usual admirers have warned he is overreaching. “The lawsuits are already flying,” a Feb. 4 Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “and courts will derail Mr. Musk’s project before it even gets off the ground if he isn’t careful.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Musk’s assault on the bureaucracy has set up a battle with Democrats that could determine the future of the government and the balance of power within it. “We don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,” Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin told a crowd outside USAID on the afternoon of Feb. 3, while the men from DOGE tried to impose their demands inside.\n\nRaskin was right. But the agency staffers listening to him on Pennsylvania Avenue, unsure of whether they still had a job, could not tell how much power Musk had acquired, and whether he would bend the other branches of government to his will. One staffer seemed especially skeptical. Yes, she told TIME, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. But Musk had shown his power to yank it away.\n\n“There’s only so much Democrats can do,” she said, not wanting to give her name lest it attract more attention from DOGE. Her official email account had been shut down, and she could no longer access her desk at the agency. Like thousands of her colleagues, and millions of Americans, she was left to watch Musk’s moves play out, wondering how far he would go, and what, if anything, could stop him. —With reporting by Eric Cortellessa, Philip Elliott, Nik Popli, and Tessa Berenson Rogers/Washington",

        "content": "In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "content": "On Jan. 2, 1988, U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed a revolutionary free trade deal that removed tariffs on goods and services across the world’s longest border.\n\nThe treaty was not controversial in the U.S., but many Canadians feared it would eventually lead to a loss of political independence. During the election later that year, Mulroney had to fend off accusations that he sold Canada out.\n\n“We built a country east and west and north,” said Liberal leader John Turner during the key TV debate. “We built it on an infrastructure that deliberately resisted the continental pressure of the United States. For 120 years we’ve done it. With one signature of a pen, you’ve reversed that, thrown us into the north-south influence of the United States and will reduce us ... to a colony of the United States, because when the economic levers go, political independence is sure to follow.”\n\nMulroney handily won the election, and the free trade deal survived. But 36 years later, as President Donald Trump repeatedly threatens to make Canada the 51st state, it is starting to look like Turner had a point.\n\nTrump’s threats have galvanized Canadians. Polls show they are overwhelmingly opposed to joining the U.S., and they are suddenly open to taking previously unpopular steps to strengthen their country’s independence. Yet Canada is in an incredibly difficult negotiating position because of just how reliant it has become on American markets.\n\nWhen Mulroney and Reagan signed the deal, 75% of Canadian exports went south of the border. It is now 80%. That is not a huge increase, but trade has surged from around one-third of Canada’s economy in its first 100 years to two-thirds today. If Trump follows through on his threatened 25% tariffs, Canada would be plunged into recession.\n\nAnd Trump can make those threats because Canada depends on trade far more. Even for Michigan, where auto parts go back and forth across the border to Ontario up to eight times during the manufacturing process, trade with Canada makes up only 11% of its economy. Overall, Canada-U.S. trade is about 3% of the U.S. economy to a third of Canada’s.\n\nCanada has always grappled with the gravitational pull of the U.S. The first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, built a rail line from the Atlantic to the Pacific to settle the plains and ward off the Americans. The country began to stop resisting the pull of gravity after the Second World War, negotiating the landmark Auto Pact trade deal in 1965. But President Richard Nixon’s 10% tariffs on all imports in 1972 pushed Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau—Justin’s father—to try once again to reduce Canada’s economic dependence on America. His government brought in a foreign investment review process and, eventually, the National Energy Program. But the move infuriated oil-rich Western Canada and regional opposition killed Trudeau’s program, removing a crucial lever that Ottawa could have used in today’s crisis.\n\nRead More: How Canada Fell Out of Love With Trudeau\n\nEvery government since Trudeau Père has tried to diversify trade, with limited success. The gravitational pull of America is impossible to resist—or ignore.\n\nIn 1969, Pierre Trudeau famously told the Washington Press Club that Canada is like a mouse sharing a bed with an elephant: “No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.”\n\nThe elephant is now decidedly less friendly, and is doing far more than twitching and grunting. Trump has agreed to pause the 25% tariffs for 30 days, but that is not enough time to allow Ottawa to reorient trade relationships that have been built for decades around assumptions that are now collapsing.\n\nThe problem for Canada is that it can’t quickly shift its exports to new markets. If the U.S. no longer wants Canadian aluminum or potash, there isn’t the rail and port capacity to send it elsewhere. It’s a similar case for the 4 million barrels of cut-rate crude that goes to the U.S. every day—entirely the source of the U.S. trade deficit with Canada—given the lack of east-west pipelines and other infrastructure.\n\nTrump’s threats have sent an icy jolt of fear through the land, and Canadian opinions have suddenly shifted on pipelines and other questions. Premiers are swearing they are ready to dismantle internal trade barriers. Even former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper—one of the most pro-American leaders in Canadian history—said Tuesday that Canadians must “accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country.”\n\nThe federal government has vowed retaliatory tariffs and provinces have ordered U.S. booze removed from liquor store shelves, meaning millions of Canadians would have to drown their sorrows with rye instead of bourbon. That is a powerful gesture, but last year Canadian tipplers spent $1.5 billion Canadian on American spirits—a mere 0.5% of U.S. liquor production.\n\nSome hoped that the negotiations around the USMCA in 2019 would offer clues to a better approach. Canadian tariffs targeted industries who would have the ear of U.S. decision makers—betting that Kentucky distillers would find a way to get in touch with then-Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, for instance. That was coupled with friendly chats with business partners and politicians in border states who know the value of the northward exports, which seemed to eventually help convince Trump to sign a deal that looked not too dissimilar to NAFTA, calling it the “best agreement we’ve ever made.” But on Wednesday, after Canadian premiers went to the White House to plead their case, a deputy chief of staff reiterated that annexation is the goal.\n\nResistance to Trump’s tariffs on Canada is likely to emerge south of the border, from laid off autoworkers and consumers paying more for gas, cars, and appliances—a political struggle in which Canadians will be onlookers. But Republican lawmakers are lining up behind Trump and he’s said any higher prices would be “worth it.”\n\nWhere does this leave Canada? The unpopular Trudeau is finally on his way to the exit. The once inevitable ascension of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is now in doubt, since former central banker Mark Carney—a Liberal—looks like he might be better suited to managing Trump.\n\nVoters are on track to decide between the two men in an election expected this spring. Both are now promising to stand up to Trump and make tough decisions to make Canada more resilient. Ironically, Trump may have done Canadians a favor by pushing them to do things they ought to have done long ago.\n\nThe mouse has had a nasty fright and is doing what it can to protect itself.",

        "title": "The 1930s Case That Sparked a Debate About Deportation",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has promised the largest deportation operation in American history. Yet history suggests that roadblocks may stand in the path of such an effort. One vivid example from history involves an incident from nearly 100 years ago when conservatives attempted to impeach Frances Perkins—Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Labor Secretary and the first woman to be a cabinet secretary—for not deporting Harry Bridges, a union organizer from Australia.\n\nPerkins’ defense made clear the real limits on the executive branch when it comes to deportations. It also exposed the tension between politics and the law when it comes to deportations, potentially foreshadowing the choice that will confront Trump Administration officials soon.\n\nConservatives took note of Bridges in 1932, when he became a spokesman for a group of West Coast longshoremen seeking unionization. In 1933, their unionization efforts succeeded. The following year, the longshoremen went on strike after employers refused to bargain with their newly founded union. Bridges traveled the West Coast coordinating a strike of all longshoremen and warehousemen.\n\nThe effort proved successful, forcing employers to consent to fewer hours, higher pay, and safer workplace conditions. “We showed the world that when working people get together and stick together there’s little they can’t do,” Bridges once wrote.\n\nBridges’ alleged communist beliefs and labor organizing made him a target in an era of strong anti-communism and anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nIn 1937, the District Director of the Immigration Naturalization Service (INS) in Seattle applied to arrest Bridges on vague charges of subversion. Before Perkins became Labor Secretary in 1933, the District Director's belief that Bridges had committed a crime would have been sufficient to arrest him. At the time, the INS fell under the purview of the Labor Department and thus Perkins’ leadership. She changed policy out of concern that INS was doing things that harmed immigrants. This meant the District Director needed approval from above to arrest Bridges, and department officials determined that his request included insufficient evidence to warrant doing so.\n\nRead More: Frances Perkins Was the First Woman to Serve in a U.S. Presidential Cabinet. It's No Coincidence She's Having a Moment\n\nThe INS officials, however, didn't take that as the final word. Instead, they sent a small team to the West Coast to continue investigating. The investigators later traveled to New York to depose Bridges. Then, Congress took notice.\n\nIn January 1939, New Jersey Representative J. Parnell Thomas, an anti-Communist and opponent of the New Deal, introduced a resolution to impeach Perkins. He claimed she had committed “treason” by refusing to deport the alleged Communist. Thomas misconstrued Bridges’ Communist beliefs to suggest that he supported overthrowing the government and that Perkins, in refusing to deport him, was aiding and abetting this cause.\n\nOn Jan. 21, 1939, Perkins sent a written statement to Congress, responding to an invitation to explain her reasoning for not deporting Bridges. She had “been given no roving commission by Congress to deport all aliens whose activities happen to be unpopular with many people,” she explained. If Congress legislated that she had to deport anyone with unpopular opinions, Perkins added, the Labor Department would follow suit. Likewise, she said she would follow the law if the courts decided that alleged Communism qualified as grounds for deportation. In fact, a case was winding its way through the judiciary on this very topic at the time. Yet, Perkins also reminded congressional conservatives that no one could prove that Bridges was plotting to overthrow the government, because, as she observed, “there is no such evidence.”\n\nIn a climate of broad anti-Communism sentiment, however, a lack of evidence did not stop Perkins' critics. This was especially true as business interests, working to undermine progressive New Deal labor policies such as a federal minimum wage and unemployment insurance, openly equated support for these policies with Communism. Perkins received a slew of hate mail from people who loathed her and Bridges, claimed she too was a Communist, or some combination of the two.\n\nSome of these letters were full of conspiracy theories and antisemitism—despite Perkins explicitly stating that she had “no Jews in my ancestry.” One letter writer charged that Perkins wouldn’t deport the “dirty Harry Bridges” because he belonged “to the same gang” as her. “If you ever would go to see Hitler, he would know what to do to you and the likes of your Jew or Jewess,” read one especially hateful message.\n\nOn Feb. 8, 1939, Perkins testified before Congress to defend her handling of the Bridges case. The hearing took place behind closed doors in a dimly lit, narrow room. She could bring only her Solicitor of Labor. “Do you remember the priest that walked beside Joan of Arc when she went to the stake?” she asked him, signaling how righteous her cause felt. He nodded affirmatively.\n\nAt the hearing, Perkins clarified that she wasn’t a Communist. Rather, she wanted to fix capitalism by reforming it with progressive legislation and social programs. She viewed her reluctance to deport Bridges as a defense of freedom of speech in line with democracy and core American values.\n\nThen she turned her attention to U.S. immigration law. She explained that previous administrations had deported people arbitrarily. Perkins, by contrast, had “imposed restraints upon the arbitrary use of this power.” She did so because she recognized that it was necessary to proceed “in all cases with scrupulous fairness” in order \"to build and maintain confidence in our institutions.”\n\nRead More: What Donald Trump's Win Means For Immigration\n\nFurthermore, Perkins argued that arbitrary deportations violated the law—which only Congress could change. Perkins could deport Bridges only if Congress commanded her to, if he had entered “unlawfully,” if he became a public charge, if he committed a crime of “moral turpitude,” or if he attempted to overthrow the government. The latter provision meant that she could even deport him for joining a formal organization that set out to overthrow the government. But Bridges had committed none of these crimes. Perkins reminded Congress that she couldn’t deport him just for disliking him. Doing so would be illegal.\n\nThe secretary, however, found that a critical mass of lawmakers wasn’t interested in protecting the rights of people who weren’t citizens, nor did they seem invested in upholding the integrity of the law. Their focus was on politics, specifically redbaiting Perkins to undermine the liberal policies she supported.\n\nYet, Perkins made a case for why this was the wrong approach. She concluded her testimony by emphasizing the importance of the democratic method and liberty: by refusing to deport Bridges she was safeguarding these fundamental American values. Had he threatened those values, she would have deported him. Instead, she argued, the biggest threat to those principles was the effort to impeach her for following the law.\n\nThe House never did impeach Perkins. But the process was so loud, the dismissal proceedings so quiet, and the political ramifications so severe that Perkins continued to feel their effects for years. In 1940, President Roosevelt successfully urged Congress to transfer the INS from the Labor Department to the Justice Department in anticipation of American entry into World War II. The impeachment had cemented Perkins’ reputation as both pro-immigrant and a political liability, and Roosevelt wanted to avoid a wartime controversy about how she handled immigration issues.\n\nIt wasn’t just that most lawmakers and voters didn’t want a pro-immigrant Labor Secretary to welcome foreigners during wartime. It was also that they didn’t want to spend government resources and political capital on fair proceedings.\n\nGiven Trump's promises on immigration, once again, officials could face pressures to err on the side of deportations.\n\nBut the case presented by Perkins is a clarion call for abiding by the law, protecting due process, and leaving political sentiments aside. Her example teaches us how such practices can protect innocent people while preventing political chicanery from undermining faith in the American system of governance.\n\nRebecca Brenner Graham is author of Dear Miss Perkins: A Story of Frances Perkins's Efforts to Aid Refugees from Nazi Germany.

        "content": "NZARA COUNTY, South Sudan — Catherine Bashiama runs her fingers along the branches of the coffee tree she's raised from a seedling, searching anxiously for its first fruit buds since she planted it three years ago. When she grasps the small cherries, Bashiama beams. The farmer had never grown coffee in her village in western South Sudan, but now hopes a rare, climate-resistant species will help pull her family from poverty. “I want to send my children to school so they can be the future generation,” said Bashiama, a mother of 12.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDiscovered more than a century ago in South Sudan, excelsa coffee is exciting cash-strapped locals and drawing interest from the international community amid a global coffee crisis caused mainly by climate change. As leading coffee-producing countries struggle to grow crops in drier, less reliable weather, prices have soared to the highest in decades and the industry is scrambling for solutions. Experts say estimates from drought-stricken Brazil, the world’s top coffee grower, are that this year’s harvest could be down by some 12%. “What history shows us is that sometimes the world doesn’t give you a choice, and right now there are many coffee farmers suffering from climate change that are facing this predicament,” said Aaron Davis, head of coffee research at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London. Davis and his team have been researching excelsa for almost a decade, and work with excelsa producers in several counties, notably Uganda.\n\nExcelsa could play a key role in adapting. Native to South Sudan and a handful of other African countries, including Congo, Central African Republic and Uganda, excelsa is also farmed in India, Indonesia and Vietnam. The tree's deep roots, thick leathery leaves and big trunk allow it to thrive in extreme conditions such as drought and heat where other coffees cannot. It’s also resistant to many common coffee pests and diseases. Yet it comprises less than 1% of the global market, well behind the arabica and robusta species that are the most consumed coffees in the world. Experts say excelsa will have to be shown to be practical at a much larger scale to bridge the gap in the market caused by climate change. For now, it’s mostly only available for purchase online. Read More: Drinking Coffee May Help You Live Longer, Study Says Coffee's history in South Sudan Unlike neighboring Ethiopia or Uganda, oil-rich South Sudan has never been known as a coffee-producing nation.\n\nIts British colonizers grew robusta and arabica, but much of that stopped during decades of conflict that forced people from their homes and made it hard to farm. Coffee trees require regular care such as pruning and weeding and take at least three years to yield fruit. During a visit earlier this month to Nzara County in Western Equatoria state — regarded as the country's breadbasket — residents reminisced to Associated Press reporters about their parents and grandparents growing coffee, yet much of the younger generation hadn't done it themselves. Many were familiar with excelsa, but didn’t realize how unique it was, or what it was called, referring to it as the big tree, typically taller than the arabica and robusta species that are usually pruned to be bush- or hedge-like. The excelsa trees can reach 15 meters (about 49 feet) in height, but may also be pruned much shorter for ease of harvesting.\n\nCoffee made from excelsa tastes sweet — unlike robusta — with notes of chocolate, dark fruits and hazelnut. It’s more similar to arabica, but generally less bitter and may have less body. “There’s so little known about this coffee, that we feel at the forefront to trying to unravel it and we’re learning every day,” said Ian Paterson, managing director of Equatoria Teak, a sustainable agro-forestry company that’s been operating in the country for more than a decade. The company's been doing trials on excelsa for years. Initial results are promising, with the trees able to withstand heat much better than other species, the company said. It's also working with communities to revive the coffee industry and scale up production. Three years ago it gave seedlings and training to about 1,500 farmers, including Bashiama, to help them grow the coffee. The farmers can sell back to the company for processing and export.\n\nMany of the trees started producing for the first time this year, and Paterson said he hopes to export the first batch of some 7 tons to specialty shops in Europe. By 2027, the coffee could inject some $2 million into the economy, with big buyers such as Nespresso expressing interest. But production needs to triple for it to be worthwhile for large buyers to invest, he said. Challenges of growing an industry amid South Sudan's instability That could be challenging in South Sudan, where lack of infrastructure and insecurity make it hard to get the coffee out. One truck of 30 tons of coffee has to travel some 1,800 miles (3,000 kilometers) to reach the port in Kenya to be shipped. The cost for the first leg of that trip, through Uganda, is more than $7,500, which is up to five times the cost in neighboring countries. It’s also hard to attract investors. Despite a peace deal in 2018 that ended a five-year civil war, pockets of fighting persist. Tensions in Western Equatoria are especially high after the president removed the governor in February, sparking anger among his supporters. When AP reporters visited Nzara, the main road to town was cut off one day because of gunshots and people were fleeing their villages, fearful of further violence.\n\nThe government says companies can operate safely, but warned them to focus on business. “If I’m a businessman, dealing with my business, let me not mix with politics. Once you start mixing your business with politics, definitely you will end up in chaos,” said Alison Barnaba, the state's minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Environment. Barnaba said there are plans to rehabilitate old coffee plantations and build an agriculture school, but details are murky, including where the money will come from. South Sudan hasn’t paid its civil servants in more than a year, and a rupture of a crucial oil pipeline through neighboring Sudan has tanked oil revenue. Growing the coffee isn't always easy, either. Farmers have to contend with fires that spread quickly in the dry season and decimate their crops. Hunters use fires to scare and kill animals and residents use it to clear land for cultivation. But the fires can get out of control and there are few measures in place to hold people accountable, say residents.\n\nCoffee as a way out of poverty Still, for locals, the coffee represents a chance at a better future. Bashiama said she started planting coffee after her husband was injured and unable to help cultivate enough of the maize and ground nuts that the family had lived on. Since his accident she hasn't been able to send her children to school or buy enough food, she said. Another farmer, 37-year-old Taban John, wants to use his coffee earnings to buy a bicycle so he can more easily sell his other crops, ground nuts and cassava, and other goods in town. He also wants to be able to afford school uniforms for his children. Excelsa is an opportunity for the community to become more financially independent, say community leaders. People rely on the government or foreign aid, but when that doesn't come through they're not able to take care of their families, they say. But for coffee to thrive in South Sudan, locals say there needs to be a long-term mentality, and that requires stability.\n\nElia Box lost half of his coffee crop to fire in early February. He plans to replace it, but was dispirited at the work it will require and the lack of law and order to hold people accountable.\n\n“People aren't thinking long-term like coffee crops, during war,” he said. “Coffee needs peace.\"",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "People may be looking to the federal courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, to halt the massive destruction caused by Elon Musk and Donald Trump. But the reality is that the Republican Justices on the Supreme Court, through a series of decisions on campaign finance and executive power, laid the groundwork for much of the chaos of the Trump Administration. In fact, today’s mess is at least 15 years in the making. In 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission invalidated the federal prohibition on corporate structures spending money on their own political ads and messaging. Later decisions struck down federal regulations that capped how much any one individual could contribute to a corporate structure such as a political action committee and ended regulations that limited how much any one individual could contribute en toto. The effect was to allow superrich individuals to spend as much money as they would like on their own political advertising. So while Kamala Harris outspent Trump overall, Musk, the richest man in the world, was able to pour in almost $300 million to the cause of electing Trump. (And that’s in addition to using the social media platform he owns to support Trump’s candidacy.) In doing so, he helped himself to a seat at the table.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat’s even more galling is that the Court suggested Musk may have had a right to do so, and that if anyone had a problem with that, well, that’s on them. “[T]he First Amendment,” the Republican Justices insisted in one decision, prohibits “attempts to tamper with the right of citizens to choose who shall govern them.” “[T]he whole point of the First Amendment is to afford individuals protection against” “infringements” in the name of “the public’s interest,” they declared in another. Read More: The Cruelty of Medicaid Work Requirements In just the first few two months of Trump’s second term, Musk’s Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) has recommended firing workers at the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees his neurotechnology company Neuralink, the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees SpaceX, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which would oversee digital payment systems on platforms such as X. But the Republican Justices blithely insisted that would never happen, or, if it did, that it would not be cause for concern. In Citizens United, for instance, they proclaimed that independent political spending “do[es] not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” Also: “The appearance of influence or access … will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.”\n\nThe Court’s decisions on presidential power, meanwhile, laid the intellectual and legal foundation for the Trump Administration (and Musk) to assert sweeping power over the administrative agencies that make up much of government today. Five years ago, the Court declared that Presidents generally must have the power to remove officials within the executive branch who do a good deal of executing federal law. Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch used that occasion to call for the wholesale elimination of independent agencies – an idea the Trump Administration has now embraced and invoked to try to fire the heads of the National Labor Relations Board, members of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and more. (Recent reporting on the origins of DOGE confirms that the Court emboldened the Administration: According to the New York Times, “They liked their chances with a Supreme Court that Mr. Trump had transformed in his first term, with a majority that now favored an expansive vision of executive power.”)\n\nThe Court has, thus far, decided only cases about whether Presidents must be able to remove the heads of agencies. But the Republican Justices’ reasoning could extend much further than that –beyond agency heads, to many of the individuals within the federal government. Republican Justices claim that “all” of the executive power is vested in the President, and the Administration has used that idea to argue that, notwithstanding federal laws to the contrary, Presidents can remove inspectors general (who investigate fraud and corruption) as well as administrative-law judges (who help distribute Social Security benefits, among other things). Read More: Eliminating the Department of Education Would Hurt Black Students The Court has even flirted with the idea that lies at the very core of what Trump and Musk are doing—an inclination to dismantle the federal government as we know it. Justice Gorsuch, Trump’s first nominee to the Supreme Court, has railed against “government by bureaucracy” and the “titanic administrative state.” He has urged the Court to revive cases that would prevent Congress from giving substantial authority to administrative agencies in the first place.\n\nSo as Trump and Musk attempt to gut agencies like the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Education, and more, they are demolishing the part of the federal government that the Republican Justices have, for decades, been seeking to raze in their own way.\n\nThe Supreme Court is likely to invalidate at least some of what Trump and Musk are doing. But we should brace ourselves for the reality that the Republican appointees on the Court are likely to be totally cool with a lot of what Trump and Musk are up to. The Justices, after all, planted the seeds for it.\n\nPeople need to continue to show up to town halls and political events to express their dismay and horror at the prospect of Trump and Musk demolishing social safety nets and health, safety, and economic regulation. Those outpourings are reportedly already moving some elected officials. Because the courts were never going to be a substitute for Congress and the public standing up to a self-immolating executive branch. Especially this Court.",

        "content": "Since his first day in office, President Donald Trump has been quick to attack climate initiatives and the green energy transition. The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University has identified more than 50 actions made by the administration to scale back or wholly eliminate federal climate mitigation and adaptation measures since the end of January. Among the biggest targets was the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a multi-billion dollar investment into climate and clean energy, which the Trump administration quickly paused funding on.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe move has brought uncertainty to the clean energy industry. “The biggest effects of the Trump administration on clean energy…has been to introduce massive chaos,” says David Victor, professor of innovation and public policy at UC San Diego. What is the Inflation Reduction Act? The IRA was passed by Congress in 2022, and aimed to reduce the country’s budget deficit while investing in domestic energy production and manufacturing. It was considered the largest investment in climate action in American history, earmarking $369 billion to clean energy and climate projects with the goal of getting the U.S. to net zero emissions by 2030 and boosting American industrial production in the process. While some of the money was allocated to building up established clean technologies, like solar and wind, some funding went to new technologies that might not have been financially feasible without government subsidies, like carbon capture and storage.\n\n“Across the board, it was a huge spending bill that basically made clean energy cheaper, and then put on steroids the adoption of clean energy technologies in the United States.” says Victor. It also brought in a boost of private funding into clean energy. “The risk was reduced by that upfront capital provided by the government,” says Ewing. “It made large infrastructure projects more possible, and this in turn, crowded in a lot of private investment.” The IRA was also established to make the United States more globally competitive in clean energy industries. “It would have allowed the United States to try to catch up with China in key industries, particularly in batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles,” says Joanna Lewis, associate professor of energy and environment at Georgetown University. “If these investments aren't made in the next few years, then we will essentially be ceding these industries to China and others.”\n\nHow Has the Trump Administration Targeted It? On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order called the “Unleashing American Energy,” which called for the revocation and revision of several Biden-era climate actions. The order froze distribution of IRA funds for clean energy and bipartisan infrastructure law—both of which invested hundreds of billions of dollars in energy technologies like wind and solar projects and electric vehicles. In late January, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore paused payments, though they were later found to have continued to freeze funds despite the court order. Areas of the IRA the Trump administration is expected to target next include energy efficiency standards on appliances and a methane emission fee, says Ewing. But despite the pause, much of the funding, which was allocated through tax credits, just might emerge unscathed given that it largely benefits Republican districts. “Most people's expectation is that a lot of the IRA is going to survive ultimately, because it's giving subsidies to technologies that are being deployed in places that that the Trump administration cares about,” says Victor.\n\nOf the $289 billion invested in the construction and installation of clean tech manufacturing facilities since late 2022, districts currently represented by Republicans received $223 billion of that total—almost 80%. How much the Trump Administration is able to roll back remains to be seen. “What they're able to do is partly an open question, but what they're attempting to do is fairly clear,” says Jackson Ewing, Director of Energy and Climate Policy at the Duke University Nicholas Institute. “It's an attempt to deprioritize the energy transition in favor of scaling up oil and gas production in the United States, both for domestic use and for exports.” Scaling up fossil fuel production has been another goal of the administration—on Feb. 14, Trump signed an executive order to create a new “National Energy Dominance Council,” aimed at increasing the country’s oil and gas production— already at an all-time high under the Biden Administration.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nGiven that the funding was congressionally allocated, freezing it will not be an easy task, says Ewing. “There's no doubt that if existing grant monies are attempted to be clawed back by the Trump administration, that a number of those project developers will sue.”\n\nBut even if they do survive, the government pullback means that clean energy initiatives might falter in the coming years as private investors get skittish.\n\n“The overall message behind the executive orders does have immediate market effects,” says Ewing. “There's going to be more reticence to invest in some of these energy transition and climate focused sectors, because the political environment is clearly less appealing for those investments now compared to what it was a year ago or six months ago during the Biden administration.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "It’s been nearly five years since Donald Trump last addressed a joint session of Congress. But after a pandemic, a lost election, an insurrection, two assassination attempts, and an improbable political comeback, he will return Tuesday night with scores to settle and an agenda to advance. At the heart of his speech, sources close to Trump tell TIME, will be a message that he’s delivering on his promise to smash the institutions of government and remake Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAlready, Trump’s presidency has ushered in dramatic change. He’s signed more than 70 executive orders—the most of any president in their first 100 days in nearly a century—on everything from pardoning Jan. 6 defendants and banning transgender people from the military to imposing stiff tariffs on foreign imports and renaming the Gulf of Mexico. He’s also quickly realigning America’s role in the world, voting with Russia at the United Nations and scolding Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky in an Oval Office shouting match. At the same time, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has swiftly commandeered the federal bureaucracy and effectively eliminated a congressionally-approved government agency. Read More: Why Trump’s Speech Is Technically Not a State of the Union Trump’s full-throttle style has made it difficult, if not impossible, for most Americans to track everything he’s doing. In fact, that’s the point. Aides say Trump intends to use his hourlong address to Congress to frame the narrative of his first 40 days and promote his objectives by crafting a series of viral moments that will outlive the speech itself. The approach abides with the Trump World view that the sound bites that permeate traditional and social media in the days that follow will do more to shape hearts and minds than anything else.\n\n“He sees these big media opportunities as moments he can try to make the public think the way he wants them to think,” says Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. Still, the President is contending with some early setbacks and tribulations. Despite his vows of launching a mass deportation operation, Trump has so far removed migrants at a slower pace than Biden did during his last year in office. Many Americans have expressed alarm over Musk’s radical cost-cutting operation; one poll found that only 34% of respondents approved his handling of the job. And the Trump 2.0 economy has yet to show signs of gains: the stock market is down, the price of eggs and beef are climbing, and inflation hasn’t cooled. Trump’s popularity, according to multiple surveys, has been sinking since his inauguration. Trump has routinely blamed Biden for many of his administration’s woes. A White House official tells TIME to expect more of that Tuesday evening. “He’s going to speak directly to the American people about the challenges he inherited from the previous administration,” the official says. Then, in typical Trump fashion, he will pitch himself as the solitary figure who can rescue the nation from decline. “He's going to showcase why he is the man for this moment.”\n\nOn this point, Democrats plan to punch back. They see an opportunity to puncture Trump’s declaration of American renewal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has encouraged fellow Democratic lawmakers to invite fired federal employees and average Americans who have been negatively affected by DOGE’s cuts as guests for the speech, according to a source familiar with the matter. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former CIA analyst, will deliver the official Democratic response. She’s expected to prosecute the case against Trump’s stewardship of U.S. foreign policy in particular. The Democratic retort to Trump’s speech will test a party split on a larger strategy for how to confront the President. Some are pushing for a relentless resistance campaign, like Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “I’m of the school that you have to fight every day and that if you don’t, people aren’t going to think that it’s a red alert moment,” he told NBC News. Others, like veteran strategist James Carville, think Trump’s opponents should simply hold their fire and let the Administration self-destruct. “It’s time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead,” he wrote in the New York Times. “Allow the Republicans to crumble beneath their own weight and make the American people miss us.”\n\nIn the weeks since Republicans gained control of the White House and Congress, Democrats have struggled to combat the President in the public square. That’s no accident. Trump and his MAGA allies have systematically created a communications infrastructure to give Trump a strategic advantage within a fragmented media environment. There’s now a constellation of right-wing networks, podcasts, and platforms friendly to Trump and his army of influencers. Trump’s team has already been working closely with right-wing media personalities to capitalize on Trump’s congressional address, sources tell TIME. Many were invited to the White House last week to discuss strategies for how to boost Trump. On Tuesday night, the White House’s social media team, working in conjunction with online influencers, plan to pick targeted moments to disseminate on social media, where some clips are likely to find more viewers than the full address or the Democratic response.\n\nIn addition to promoting his record, aides say, Trump will use the occasion to advance his most ambitious goals: getting to Mars (a pet cause of Musk’s), winning the artificial intelligence race against China, achieving U.S. energy independence, and ending the wars in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nMore than anything, though, Trump’s first address to Congress will serve as a marker. More than 32 million Americans watched last year’s State of the Union. This year’s speech is expected to draw higher ratings. The reaction of viewers, and the millions who see clips of Trump’s speech in its aftermath, will test just how much Americans really like the change Trump is delivering. “This is kind of an opening to shed light less on what Trump is doing,” says Zelizer, “but where the country is.”",

        "title": "Why Trump’s Crypto Reserve Plan Has Experts Worried",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "After taking a massive tumble in February, crypto markets rallied on Sunday following Donald Trump’s announcement that he would create a national crypto strategic reserve. Trump wrote on Truth Social that a working group would “move forward” on facilitating the strategic federal purchases of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and three other smaller cryptocurrencies. The announcement comes ahead of the White House’s first cryptocurrency summit on March 7, and builds on Trump’s fixation on crypto over the past year, which has included a crypto venture, a “crypto czar” position in the White House, and a TRUMP meme coin which has fallen in price from $70 to $13 within a month and a half.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt is unclear whether taxpayers will fund the reserve, how big it will be, or whether it will be used to pay off the U.S. federal debt, as some have suggested. Trump’s strategic reserve announcement drew criticism from economists and even some of crypto’s biggest boosters. The U.S. has a long history of creating strategic reserves in key assets such as oil, in order to ensure access and stabilize prices in times of crisis. But this crypto reserve seems fundamentally different in nature, because it hinges not upon the asset’s importance to the nation, but the idea that its prices will increase going forward, says Stephen Cecchetti, an economist and professor at Brandeis International Business School who has written skeptically about crypto for several years. Cecchetti called the idea of a strategic crypto reserve “absurd.” “It's foolish to purchase risky assets with leverage in the hope of making it easier to repay your debt,” he says.\n\nWhat is a strategic reserve? In the past, the U.S. has stockpiled scarce assets to protect against supply disruptions. For instance, Congress created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo crisis caused gas shortages across the country and decimated the American economy. Creating a store of petroleum, its backers argued, would stabilize prices. The U.S. has also created strategic reserves of other goods, like medical equipment and helium. “A strategic reserve is for something that is essential, either for national defense or national economic security,” Cecchetti says. “What exactly is essential about Bitcoin in our lives that makes it so the U.S. would want a reserve?” Why do crypto enthusiasts want a reserve? Most crypto enthusiasts don’t want to stabilize prices; instead, they hope that a reserve would send prices shooting upward. Federal purchases of crypto would send a signal that crypto is here to stay, encouraging other respected financial institutions to buy in. Other governments, too, might follow the lead and create their own reserves, further upping prices.\n\nSome Bitcoiners also believe that a reserve could serve as a hedge against inflation. They point to the fact that the dollar has gotten less valuable over time, and argue that Bitcoin’s value could be stronger than the dollar’s during global economic crises. However, crypto has proved highly volatile during recent geopolitical conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And the U.S. government buying Bitcoin could actually threaten the dollar’s global value, some experts say. Austin Campbell, a crypto entrepreneur and a professor at NYU Stern, wrote on X that “We should be doing everything we can to keep our fiscal house in order in dollar terms, which means cutting the deficit and future expenditures to a sustainable path, not trying to YOLO into an asset that benefits from dollar decline.” How will Trump pay for a crypto reserve? On Sunday, many people online expressed worry that a Bitcoin reserve could be funded with taxpayer dollars, effectively transferring money from everyday Americans to crypto millionaires and billionaires. Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks, however, batted down this idea on X on Monday, writing: “Nobody announced a tax or a spending program. Maybe you should wait to find out what’s actually being proposed.” (He also refuted accusations that he personally stands to benefit from the proposal.)\n\nU.S. law enforcement already holds about 200,000 Bitcoin, worth around $17 billion, which has mostly been obtained through criminal seizures. These assets, managed by the U.S. Marshals Service, are typically auctioned to support law enforcement operations and compensate victims of crypto-related crimes. It’s unclear if Trump aims to co-opt those Bitcoins for the reserve, or how the government could go about transferring those funds from Justice to Treasury. In response to email questions, a representative for the White House referred to Sacks’ X post which stated that more information will be provided at the summit on Friday. Could a crypto reserve help pay down the U.S. government’s debt? Crypto enthusiasts believe the answer to that question is yes. Senator Cynthia Lummis, who proposed a Bitcoin reserve bill last year, has contended that because Bitcoin will continue increasing in value, simply investing in it would raise far more money than levying taxes. Those gains, she argued, could then be sold, allowing the U.S. to cut its debt in half in 20 years. (The bill has no co-sponsors.)\n\nBut experts say that relying on a volatile asset like Bitcoin for debt reduction is risky. “Just because an asset has gone up in the past doesn’t mean it will go up in the future,” says Chester Spatt, professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. “If we think our markets are pretty efficient, then we would expect the markets to be forward-looking, and so that would suggest there wouldn't necessarily be a lot of predictive power from the past.” Cecchetti likened the ploy to a homeowner running up their credit card to gamble in the hopes of paying off their mortgage faster. He also argues that using U.S. debt to buy a large amount of crypto would “increase the likelihood that credit rating agencies would downgrade the U.S., increasing the cost of borrowing.” Meanwhile, some crypto enthusiasts are also concerned about what would happen to Bitcoin if the plan actually works. If Bitcoin increases massively in price and then the U.S. decides to sell off the reserve to pay down its debt, that transaction itself could trigger a significant decrease in Bitcoin’s price.\n\nWhy are some crypto fans unhappy with Trump’s announcement? While the larger crypto market responded positively to Trump’s announcement, influential crypto voices criticized it for a slew of reasons. Some pointed to the irony of the federal government having so much power over a currency that is supposed to be decentralized. “It’s wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it’s also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes,” wrote the entrepreneur Joe Lonsdale on X. Others worried that the reserve would become a vector for scams and insider trading. One anonymous trader drew scrutiny for making a $200 million bet on Bitcoin hours before the announcement, and immediately cashing out for a $6.8 million profit. Trump’s announcement also surprised many people for its inclusion of not just Bitcoin, but also smaller, more volatile currencies like ADA and XRP. “So the U.S. will use taxpayer money on XRP, SOL and ADA? Why would one build a strategic reserve of something you can just print? Bad look,” wrote Gabor Gurbacs on X.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity around many of the idea’s central details, it’s difficult to say whether a crypto reserve will actually come to fruition. However, Trump is far from the only one pushing this idea: several states are considering their own versions, including Oklahoma, which passed a strategic Bitcoin reserve act out of committee last week. Utah and Arizona have also advanced similar proposals.\n\nDennis Porter, the CEO and co-founder of the crypto advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund, wrote on Twitter that the group had helped over 20 states introduce strategic reserve legislation. “Yes, many will fail, but all we need is one then the door is wide open,” he wrote.\n\nAndrew R. Chow’s book about crypto and Sam Bankman-Fried, Cryptomania, was published in August.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump may walk into the Capitol like it’s a State of the Union. He may talk like it’s a State of the Union. But technically, the big speech he gives on Tuesday before a joint session of Congress is not a State of the Union address. That’s mostly due to tradition. While Article II of the Constitution mandates Presidents to “from time to time” give Congress “Information of the State of the Union,” early reports varied in frequency and form. According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS): “Between 1801 and 1913, Presidents fulfilled their constitutional duty by sending their yearly report as a formal written letter to Congress.” It was President Woodrow Wilson who in 1913 revived the practice—started by George Washington in 1790—of delivering an oral address to Congress, though some subsequent Presidents still delivered a written message in addition or instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe report was referred to as an Annual Message until President Franklin D. Roosevelt, according to CRS, “applied the constitutional language ‘State of the Union,’ both to the message and the event, which became the popular nomenclature from his presidency forward.” The “State of the Union Address” title became official in 1947 during Harry Truman’s administration, according to the House Office of the Historian. That was also the first televised State of the Union. Prior to the 20th Amendment, which in 1933 formalized the swearing in of new members of Congress to Jan. 3 and new Presidents from March 4 to Jan. 20, the Annual Message was typically delivered in December. Beginning in 1934, 10 months into Roosevelt’s first term, the State of the Union began to be delivered at the beginning of the year (usually January or February but recently as late as March). But the new timing created a question of whose responsibility it was to deliver the report in an inauguration year: the outgoing or incoming President?\n\nAccording to another CRS report, some Presidents “have chosen not to deliver a State of the Union address in the last January before they depart from office, or in the year they were inaugurated.” But not in 1981. That year, outgoing President Jimmy Carter delivered a written message to Congress on Jan. 16, and newly-inaugurated President Ronald Reagan delivered an oral address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 18. But Reagan started a new tradition: his inauguration-year speech to Congress explicitly was not a State of the Union address. Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Trump, and Joe Biden have all followed suit, delivering speeches that are not State of the Union addresses to a joint session of Congress in the weeks after their inauguration. (Reagan called his speech “Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the Program for Economic Recovery,” while the Bushes and Clinton called theirs addresses “on Administration Goals,” and Obama, Trump, and Biden simply called theirs “Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress.”)\n\nBut the fact that these speeches are technically not State of the Union addresses makes little difference, according to the American Presidency Project, which says the “impact of such a speech on public, media, and congressional perceptions of presidential leadership and power should be the same.”\n\nFor Trump’s part, the speech on Tuesday will be an opportunity for him to discuss the first six weeks of his second term that have upended Washington and the world and to outline his agenda for the weeks and years ahead. “TOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE BIG,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday. “I WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS!”",

As founder and CEO of the nonprofit Springboard to Opportunities in Jackson, Miss., she was committed to helping lift families in local public housing into the next phase—a place of their own. But her organization wasn’t moving the needle. “We were doing everything, from after-school programs, work-training programs, mommy and me, reading programs, all of these different activities and services we were providing on site,” says Nyandoro, 45. “But we were not actually seeing families successfully transition out of affordable housing, and that was important to us, because that was important to the families.”\n\nSo her organization spent some time talking to the mothers and came up with a solution that was at once extremely simple and very complicated. These mothers needed cash. Not in the form of housing vouchers. Not in the form of credits that could be used at a grocery store. Not in the form of free health care. Just plain old moolah. Loot. Legal tender.\n\nMoney—the type that can be spent on anything—has been out of favor as a method of helping impoverished Americans. Mississippi has been so allergic to giving its citizens cash that Congress held hearings in September to understand how the state mismanaged federal funds for needy families. The year before Nyandoro came to her realization, fewer than 2% of Mississippi's low-income families who applied for welfare payments from the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program had been approved. Meanwhile money from that fund has been lavished on almost anything else, including a $5 million volleyball stadium, payments to sports celebrities, and boot-camp-style fitness programs. And Mississippi is not alone. “We got caught, but I don't believe that we are the only state that is using TANF funds erroneously,” says Nyandoro.\n\nIn 2018, Nyandoro founded the Magnolia Mother’s Trust, a fund that gave 20 mothers in Jackson $1,000 a month for a year. Any Black mother living in the housing complexes that Springboard served could apply; the first 20 recipients’ names were drawn out of a box. Nyandoro called each one personally. She physically signed each check, put it in an envelope, and gave it to recipients in time for Christmas.\n\nThis modest program was the first guaranteed-income project in the 21st century, and nobody knew quite what to expect. Not all of the mothers flourished—getting people out of poverty is rarely a linear process—but most did. They paid off debts, fixed cars, made sure everyone had enough to eat, enrolled their children in activities, invested in their own business, went back to school, and socked away what they could for the future. Most of all, they got to think about something besides bills. They had enough stability to plan.\n\nPhotograph by Lelanie Foster for TIME\n\nThis fall Magnolia will welcome its sixth set of mothers, this time numbering more than 100. These moms will also get a 529 educational savings account for each child with $1,000 deposited in it. So far the trust has directly helped more than 400 families, but more importantly, it has provided a proof of concept for how to administer such a cash-provision program. There are now 150 similar initiatives around America. The Magnolia Mother’s model was echoed in the expanded child-tax-credit payments that lifted millions of kids out of poverty during the pandemic. The idea has been championed by Vice President Kamala Harris, who has proposed a tax credit of $6,000 in the first year of an infant’s life followed by an annual credit of up to $3,600, and vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, who has floated a tax credit of $5,000 per child annually. Even the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the agency that provides housing vouchers, is exploring the possibilities of cash.\n\n“I think of her as spurring the current momentum that has led to these thousand flowers blooming all over the country,” says University of Michigan professor of public policy Luke Shaefer, whose book $2 a Day, co-authored with Kathryn Edin, was also an influential work among advocates of cash assistance. “She was the first one to get it off the ground.”\n\nThe lift was considerable. Shaefer has found opposition to cash assistance to be a rare nonpartisan issue. Conservatives oppose it because they believe it’s expensive, disincentivizes work, and people will fritter it away. Progressives oppose it, he has noticed, because they feel like it might jeopardize funds for the work they’re doing in social services.\n\n“If we give people money, what will happen? I myself had that question,” says Natalie Foster, president and co-founder of the Economic Security Project and author of The Guarantee: Inside the Fight for America’s Next Economy. “The evidence made it very clear that people continue working. People are working incredibly hard in this economy just to get by, and a guaranteed income creates a bit more breathing room. Study after study after study has shown that to be true.”\n\nBut back in 2018, Nyandoro had a tough time getting donors to understand why her approach was important. Even worse, she kept running up against the narrative that poor Black mothers couldn’t be trusted with the flexibility of cash. “The amount of toxicity that, quite frankly, I had to take on just trying to help people understand what this work was was really probably one of the darkest times of my life,” she says. “It's when I truly realized how disconnected the majority of people are from people.” She made a last-ditch call to one of her existing Springboard donors (who does not wish to be named), who agreed to fund the pilot program.\n\nOne recipient that first year who particularly affected Nyandoro was a mother whose children had only met their grandfather on FaceTime because he lived in Pittsburgh. The mama—as Nyandoro calls the women she works with—used some of the cash to take her children to visit him on spring break. “She didn't fly, she didn't do anything luxurious like that,” recalls Nyandoro. “She just made sure that her car was in decent working order, and she drove to Pittsburgh so her kids could meet their grandfather for the first time. Seeing what that did for herself and her father and her kids, it just broke me.” In a later program, a mother used her first check to pay off her $300 debt at the local community college so she could resume the phlebotomy course she could not attend until her back fees were paid.\n\nAisha Nyandoro Lelanie Foster for TIME\n\nNyandoro was raised in Mississippi in a family rich in civic-mindedness. Her grandmother, L.C. Dorsey, the daughter of sharecroppers, left school to get married when she got pregnant at 17, but was drawn into the civil rights movement after she became friends with Fannie Lou Hamer. She helped start the first rural community health center in America, advocated for civil rights and prison reform, and served on President Jimmy Carter’s National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity. She also resumed her education and went on to get a PhD in social work. Nyandoro’s mother was a social worker and her father an elder in the AME Church; community issues were frequent topics of discussion around the dinner table. “I always knew I’d work in advocacy, because of how I grew up,” says Nyandoro.\n\nToday, Black families have the second-highest poverty rate in the U.S., after only Native Americans, with 21.2% living below the poverty line. And 27% of Black families with single mothers live in poverty, according to Census Bureau data. Nevertheless, the hardy stereotype of the single Black mother as a welfare queen, living large on public benefits, still affects so much of the way government assistance is distributed. “Black mothers get demonized,” says Shaefer. “I think Aisha is really a big part of stopping that train and moving it in a different direction, in terms of a different vision of Black motherhood and a different vision of the safety net.”\n\nMothers who get assistance from Magnolia do not want to be on the program permanently. “Time and time again, our mamas tell us that one year is enough, because they really just use it as a year of breathing room, as a year of planning and being very strategic in how they go about doing their work,” says Nyandoro. “They also say they don't want to become dependent on it.”\n\nThe real difference between cash-assistance programs and aid that is tied to specific needs, such as housing vouchers, is the amount of agency recipients have. Giving out cash suggests that the donor believes the beneficiary knows how best to address her own needs. Nyandoro, who has now won a slew of awards and is in demand as an expert on anti-poverty initiatives, often talks about dignity, which to people with enough sounds like a luxury item, but to these women means something more profound–that they can be trusted, that they know what’s optimal for their families, and that they can make decisions without seeking anyone’s permission or approval.\n\n“We don't understand how simple poverty is, and we try to make it overcomplicated,” she says. “Poverty is really about a lack of financial resources and about systems that we have all allowed to be put in place because we all benefit from them. But the narrative we tell ourselves is that people are poor because they choose to be poor, and are making bad financial decisions, and if they made better financial decisions, they wouldn't be poor. This is not true.” With the work of Magnolia Mother’s Trust, Nyandoro has the receipts to prove it.\n\nHair and makeup by Carla Pressley",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — Key Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been stalwart supporters of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but the blowup between the Ukrainian leader and President Donald Trump is threatening to change that. Zelensky had traveled to Washington to sign a deal that would give the U.S. access to its mineral riches as Trump attempts to pressure Ukraine into a deal to end the war with Russia. Although support for Ukraine has waned among GOP congressional members in the three years since Russia invaded, key Republicans hoped the deal would revive American support for Kyiv.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInstead, the fallout from a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelensky and Vice President J.D. Vance has many Republicans — even those who previously backed Ukraine — scolding Zelensky. For other GOP lawmakers who have long criticized U.S. support for Ukraine, the exchange was an opportunity to laud Trump for berating Ukraine's leader.

What we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an American President putting America first.” REP. DON BACON, Nebraska “A bad day for America’s foreign policy.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Dunn, a former practicing attorney, professor, and nonprofit executive, is a consultant focusing on systemic equity, diversity, and inclusion. She is the author of Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work\n\nThe term “imposter syndrome” has become a cultural shorthand for self-doubt. We’re told it’s something to fix within ourselves: a nagging belief that we’re unqualified or unworthy, even when all evidence points to the contrary. Yet for many women—and especially women of color—this framing misses the mark entirely.\n\nIn reality, what’s labeled as imposter syndrome in the workplace is often a misdiagnosis—a symptom of systemic inequities. It’s a response to environments steeped in bias, exclusion, and relentless scrutiny of the competence of women, Black professionals, and other people of color, a practice known as “competency checking.” Competency checking—whether intentional or unconscious—undermines those who challenge traditional norms of leadership and success. Imposter syndrome, however, masquerades as an internal failing, leading women to pathologize themselves rather than confront the systems perpetuating their struggles.\n\nThis misidentification was never clearer to me than during a conversation with a prospective client—a white woman—about a keynote speech on imposter syndrome. I explained my view: imposter syndrome is a catch-all term that obscures the real culprits—sexism, racism, and white supremacy. It can set up women to blame themselves for what is actually persistent, systemic competency checking.\n\nThe woman was visibly taken aback. She said that none of the consultants she had spoken with framed the issue this way, and one consultant had even claimed that “Everyone has imposter syndrome, and anyone who says they don’t is a liar or a narcissist.” This reductive and harmful framing shocked me. Imposter syndrome isn’t recognized as a psychiatric disorder; it’s not listed in the DSM-5 or the International Classification of Diseases. Yet the notion that everyone suffers from it has become pervasive.\n\nRead More: Yes, Impostor Syndrome Is Real. Here’s How to Deal With It\n\nI explained to her that feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty are part of being human. But these feelings differ from the systemic barriers and biases that create environments where women—and especially women of color—are made to feel unworthy. Black women, for instance, often reject the idea that they are imposters. Instead, they focus on the challenges of working within systems not designed for their success. This difference in perception can create friction with white women, who may frame these struggles through a lens of personal failings, a narrative that imposter syndrome encourages.\n\nCiting global inclusion strategist Ruchika Malhotra and writer Jodi-Ann Burey’s Harvard Business Review article “Stop Telling Women They Have Imposter Syndrome,” I emphasized that self-doubt often reflects a rational response to systemic bias. As Malhotra and Burey put it, “Impostor syndrome directs our view toward fixing women at work instead of fixing the places where women work.”\n\nUnmasking the villain\n\nI often use a metaphor inspired by Scooby-Doo to explain this dynamic. In every episode, Scooby and the gang unmask a ghostly villain, revealing it to be someone using fear to hide their schemes. Imposter syndrome is a similar mask, obscuring systemic inequities that fuel self-doubt. Once the mask is removed, the real question is: How did we get here, and why do so many—particularly white women—believe the ghost is real?\n\nThe origins of the term “impostor phenomenon,” coined in 1978, offer clues. Psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes described the experiences of 178 predominantly white, upper-middle-class women who felt intellectually fraudulent despite their achievements. The study framed their feelings as internal failings rather than responses to external pressures, such as patriarchy and white supremacy, which drive perfectionism. It overlooked the realities of sexism, classism, and racism—and the complex interplay of these forces.\n\nIf the study had included women of color, working-class white women, or others excluded from its narrow lens, it might have painted a different picture. Take Crystal Lee Sutton, the real-life inspiration for the movie Norma Rae. In 1978, when Sutton stopped her work and famously stood up on a table in the mill to protest the impact of unchecked capitalism, sexism, and racism on the poor and working-class women who worked there, she didn’t hold up a sign saying she felt like an imposter; she held up a sign that said “UNION.”\n\nThere must have been days when Sutton felt uncertain or even like a fraud—not because of a clinical disorder but because she was human. Yet she identified the real culprit: The systemic exploitation of working poor women. Sutton understood that change required building a coalition of white and Black women to challenge the status quo. She correctly identified the external factors—and fought back with the right medicine: solidarity.\n\nReimagining the solution\n\nTo move beyond imposter syndrome, we must reframe it as a systemic issue rather than an individual failing. Workplaces must become environments where microaggressions, implicit bias, and inequitable opportunities are actively dismantled. Women must recognize that self-doubt often reflects competency checking, not their actual abilities.\n\nSolidarity is crucial. Women of all backgrounds must come together to challenge the status quo, building coalitions that center the experiences of the most marginalized. Organizations, too, must reassess how they evaluate candidates for hiring and promotion: Are hidden biases baked into the criteria used to measure competence? And how do these biases disproportionately affect women and people of color?\n\nMoving toward collective action\n\nImposter syndrome thrives in isolation, convincing women that they alone are flawed. But the solution lies in collective action. By addressing the systemic roots of competency checking, we can create workplaces where self-doubt doesn’t hinder potential, and no one is punished for their confidence or ambition.\n\nWhite women must recognize that their successes and burdens are intertwined with those of women of color. The fight against competency checking isn’t just about individual self-improvement; it’s a call to dismantle the systems of oppression that undermine all women in the workplace.\n\nIn the wake of the great DEI surge of 2020–2021 and the current collapse and retreat from creating more equitable workplaces, women of color—and particularly Black women—find themselves under attack, and in desperate need of support from true allies. To move forward, we must unmask the real villains and build a future grounded in solidarity, equity, and shared power.\n\nFrom the book QUALIFIED: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work by Shari Dunn.

        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

        "content": "On March 9, most people in the U.S. will set their clocks forward an hour, thanks to the start of Daylight Saving Time. But if President Donald Trump acts on what he’s said about the practice, Daylight Saving Time as we know it could change. Daylight Saving Time has long been controversial—most countries don’t participate in it, and many Americans have said they want to stop changing the clocks twice a year. Trump has expressed support for ending the practice, but recent efforts to do so have stalled, and only two states—Hawaii and most of Arizona—don’t participate in Daylight Saving Time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s what Trump has said about Daylight Saving Time, and what changes could potentially be on the horizon. Read More: When Do the Clocks Move Forward in the U.S.? Your 2025 Guide to Daylight Saving Time What has Trump said so far about Daylight Saving Time? On Dec. 13, 2024, Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social, “The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn’t! Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.” But more than a month into his presidency, Trump has yet to make any moves on the issue since his Truth Social post, and experts are a little unsure as to what changes could be coming. David Prerau, author of Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time and an expert on the topic, says there are three options. The first is to keep the existing system of changing the clocks twice a year; currently, most of America sets the clock forward an hour starting in March for Daylight Saving Time, and sets the clock back an hour starting in November for Standard Time. The second option is to make Daylight Saving Time permanent, and the third is to make Standard Time permanent.\n\n“[Trump] said it in a very short sentence without detail so it isn’t clear which of those he meant,” Prerau says. “Most people don’t even realize that there are two other options.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment seeking clarity on Trump’s plans for Daylight Saving Time. What would permanent Daylight Saving Time look like? Daylight Saving Time is meant to allow people to make use of the daylight in the evening during the warmer months. Making Daylight Saving Time permanent would mean advancing the clocks an hour for the entire year, so the sun would appear to rise and set an hour later, not just in the summer, but in the winter too, Prerau says. Lawmakers have tried to do this in the past. A bipartisan bill called the Sunshine Protection Act would have made Daylight Saving Time year-round, but the bill stalled, and was recently reintroduced by Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. Lawmakers who have expressed support for the bill argue that changing the clock twice a year is an inconvenient disruption.\n\n“I hear from Americans constantly that they are sick and tired of changing their clocks twice a year—it’s an unnecessary, decades-old practice that’s more of an annoyance to families than benefit to them,” Scott said in a Jan. 8 press release about reintroducing the Sunshine Protection Act. “I’m excited to have President Trump back in the White House and fully on board to LOCK THE CLOCK so we can get this good bill passed and make this common-sense change that will simplify and benefit the lives of American families.” Trump has previously indicated support for such a change, tweeting in 2019, “Making Daylight Saving Time permanent is O.K. with me!” Prerau says the U.S. government made Daylight Saving Time permanent before, in 1974, during an energy crisis. But the change was unpopular because the sun appeared to rise later in the morning, so many people were waking up and going to work or school in the dark. The permanent time change was repealed less than a year later. “We have tried that year-round Daylight Saving Time, and it proved very unpopular nationally,” Prerau says.\n\nRead More: The U.S. Tried Permanent Daylight Saving Time Before. Here’s What Happened Dr. David Kuhlmann, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and a sleep medicine doctor, says that while the AASM supports ending the seasonal time changes, it doesn’t support making Daylight Saving Time permanent. Rather, the academy has been advocating for making Standard Time permanent, arguing that it aligns best with our circadian rhythms and would be better for our health and safety. “[If we had permanent Daylight Saving Time] people would be waking up in darkness, and likely be going to work in darkness … versus being able to get up with the more natural rhythm of the sun,” Kuhlmann says. What would permanent Standard Time look like? Making Standard Time permanent would mean setting the clocks back an hour for the entire year, so the sun would appear to rise and set an hour earlier not just in the winter, but in the summer too.\n\nMany health and sleep experts support making Standard Time permanent because they say it would be better for our health. Kuhlmann says that toggling between Daylight Saving Time and Standard Time disrupts our sleep and circadian rhythm, which is associated with negative health effects. He points to studies that have found Daylight Saving Time to be associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and an increased risk of stroke and hospital admissions, among other impacts. He adds that the effects of the “circadian misalignment” from Daylight Saving Time don't just last for a few days after the clocks change, but for the entire eight months that we use Daylight Saving Time. Generally speaking, making Standard Time permanent would allow us to wake up with the sun year-round, Kuhlmann says, and so would be better aligned with our circadian rhythm and ultimately more beneficial for our health.\n\n“From a circadian alignment perspective … it’s really the only choice that’s healthy,” Kuhlmann says.\n\nPrerau says the cons of making Standard Time permanent are that, in the summer, many people would likely still be sleeping when the sun appears to rise earlier, and they wouldn’t get to take advantage of the daylight in the evening since the sun would appear to set earlier. Rather than changing the current practice, he suggests that officials improve messaging, such as through public service announcements, to help people better prepare for and anticipate the seasonal time changes. “The current system is really a compromise between those two possibilities and it’s actually, in my opinion, better than either one because you’re getting the best of both,” Prerau says.",

        "content": "The YouTube videos that changed the way we think about ourselves\n\n2 days ago Share Save Francis Agustin Share Save\n\nEstudio Santa Rita (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\n\nYouTube started out as an off-beat video sharing site. But at its 20th anniversary, the platform's content has fundamentally altered the way we think, feel and interact with each other.\n\nIn 2006, Time Magazine named its annual Person of the Year: you. \"Yes you,\" the magazine read. \"You control the Information Age. Welcome to your world.\" Its cover featured a mirror to reflect reader's image – emblazoned on a computer screen tuned to a site modelled after YouTube. It was just a year after YouTube's launch, but already, it had shifted our understanding of the role we would play in the coming era.\n\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. It's gone from a novel tool to an unshakable pillar of technological infrastructure. Some 2.5 billion people log on every month. The company says people who watch YouTube on their TVs consume a billion hours of video a day, to say nothing of time spent on the app and website. But as much as YouTube changed how we use the internet, it's had an equally significant impact on our offline lives.\n\n\"Not long ago virtually no one took YouTube that seriously,\" journalist Mark Bergen writes in his book Like, Comment, Subscribe. \"But in so many ways, YouTube had set the stage for modern social media, making decisions throughout its history that shaped how attention, money, ideology, and everything else worked online.\"\n\nYouTube videos have occupied a massive share of our collective consciousness, dictating what brings us together, what drives us apart, what makes us laugh, cry and cringe. \"All the dynamics of social media – of attention, fame, disrupting old school media – have mostly grown because of the financial model YouTube built,\" Bergen tells the BBC. Human nature itself has shifted in the last 20 years, and as seen in these five videos, YouTube would become a nexus point for the way we see ourselves and each other.\n\nEstudio Santa Rita To a large extent, YouTube set the standards for cultural and social norms on the internet (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\n\nCanon Rock: The dawn of online collaboration\n\nLong before the video stitching on TikTok or remixing on Instagram reels, there was Canon Rock, uploaded just 10 months after YouTube's founding. South Korean musician Jeong-Hyun Lim, known online as funtwo, sits in his bedroom with an electric guitar, his face hidden beneath a baseball cap and pixelated footage. A backing track plays the chords to Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D, and Lim joins in, his guitar work subdued in line with the 300-year-old piece. But Lim's playing grows more intricate until, about 40 seconds in, he launches into a blazing solo, fingers gliding across the fretboard.\n\nThe reaction was explosive. As the video racked up hits, around 900 users sent direct video responses to Canon Rock – big numbers at a time when uploading videos meant plugging in a digital camera – and thousands more posted their own covers of the song. In 2007, YouTube user Impeto uploaded a compilation of dozens of Canon Rock videos edited into one continuous track, almost as though the whole internet was playing along together. Deft musicianship wasn't new to the web, but the user participation was.\n\nCanon Rock created a \"reciprocity between artists\" that opened the door for people to see each other as creative partners, says Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University in the US. By democratising the creative process, YouTube created a melting pot for different communities with different interests and skills to make the internet their own.\n\nYouTube turns 20 For more on the world's biggest video platform, read our story on the YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know.\n\nIt helped inspire a new era of online collaboration, according to Jean Burgess, a digital media professor at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Videos like funtwo's weren't just a performance, Burgess says, they were an invitation, a \"showcasing of skill and the setting of standards for other players in the 'game' to attain or beat\".\n\nToday's video platforms bombard us with marketing partnerships and endless threads of political discourse. But the musicians behind Canon Rock represented a simpler time, where collaboration was not an economic or ideological proposition, but instead a space where online bedroom dwellers were learning to see each other as members of a global community, a project they were all embarking on together.\n\nEstudio Santa Rita The platform's cultural influence became so pervasive that some YouTubers were able to harness its tropes to manipulate each other (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\n\nlonelygirl15: What is Reality?\n\nEarly YouTube audiences will probably be familiar with the saga of Bree, better known by the username lonelygirl15. Her story began as a homeschooled girl posting simple videos about her daily life. But things took a bizarre turn when Bree discovered her family was involved with a strange religious cult. Over the weeks and months, the narrative grew more convoluted; Bree ultimately went on the run, investigating secret codes, eluding religious acolytes and fighting a sinister organisation.\n\nIt was all fiction, of course. But lonelygirl15's start was so mundane that many didn't question the story until the drama was too fantastic to ignore. \"Bree\" had an enigmatic realness – she was actively connecting with fans on MySpace and corresponding with journalists, and even the New York Times was still asking whether the series was truth or a hoax before the final episode. It sparked ferocious debate in online forums, with viewers picking apart everything from her narrative to the quality of her video production.\n\nAuthenticity doesn't really exist online – you're always a persona, even if you're not acting as one – Mark Bergen\n\n\"[Lonelygirl15] seemed to captivate so many, drawing people who maybe didn’t know what YouTube really was into the fold,\" says Duffy. \"The authenticity, the relatability, the vulnerability, the expressive sharing.\"\n\nBeyond satire, the series was a pointed effort to use the tropes and norms of social media to misguide the audience. It marked a major development on the internet, where some realised for the first time just how blurry the lines between fact and fiction had become, Duffy says.\n\nLonelygirl15 was a sea change for many users' relationships to each other, and it forced some people to examine the identities that they themselves were creating online, Bergen says. \"In some ways, the lonelygirl15 series was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"It was a clever commentary about the fact that authenticity doesn't really exist online – you're always a persona, even if you're not acting as one.\"\n\nIt raised questions about discerning truth on the web, and helped establish a new order where every post, no matter how innocuous, is subject to interrogation and distrust.\n\nEstudio Santa Rita LGBTQ+ YouTubers used the platform to advocate for their rights, and created a model for other members of the community to embrace their truest selves (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\n\nComing out videos: Our authentic selves\n\nIt's 2011. A young man sits in front of a map of the world. His hands and voice are shaky as he calls his father on the phone. The man is Randy Phillips, an airman in the US Air Force, and he is filming himself telling his dad that he is gay.\n\nPhillips ran a channel called \"AreYouSurprised\" detailing his life under the US's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy. In his previous videos, Phillips positioned the camera to keep his face just out of view, but hours after the 16-year policy was repealed, he was on full display. Phillips wasn't the only one. His post was an early example of the \"coming out\" video, a YouTube genre that became more and more influential as time went on.\n\n\"Watching real LGBTQ+ people share their own coming out journeys across platforms like YouTube definitely provided an opportunity for queer and transgender people all over the world to realise they were not alone,\" says Zach Eisenstein, director of communications at The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group. \"When YouTube was just starting up, I was a teenager figuring out my own identity,\" he says. \"It helped me exponentially as I navigated my own coming out journey.\"\n\nThe offline world was in the throes of change. It would be four years until the US Supreme Court legalised gay marriage, but following a global economic recession that highlighted growing inequality and shifting political climates, social attitudes were becoming more inclusive.\n\nTyler Oakley, one of the first major openly gay personalities on the platform, launched the \"Coming Out\" challenge in 2011, encouraging his audience and fellow creators to proudly share their sexual orientations and experiences. YouTubers like Hannah Hart, Ingrid Nilsen and singer Troye Sivan garnered a collective 2.8 million views on their coming out videos. Olympic diver Tom Daley came out in a 2013 video, receiving support from his fans and fellow athletes.\n\n\"People find creators that speak to them, and very often watch them and get to know them and trust them and are influenced by them in a way that no other platform touches,\" says Ben Relles, former head of comedy at YouTube and cofounder of the YouTube channel Barely Political. The way we present ourselves differs between coworkers, family, friends and strangers, but YouTube circumvented those social links. LGBTQ+ creators leveraged the relationships with their audiences to make it plain that people with different sexual identities did not just exist, they were no different than every other person.\n\n\"Through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the internet, social media has given people a unique ability to find safe and welcoming online communities – especially when they don’t feel accepted in their in-person ones,\" Eisenstein says.\n\nEstudio Santa Rita Users' contributions propelled YouTube until it became an inescapable part of our lives. Today, many feel uneasy about the behemoth they helped create (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\n\n'WHY I REALLY AM QUITTING SOCIAL MEDIA': When enough is enough\n\n\"This is for my 12-year-old self,\" begins Australian YouTuber Essena O'Neill in what she called her last ever YouTube video in 2015. Over the next 17 minutes, O'Neill broke down her decision to quit all social media and made a passionate plea to her followers to do the same. O'Neill's story took aim at the \"contrived\" reality of video and social media production, and its harmful effects on mental health. It was a sign of things to come.\n\n\"Running a channel is very much like running a treadmill,\" says Matt Koval, a filmmaker and YouTube's former head creator liaison. \"If you stop, if you get off the treadmill for a long period of time, your viewers are going to move on and start watching other people just by nature, and it can be difficult to come back.\" And many creators, even as far back as YouTube's early days, never did.\n\nQuitting videos have become a social media subgenre unto themselves in the past decade – people in the public eye realising that they've taken on too much, or that they need a break. But O'Neill's departure helped spark a broader conversation.\n\n\"People are so dismissive of influencers and creators,\" says Duffy. \"What creative workers experience really presages wider trends in the economy.\"\n\nIt wasn't just creators facing burnout online. In the early days, social media was sold as utopian opportunity, a place where people would come together to share ideas beyond the constraints of traditional gatekeepers. But as time went by, a new discussion emerged about social media's potentially addictive qualities and negative effects on our time, attention and mental health.\n\nThanks in part to a push from creators like O'Neill, who offered their own experience as a model, conversations about our own relationships to the internet began to shift. Ten years later, we've reached the point the point that officials describe social media as a full on public health crisis – but that shift in thinking hasn't been enough to keep people off the internet. Social media usage on YouTube and elsewhere is higher than ever, and these days, O'Neill herself is back online.\n\nA spokesperson for Google, YouTube's parent company, says the platform works hard to ensure it's providing a healthy and fulfilling network, both for creators and users who just come to watch. \"Each YouTube creator has a different definition of success, and we have support mechanisms in place and continue to build a community that allows creators to thrive based on their individual needs and business aspirations,\" the spokesperson says. \"We want creators to make their videos in a healthy, sustainable way, and creating engaging content should always take priority over producing a certain quantity of videos.\" YouTube has invested in a number of efforts to promote mental health among its users and across the globe.\n\nEstudio Santa Rita As YouTube's dominance grew, users became increasingly unhappy with how the company wielded power (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\n\nYouTube Rewind 2018: Why do we love to hate?\n\nMore people than ever were watching YouTube videos in the 2010s, with the site averaging one billion users a month by 2013, according to the company. But as YouTubers became more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, some of those feelings turned towards the platform itself.\n\nFor years, YouTube released an annual recap video looking back at the service's biggest cultural trends. What began as a one-and-a-half-minute round-up turned into big budget productions, bringing together a growing roster of notable creators and celebrities recreating viral moments set to remixed tracks of hit songs. It was a fairly well-received – until 2018.\n\nWithin a week, YouTube Rewind 2018 racked up over 10 million dislikes, making it the most-disliked YouTube post of all time. Critics panned the video, including the CEO of YouTube's own daughter, arguing the company was promoting a self-serving view of the platform geared towards its own corporate interests, one that glossed how people were actually using and responding to the service. \"The community, which was once celebrated by YouTube, no longer feels included in the culture YouTube wants to promote,\" reporter Julia Alexander wrote at the time. The speed and scope of the reaction was unlike anything the company had seen before.\n\n\"For a long time, YouTube has been pretty tolerant of its creators' and audiences' criticisms. I think that's the sort of atmosphere where it's totally permissible for the audience to get really mad at the company,\" says Bergen. But \"the company has never been great at reading the room\".\n\nDespite the criticism, YouTube maintains that it's an inclusive space built to allow its community to thrive and feel empowered. \"YouTube has not only democratized content, but democratized opportunity,\" a Google spokesperson says. \"At YouTube, we developed a comprehensive approach aimed to ensure we’re a video streaming platform for high-quality content.\" That includes a set of robust community guidelines, the spokesperson says, one the company works to apply equally to all users in order to combat the spread of harmful content and build a healthy environment that lets users flourish.\n\nRewind 2018 revealed a festering hostility that grew in the online space. \"There was a marked shift,\" Duffy says. In the earliest days, discussions about YouTube centered around the idea that it promoted a culture of positivity. YouTube's original slogan was \"Broadcast Yourself\" – creators and users saw the website as a project they were all working on together. But as time wore on, an adversarial tone erupted on the platform, Duffy says, and many started to feel the YouTube they helped build had become too powerful.\n\nThe biggest change, perhaps, was how people understood the role they played on the platform; once they were creating YouTube, but now, they were just using it.\n\n--\n\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

How the retro trend of \"getting your colours done\" made a comeback with personalised colour analysis on social media – and how your perfect colours can \"spark careers, conversations and connections\".\n\nDo you have cool or medium undertones? Does red brighten your skin or dull you down? Questions like these, that may not have crossed your mind before, are now prominent on social media, as users try to define their colour palettes. Colour analysis, once considered niche, has seen a surge in popularity, with appointments booked months in advance and apps including TikTok and Instagram flooded with tutorials on how to determine which colours suit you.\n\n\"Before I started offering online consultations, I had people fly in from around the world to see me,\" says Canadian image consultant and colour analyst Carol Brailey.\n\nCarol Brailey Colour analyst Carol Brailey says that clothing in neutrals and black are becoming less popular with her clients (Credit: Carol Brailey)\n\nSince Brailey launched her business back in 2012, and has done thousands of consultations. \"It appeals to people from all walks of life,\" she tells the BBC. \"There's everyone from 17-year-olds to those in their 70s – I find people are tired of gravitating towards black clothing.\"\n\nPeople cry because they've never seen themselves look so vibrant – I have witnessed people's lives change – Carol Brailey\n\nOn TikTok, Brailey's client transformations have gained millions of views, as has the hashtag #ColorAnalysis, which is often accompanied by filters allowing users to find their palette. But although this technology is new, the practice has been around for decades.\n\nColour analysis enjoyed a spell of popularity in the 1980s and early-90s, when \"getting your colours done\" meant visiting a professional colour consultant in person, and being assigned a particular set of hues – often based on a system of seasons – that suited you. Broadly speaking, spring meant bright and fresh colours, summer cool and light, autumn was burnt oranges and mossy greens, and winter was deep jewel tones. This surge in interest was largely thanks to the bestselling books Color Me Beautiful by Carole Jackson (which sold more than 13 million copies worldwide) and Color Me a Season by Bernice Kentner.\n\nHowever, it was in the early-1900s that seasonal colour theory was born in the studio of Johannes Itten, a Swiss painter and art professor. Itten noticed that some of his students' portraits looked more vibrant than others, a difference he attributed to colour. By analysing colours that \"harmonised\" well together, he developed the seasonal analysis tool still used today, grouping people into summer, autumn, winter or spring.\n\nBrailey puts the modern-day revival down to how visual we have become. \"Whether it's uploading Instagram pictures, recording TikTok content, or even Zoom meetings, we have become a very visual society.\"\n\nAfter her consultations, it's not unusual to see tears, she says. \"People cry because they've never seen themselves look so vibrant. In my years of being in the industry, I have witnessed people's lives change, with promotions and new jobs, because it starts a confidence boost.\"\n\nTabitha Lofts Tabitha Lofts learnt that she is \"cool toned\", and that cobalt blue suits her pale skin (Credit: Tabitha Lofts)\n\nTabitha Lofts didn't cry after her colour consultation, but she did opt to have a total makeover, dying her hair, switching up her make-up routine, and introducing colours to her wardrobe that she hadn't previously worn. \"I did the whole shebang\", she laughs, adding, \"I liked it, and I felt so different.\" Before her consultation, Tabitha thought she had a warm spring or summer palette, explaining, \"I was so sure that I was warm toned, because I burn in the Sun, but it was the complete opposite. I learnt I'm cool toned, suit silver jewellery, and my favourite colours weren't my colours at all. Now I wear lots of cobalt blue, a shade I'd never worn before.\"\n\nMore like this:\n\nFor Lofts, who is a nutritionist and content creator, colour analysis was a way of building confidence. \"I was quitting fake tan, as I was addicted, and relied on it to bring my outfits together,\" she says. \"It was confidence in a bottle, but I need to find it elsewhere.\" She described getting dressed and not \"understanding\" her skin tone, which is where she got the idea for the image consultation. \"The results really changed my mind about my pale skin. I used to think about it with negative connotations and assumed it made me look icy, but now I know I can be warm, even without warm visuals.\"\n\nTo those who are dismissive of colour analysis, Lofts, who lives in Dubai, admits it is not the be all and end all. \"Although I got a lot from it, I still wear colours that aren't in my palette. It's not a prescription.\"\n\nFlying colours\n\nGrowing up in Costa Rica, fashion designer and stylist Micah Lumsden has always gravitated towards bright colours, as she finds that wearing them lifts her mood. But it was an experience while at fashion school that made her want to better understand colour theory. \"We were studying colour analysis, and my skin tone wasn't understood by my teachers. I got several back-up consultations from other students, but there were so many misconceptions about dark skin,\" she tells the BBC. \"Comments like, 'Every black person looks good in red,' as well as the idea that 'those with darker skin look good in every colour'.\"\n\nIt was this lack of awareness that prompted Lumsden to launch styling consultancy Cocoa Styling. \"I started working with painters and make-up artists, the people who really understand colour theory.\" She now has clients around the world, and has noticed more male clients on her books. \"Guys do care about fashion,\" she says. \"I used to see one man per 10 clients, but now it's one per five.\"\n\nMicah Lumsden Stylist Micah Lumsden says that colour is the most important factor when choosing what to wear (Credit: Micah Lumsden)\n\nAs a stylist, she approaches wardrobes with colour at the forefront, rather than design. \"Most people will look good in a tailored blazer and T-shirt, but the personalisation of colour gives an outfit a special touch.\"\n\nColour analysis is often expensive, but Lumsden doesn't want that to be a deterrent. She's also sceptical of online colour-analysis filters being the answer. \"It's hard to give an unbiased reading of filters, and screens also reflect light.\"\n\nInstead, she suggests holding up items from around the home against your face, or going to a local craft store to buy felt patches. \"You can use blankets, cushions... whatever. Hold them up against your face in the mirror, and take a selfie. Once you've got a collection of selfies, place them next to each other and ask, do I look better with blue and purples? Or yellows and oranges? If it's the latter, you have a warm palette, if it's the former, you're probably cool.\"\n\nThere is a science to clothes changing your mood, your behaviour and people's perception of you – Ellie Richards\n\nWe know fashion runs in cycles, but many believe that knowing your personal palette could be a way to break up with fast fashion. \"Trends rotate so quickly, so knowing your best colours is a great way of harnessing what suits you and eliminating everything else,\" Ellie Richards tells the BBC. She's the founder of Nuude Studio in Queenstown, New Zealand, and approaches fashion through psychology. Colour, in her opinion, is the most important tool.\n\nMickey Ross Ellie Richards approaches fashion through psychology, and says that colour is a \"powerful tool\" (Credit: Mickey Ross)\n\n\"There is a science to clothes changing your mood, your behaviour and people's perception of you,\" she says. \"When you put on a colour that suits you, it's a powerful tool, because we're instantly more confident and aligned in personal identity.\"\n\nThe easiest way to see colour psychology in action, she says, is in films and TV series. \"If we look at Euphoria, for example, Cassie (played by Sydney Sweeney) is often dressed in light blue to show an angel-like innocence, whereas Maddy (played by Alexa Demie) dresses in more dark maroon tones to signify her influence.\"\n\nLook at some of the trending colours of 2025, and black doesn't feature. Instead, we're seeing bold cardinal reds, striking marigolds and dusty-rose pinks. According to Richards, we've entered an era of being \"bold\".\n\n\"The pandemic days of wearing grey sweats are over, and instead we've emerged seeking fun, playful looks.\" She cites social media as influencing our style, too. \"It's had a massive effect. On TikTok, creators need to stand out and they can do so by wearing bright, eye-catching colours. Those videos are seen by millions of people, and so it's normalised these bold looks.\"\n\nGetty Images Colour analysts claim that finding your perfect colour palette for your clothes can help increase self confidence and improve mood (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nRichards is passionate about the benefits of colour analysis. \"A deep understanding of personal style and colour can spark careers, conversations and connections,\" she says, acknowledging that it can be a little daunting at first, but advising the curious to start by adding colour little by little. \"One option is to wear muted shades of a colour, or accessories.\"\n\nDespite a colour consultation confirming that cobalt blue suits her best, Lofts still gravitates towards black. \"It's easy to wear,\" she says with a smile. \"But I'm trying to be more adventurous.\"\n\nAs a personal trainer, she sees plenty of online content pushing \"optimisation\" and \"being the best version of yourself\". She views colour analysis as part of that trend, but believes the most important thing is feeling comfortable in your own skin. \"Everyone is focused on self-improvement, and there's a vanity to it,\" she says. \"But it doesn't have to be serious. Experimenting with colour should be fun, playful, and free from judgement.\" She laughs. \"Even if you don't stick to your assigned palette.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Edwards knew the day would come, but he was hoping the club would get a little longer with Hayen at the helm.\n\nWhen, in the summer of 2022, an approach arrived from Club Brugge to take over their Under-23s, Club NXT, it proved impossible for Hayen to turn down.\n\n\"It was a little bit of a surprise,\" says Edwards. \"I wasn't expecting to have any dialogue with a club like Club Brugge.\"\n\nHayen stepped in as first-team assistant after Scott Parker was sacked in 2023, before getting his chance as interim manager when Ronny Deila left last March.\n\nThere, Hayen found former Sint-Truiden team-mate and ex-Liverpool and Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to confide in.\n\n\"When [Deila] stepped down with 10 games to go last season, Nicky stepped in and won nine of them and they came out of nowhere to win the league. That was a real statement,\" says Edwards.\n\nIt was during that run that Jan Mulder, the former Ajax and Anderlecht striker turned pundit, made a prediction for Hayen's future.\n\n\"Next year [he] will play a series of matches in the Champions League, attracting the attention of Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Bayern and Manchester,\" Mulder wrote in Humo, external in May 2024.\n\n\"Nasser Al-Khelaifi of Paris St-Germain also joins the fight for his signature at the last minute. Personally, I think that the great Nicky Hayen will replace Arne Slot from Zwolle as manager of Liverpool within two years.\"\n\nThe first part of Mulder's premonition has proven to be true - Hayen's Brugge beat Villa, Sporting and Sturm Graz in the group phase, as well as drawing with Juventus and Celtic.\n\nThe Belgian champions followed up by defeating Atalanta in both legs of their play-off for a 5-2 aggregate victory.\n\nPrior to that second leg in Italy, Hayen explained how before games he always talks to his mother, who passed away four years ago.\n\n\"What he has achieved in the Champions League is just incredible. Club Brugge over the years have had far better sides on paper, but he is getting an incredible tune out of them,\" says Edwards.\n\n\"He is a workaholic, fanatical and leads from the front. I guess that is why a lot of these younger players who are coming through are working so hard for him and having great success.\"\n\nHayen's brief tenure in Wales also set the platform for Haverfordwest's future. In 2023, under Tony Pennock, they qualified for Europe for the first time in 19 years and only the second time in their history, reaching the Europa Conference League second qualifying round.\n\n\"It's great for the club to be associated with someone like that,\" says Edwards.\n\n\"It seems like it is only the start for him. I would love for him to go on. I am sure there will be opportunities to manage even higher if he carries on.\n\n\"He is probably one of the hottest properties in Europe.\"",

        "content": "Wismar: The scenic German city that inspired a horror classic\n\n3 days ago Share Save Erin Levi Share Save\n\nTZ Wismar, Anibal Trejo (Credit: TZ Wismar, Anibal Trejo)\n\nMore than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\n\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\n\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\n\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past – the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\n\nTZ Wismar Plaques throughout Wismar commemorate the city's many Nosferatu filming locations (Credit: TZ Wismar)\n\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\n\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\n\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of Nosferatu to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\n\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgård, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\n\nFriedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau Stiftung Nosferatu enthralled (and terrorised) audiences when it was released in 1922 (Credit: Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau Stiftung)\n\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\n\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\n\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\n\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of Lübeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\n\nCarola Ferch A tour lets visitors follow towering Nosferatu-inspired papier-mache puppets through Wismar's medieval streets (Credit: Carola Ferch)\n\nIn Wismar, the city organised guided bat walks and the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselböck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets – it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\n\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\n\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre self-guided walking tour that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\n\nTZ Wismar, Christoph Meyer Wismar sits pretty on the southern tip of the Baltic Sea (Credit: TZ Wismar, Christoph Meyer)\n\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\n\nSet-jetting A 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to Lübeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims. Those who have seen Eggers' remake will also recognise Lübeck's soaring seven-spired skyline in the film's establishing shot – a view you can experience yourself from St Peter's tower.\n\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities. (The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\n\nTZ Wismar, Christoph Meyer Wismar's lovely harbour sets the scene for Nosferatu's culminating scene (Credit: TZ Wismar, Christoph Meyer)\n\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\n\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The 'King of Soca' Machel Montano’s guide to Trinidad and Tobago\n\n3 days ago Share Save Annie Daly Share Save\n\nNeil Berment (Credit: Neil Berment)\n\nSoca musician Machel Montano shares his recs for enjoying his home nation during Carnival season and beyond.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago, a twin-island nation in the southern Caribbean renowned for its annual Carnival celebration (3-4 March 2025), has far more to offer visitors than just massive parades.\n\nThe birthplace of soca (a musical genre blending calypso, African, Caribbean and South Asian rhythms), Trinidad and Tobago stuns with its incredible beaches, lush rainforests and diverse wildlife. But despite the islands' dynamic music and festival culture, locals' favourite pastime is liming – simply hanging out.\n\nMachel Montano is a Trinidadian musician whose fans have dubbed him the \"King of Soca”. His new album, One Degree Hotter, dropped on 25 February 2025, coming on the heels of his January 2025 performance on NPR’s Tiny Desk, where he made history as the first soca musician to take the stage. He has sold out multiple shows at New York City’s Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center.\n\nWe asked Trinidadian native and \"King of Soca\" Machel Montano for the best ways to lime on his home islands. \"We are an island country of party and style,\" says the award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and actor. \"We celebrate through struggles and strife and especially celebrate our joys. Everything is a reason to come together.\"\n\nNo matter which island you’re on (it’s about a three-hour ferry ride between the two), you can expect to feel a lively spirit. \"Trinidad and Tobago are two pieces of one puzzle but they give you different experiences… so you get the best of both worlds,\" says Montano. \"Trinidad is where you come to experience the Carnival culture and steelpan orchestras, while Tobago, with its blue water, white-sand beaches and relaxed attitude, is somewhere you can chill and unwind.\"\n\nLocal island culture reflects the country's history of colonisation. \"Our style developed through the cultural influences of Spanish, English, French, Dutch, Caribbean, African and Indo-Trinidadian communities interacting with each other over time… we really blur the lines of culture,\" Montano says. \"We are a 'douglarised’ nation, meaning we’re a true mix of African and Indian cultures. We don’t just live side by side; we share our food, fashion, music and traditions.\"\n\nHere are Montano's favourite ways to experience Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nGetty Images For some of the best home cooking in Trinidad and Tobago, Montano loves hitting the food stalls at the Breakfast Shed (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n1. Best culinary experience: Street food and the Breakfast Shed\n\nFor Montano, the best food in Trinidad and Tobago is found in the streets.\n\nTip: \"Hire a friendly driver to take you around for your whole stay,\" says Montano. \"When you’re liming, you never know how long you’re going to be in one place. The driver can always drop you off and wait around and spin back… they’ll take care of you. And they know all the best places to go.\" To make it happen, \"Just ask one of the regular taxi drivers, 'Hey, can you be our driver for our stay?’,\" advises Montano. \"Most of the time, you can find somebody here to do that.\"\n\n\"Our most famous street food, doubles [curried chickpeas served on two fried flatbreads, topped with condiments like mango chutney and tamarind sauce], is available on nearly every corner. It’s a food that [harks back to] our cultural roots. It’s affordable, tasty and something we're known for internationally.\" His pro tip: find a vendor selling fresh coconut water, as locals do. \"Coconut water is the perfect pairing with any meal!\"\n\nWhen pressed to name a sit-down dining experience, Montano cites the Breakfast Shed: \"You know when you’re looking for good food, you’re always looking for your grandmother’s cooking? We call it the Breakfast Shed, but it’s not really a shed. It’s what you would call a modern-day food hall. They cook only local dishes with what we like to call a 'sweet hand'; this means they use the best seasonings. Everything is so tasty.\"\n\nMontano recommends ordering the callaloo, which is a popular Sunday dish in Trinidad and Tobago. \"[It's] a mixture of bushes [dasheen bush, also known as taro leaves] with okra and spinach and all these different things in there.\" He also recommends trying traditional stews, curries, pies or plant-based ingredients like pigeon peas: \"We call those plant-based dishes 'ground food'. Healthy food.\"\n\nMontano especially loves people watching at the Breakfast Shed: \"There are a lot of people from every walk of life, from salespeople to shopkeepers to students. Everyone is always rolling up to the Breakfast Shed.\"\n\nAddress: JFXP+M8M, Wrightson Rd, Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago\n\nGetty Images Panyards are a communal rehearsal space for local steelpan bands, and music-loving visitors can drop by any time (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n2. Best for live music: Kafe Blue and any panyard\n\nMusic is a way of life in Trinidad and Tobago, whether you're catching a live soca performance or simply hanging out at a dive bar. Montano enjoys visiting Kafe Blue, a calypso jazz cafe in Port of Spain, also known as Kaiso Blues Café. \"It’s owned by one of our favourite musicians, Carl Jacobs, who was one of the biggest producers and singers in Trinidad and Tobago when I was growing up,\" he says. \"You can see some of the greatest musicians in Trinidad… people like Leston Paul, a great jazz musician. You can also see calypso and reggae there, and pop music and even gospel music… It's a nice place to hang out with people and chat.\"\n\nAnother classic musical experience is visiting a panyard, a communal rehearsal space for steelpan bands. \"Even though pan music [music played on the steelpan] is associated with Carnival, travellers can also come to the islands anytime and visit a panyard,\" says Montano. \"Some of them are not active during the year, but a lot of them are, like Renegades and All Stars and Invaders and Phase 2. You might pass and hear some calypso or some soca or even some classical music being played. You’ll hear all sorts of contemporary pop songs being played, too, because these bands tour the world.\" He adds: \"Nowhere else in the world would you be able to walk into an orchestral rehearsal and be a part of it and have a little lime.\"\n\nAddress: MF3J+JPQ, Wrightson Road, Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago Phone number: (868) 477-2262 Instagram: @kafeblue.tt\n\nGetty Images In a nation renowned for its spectacular beaches, Maracas Bay provides a tropical escape (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n3. Best beach: Maracas Beach\n\nTrinidad and Tobago is famous for its lush beaches, like Montano's pick; Maracas Beach, a tropical escape on Trinidad's north coast, about a 45-minute drive from Port of Spain through the leafy green Santa Cruz mountains; found in Maracas Bay.\n\nExperience both islands \"This is a very important tip!\" says Montano. \"The two islands are diagonal experiences. Trinidad is the hustle and bustle of the nation, and Tobago is where you kick back and relax.\" He recommends checking out Store Bay (a popular beach known for its turquoise waters and food vendors), and Nylon Pool (a crystal-clear lagoon in the middle of the sea) while you’re in Tobago. \"And be sure to eat some of that local cuisine while you’re at Store Bay,\" he says.\n\n\"It's surrounded by beautiful mountains and the breeze is cool, so it brings serenity to a lot of people,\" Montano says. \"The people watching is always a delight as well… people are always having fun there.\"\n\nHe also notes that it's one of the most popular spots on the islands to get bake and shark, an iconic Trinidadian street food sandwich made from fried shark and fried bread and topped with condiments ranging from cucumbers to pineapple to \"special things\" like shado beni (\"like a cilantro sauce\", Montano explains). There are multiple places to get it, Montano says, including Richard's Bake & Shark and Patsy's Bake & Shark. Just be sure to top it with whatever speaks to you most. \"Everyone has their own way of doing it,\" says Montano. \"It’s all about your personal preference.\"\n\nAlamy The Northern Range covers about 25% of the entire island of Trinidad (Credit: Alamy)\n\n4. Best for a nature adventure: the Northern Range\n\nHitting the beach isn’t the only way to commune with nature in Trinidad and Tobago. Montano recommends spending time in the Northern Range; a lush string of mountains running throughout northern Trinidad that covers about 25% of the entire island.\n\n\"There are amazing forest reserves, hiking trails and waterfalls there that offer a peaceful yet breathtaking experience,\" says Montano, who suggests paying close attention to the birds. There are more than 430 different species of birds in the Northern Range, not to mention more than 100 species of mammals including red howler monkeys, ocelots, and deer. “The Northern Range is really ideal for nature lovers,\" says Montano.\n\nGetty Images Brian Lara Promenade offers prime people watching – and a true glimpse of everyday Trinidadian life (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n5. Best for feeling the rhythm of everyday life: Brian Lara Promenade\n\nAlso known as Independence Square, the street vendor- and busker-lined Brian Lara Promenade runs through Port of Spain’s downtown area and is a fun spot to sit and people watch. \"It’s named after one of our most famous cricketers and is always buzzing with people,\" says Montano.\n\nOnce you’ve absorbed the rhythms of Trinidadian life, Montano suggests strolling to Queen’s Park Savannah, a 260-acre urban park. \"You’ll see lots of joggers, food vendors and the 'Magnificent Seven' [a group of seven colonial mansions],\" Montano says. \"[It's] a great mix of daily life and cultural heritage.\"\n\nGetty Images Carnival is Trinidad and Tobago's most famous – and colourful – cultural festival (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n6. Best cultural experience: Carnival\n\nCarnival is \"the heart and soul of our culture\", says Montano, so make it a point to visit while it's happening – traditionally the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. \"Visitors can play mas (join in with a costume), meet incredible people, taste authentic local foods and immerse themselves in music and dance. It’s a full spectrum of art, expression and unity that showcases the creativity of our people.\"\n\nTo make the most of Carnival, Montano suggests heading to Trinidad and Tobago one week before the big celebrations and making sure to wear festive attire. \"The parties start the [week] before Carnival Monday, and continue every night right into J’ouvert,\" he explains. Known as the kick-off to Carnival, J’ouvert is a lively celebration that begins before sunrise on Carnival Monday morning in which partygoers dance through the streets covered in paint and mud and other substances. To do it right, wear clothes you don’t mind ruining, advises Montano. \"It’s the most fun to be dabbed in paint and powder and sometimes even chocolate,\" he says. \"Then you go home around 06:00 or 07:00, take a shower, take some rest and get back out on the road for what we call 'Monday Wear', which is when you usually wear a designer swimsuit and a little bit of your Tuesday costume.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, revellers dress up \"proper\" with feathers, beads and other \"fancy-looking, bright-looking, colourful-looking costumes,\" says Montano. Whatever you do, he advises, be wary of heels. \"You want to wear flats, because it’s all about jumping and waving and dancing. And having fun.\"\n\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'Something stirring beneath the surface': What eight ghostly portraits found hidden inside masterpieces reveal\n\n22 February 2025 Share Save Kelly Grovier Share Save\n\nThe Courtauld Institute of Art\n\nIn the past month alone, shadowy portraits have been found hidden in longstanding masterpieces by Titian and Picasso. What can they and other such discoveries tell us?\n\nSomething's stirring. Every few weeks, it seems, brings news of a sensational discovery in the world of art – of paintings hidden under other paintings and vanished visages twitching beneath the varnish of masterpieces whose every square millimetre we thought we knew. This past month alone has brought to light the detection of mysterious figures trapped beneath the surface of works by Titian and Picasso. But what are we to make of this slowly swelling collection of secret stares – these absent presences that simultaneously delight and disturb?\n\nIn early February, it was revealed that researchers at the Andreas Pittas Art Characterization Laboratories at the Cyprus Institute, using advanced imaging and a new multi-modal scanner combining different techniques, had proved the existence of an upside-down portrait of a mustachioed man holding a quill beneath the Italian Renaissance master Titian's painting Ecce Homo, 1570-75. On its surface, Titian's canvas portrays a bedraggled Jesus, hands bound by ropes, standing shoulder to shoulder with a sumptuously dressed Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who will sentence him to death. What is this strange, erased, anachronistic scribe doing here and what is he trying to tell us?\n\nThe Cyprus Institute Titian, Ecce Homo, 1570-75 (Credit: The Cyprus Institute)\n\nThe presence of the hidden portrait, who peers imperceptibly through the craquelure – those alluring cracks in old master paintings – was first described by the art historian Paul Joannides and its significance to the surface narrative is more than incidental. While the identity of the topsy-turvy figure has yet to be determined, it is clear he helped shape the wrenching composition under which he has been buried for the past 450 years. The analysis of the materiality of the painting's layers in Cyprus has shown that the contours of the hidden figure's face dictated the curve of ropes binding Jesus's hands – establishing notes of harmony between the successive and seemingly contrary compositions.\n\nThat sense of quiet collaboration between layers of paint – between what is there and what used to be there – is more striking still in the hidden countenance of a woman found by conservators at The Courtauld Institute of Art beneath a painting from Pablo Picasso's Blue Period – a portrait of the artist's friend and sculptor Mateu Fernández de Soto. Also discovered with the use of infrared imaging technology, the portrait of the as-yet unidentified woman is rendered in an earlier, more impressionistic style, and appears, when brought to the surface, to be whispering into de Soto's ear, as if the past and present had merged into a single suspended moment.\n\nThe Courtauld Institute of Art Pablo Picasso, Portrait of Mateu Fernández de Soto, 1901 (Credit: The Courtauld Institute of Art)\n\nIn most instances, these buried portraits are merely the ghosts of rejected compositions that we were never intended to see – and could not have, were it not for the aid of advanced imaging tools that allow experts safely to peer beneath the paint without harming a work's surface. X-rays uncover hidden sketches, while infrared reflectography is capable of exposing subtle details masked by old varnish – details which, once glimpsed, are impossible to unknow. Once revealed, these portraits demand to be reckoned with. What follows is a short survey of some of the most intriguing and mysterious portraits – very often self-portraits – found wriggling restlessly beneath familiar masterpieces: unsettling presences that remain forever immeasurably close and worlds away.\n\nRembrandt's Old Man in Military\n\nJ Paul Getty Museum\n\nThink of Rembrandt and we tend to think first of that dim, imperishable realm in which his sitters sit outside of time – an eternal stage crafted from charcoal and sombrous umber. What we don't think of is giddy greens and garish vermilions igniting the space with vibrancy and verve. But that is exactly what researchers found staring back at them when they subjected the Dutch master's painting, An Old Man in Military Costume, to macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) imaging and infrared reflectography. Trapped beneath Rembrandt's meditation on mortality, a giddy ghost of jaunty youth clad in raffish reds and incorrigible verdigris intensifies the poignancy of his masterwork.\n\nArtemisia Gentileschi's Saint Catherine of Alexandria\n\nNational Gallery, London\n\nWith some paintings, the more we see the less we know. Take Artemisia Gentileschi's portrait of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, 1619. X-ray analysis of the Italian Baroque artist's work undertaken in 2019 revealed that she began the work as a self-portrait – one that closely resembles an earlier, and similarly entitled, Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, begun around 1615. Disentangling the two works' faces is tricky but scholars now think that the final work – which swaps a turban for a crown and a piercing stare for a pious, heavenly gaze – blends elements of the artist's own likeness with those of Caterina de' Medici, daughter of the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici, who commissioned the work. The result is proof that while an artist may be able to let go of a painting, a painting can never completely let go of the artist.\n\nCaravaggio's Bacchus\n\nGetty Images\n\nCaravaggio only signed one painting during his lifetime and did so with ghoulish flair in a squiggle of blood at the bottom of the largest painting he ever made, The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, 1608. But that is hardly the only time the Italian master inserted a semblance of himself into his paintings. In 2009, scholars using advanced reflectography penetrated the cracked surface of Caravaggio's depiction of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, to rehabilitate a tiny self-portrait that he had secreted in the reflection of the carafe (an almost subliminal detail that clumsy restoration efforts had obscured after the portrait-within-a-portrait was first discovered in 1922). This strange, distorted, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't selfie in the vessel of wine is key to the work's meaning, amplifying as it does themes of drunken illusion and elastic identity that are central to Caravaggio's painting.\n\nSeurat's Young Woman Powdering Herself\n\nThe Courtauld Gallery\n\nOn the surface, Young Woman Powdering Herself is a playful meditation on how subject and style overlap. Here, Georges Seurat employs his pioneering pointillist technique of countless tiny dots to depict his mistress, Madeleine Knobloch, as she scatters her own flurry of powdery specks across her face. The dabs of paint seem to swirl in the air, all but clogging it – metaphorically powdering, too, anyone who stops to stare. These deftly deployed dabs of paint reveal and erase in equal measure, as if conjuring a world only to blot it out again. That sense of brilliant obliteration is intensified with the discovery of a hidden self-portrait – Seurat's only known one – in the open window which he later concealed beneath another flurry of dots depicting a vase of flowers. How dotty is that?\n\nModigliani's Portrait of a Girl\n\nAlamy/Oxia Palus (Credit: Alamy/Oxia Palus)\n\nSome people refuse to be forgotten, no matter how hard you scrub them from your memory. Italian modernist Amedeo Modigliani's famous Portrait of a Girl, 1917, is a compelling case in point. Some scholars suspect that the full-length portrait of a woman, concealed beneath the visible image, may depict an ex-lover with whom Modigliani ended a relationship a year earlier. In 2021, two PhD candidates at the University of London used Artificial Intelligence to reconstruct this hidden portrait, which strikingly resembles Modigliani's former muse and mistress, Beatrice Hastings. While the identity of both women, surface and hidden, remains uncertain, the layering reinforces themes of concealment and masking in Modigliani's work.\n\nRené Magritte's La Cinquième Saison\n\nMusées Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique\n\nIn his painting La Cinquième Saison, 1943, René Magritte portrays in profile two nearly identical men in dark suits and bowler hats – props that often signal the presence of his alter-ego in the artist's work. Both men hold small, framed paintings under their arms as they walk towards each other. The trajectory of their strides suggests not so much an imminent collision as a near miss – an eclipse, as one figure and painting slips behind the other. It somehow seems fitting that this painting – this painting of shuffling paintings – has been found, with the use of infrared reflectography, to be hiding under its surface another painting altogether: a portrait of a mysterious woman, who at once bears a strong resemblance to the artist's wife, Georgette, and has features that are wholly distinct. The discovery of the hidden portrait merely amplifies themes of riddling duality in the work of an artist known for his treacherously teasing images.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

I visit this tiny wedge of parkland on the west coast of Scotland, just across the bridge from the Isle of Skye, on a rainy day in late September, and park ranger Heather Beaton and I spend the afternoon wandering around its various ecosystems-in-miniature.\n\nWe clamber over rocks at one of its little hidden natural harbours. We freeze as black darter dragonflies land on her pink shoe by a pond. And we bend to peer at circles of huge mushrooms which have sprung up overnight in its tiny woodland.\n\nAll of these habitats had fallen into serious disarray until a few years ago – most of this area used to be a golf course – Heather Beaton\n\nA wildflower meadow, ponds, scrub habitat, coastline and even an area of peat bog can be found on this little 60-acre (24-hectare) plot, which boasts roe deer, otters, lizards, eels and a huge array of insects and birds. \"We do describe it as a microcosm of Scotland,\" says Beaton. \"If you think of all of the major habitats of Scotland, we've got them here on the Plock, just in miniature.\" It's an impression she works to cultivate. \"The more little pockets we have, the more chance a person has to... end up having a nature experience,\" she says.\n\nAll of these habitats had fallen into serious disarray until a few years ago, says Beaton. In fact, most of this area used to be a golf course.\n\nThe Plock is part of a small but significant global trend of land once used for golf being turned back over to nature. From California to Pennsylvania and Australia to Canada, these projects are reaping in some big rewards for both biodiversity and local people.\n\nBut what does it take to rewild a golf course? Could this be a key to both supporting biodiversity and helping more people get the immense benefits that come with interacting with nature? And what do we win – and lose – in the process?\n\nJocelyn Timperley Plock ranger Heather Beaton the ex-golf course as a 'microcosm' of Scotland due to its many varied mini habitats (Credit: Jocelyn Timperley)\n\nHuge swathes of land are used for golf. According to one recent study, many countries across the world, including the UK and the US, use far more land for golf courses than they do for wind or solar energy. The US has the most courses of any country by far: its 16,300 golf courses occupy an estimated 8,000 sq km (2 million acres), an area around a third of the size of Vermont.\n\nGolf emerged as a sport in my home country of Scotland in the 15th-17th Centuries, and for a time was relatively widely played, with courses often shared spaces used for walking and other activities as well as golf. Over the last century or so, however, it has widely emerged as the sport of the most affluent in society.\n\nIf you can imagine little nursery kids, so you're talking three, four year olds coming along and planting a wee tree with a spade. When they're 20, this is going to be a woodland – Heather Beaton\n\nLuxury hotels and golf clubs have sprung up across the world, sometimes damaging precious ecosystems in the process. In just one example, in 2017 a golf course built by now US president Donald Trump in Aberdeenshire was found by a Scottish government watchdog to have \"destroyed” the sand dune system it was built on, causing permanent habitat loss and loss of its status as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). Responding to a request for comment about these criticisms, Sarah Malone, executive vice president of Trump International, Scotland, called the reports \"inaccurate and grossly misleading\".\n\n\"Nature Scot [Scotland's conservation body] ignored and neglected the dunes under the previous ownership and have barely set foot on this site over the past 20 years,\" she said. \"Their own assessment acknowledged that many attributes of the SSSI – which was, in fact, less than 3% of our vast estate – had flourished since the first golf course was completed in 2012. Trump International's ongoing investment and care of the land is beyond question, as anyone who actually visits the property will attest.\"\n\nA separate proposal for an 18-hole golf course on another fragile Scottish dune sand ecosystem continues to divide public opinion.\n\n\"Certainly, some of the key environmental concerns with golf over time have involved pesticide spraying, the quantity of water used, especially in times of drought, and the significant amount of land sometimes needed for a golf course,\" says Brad Millington, associate professor of sport management at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, and co-author of The greening of golf.\n\nJocelyn Timperley Vegetation now surrounds what used to be the first tee at The Plock (Credit: Jocelyn Timperley)\n\nThe environmental impact of golf has also developed over time, Millington adds, as humans have developed the capacity to build golf courses \"seemingly just about anywhere\", no matter the type of land.\n\nGolf has increasingly become a target for environmental activists. Brazilian activists camped out on a highway in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the 2016 Olympics, to protest the city's decision to build a new course on an area of environmental protection. In 2022, climate activists in France filled golf course holes with cement to protest an exemption from water bans amidst a severe drought. In 2024, Extinction Rebellion activists disrupted the Travellers Championship, a golf competition in Connecticut, spraying coloured smoke and powder and sporting t-shirts reading, \"No golf on a dead planet\".\n\nSome anti-golf movements completely reject golf, a view that's become common to see on social media in recent years. But the overall impact of any individual golf course depends on a huge array of factors, says Millington: the amount of non-recycled water and pesticides used in maintenance, for example, and what was there before the golf course was built in the first place.\n\nFrom an environmental standpoint, it's also worth considering what else the land might be used for. Land disused for golf can end up being developed for housing or commercial ventures. And while building housing is important for many other reasons, concreting over part of the land may well not improve the environmental profile of an ex-golf course, leading some to argue brownfield sites should be used instead.\n\nThe land covered by golf courses in the US fell by 12% between 2005 and 2021\n\nDuring the decades that the Plock was a golf course, meanwhile, some of its natural habitats remained. Most of the woodland here is natural, and the peat bog, while deliberately drained by golfers, also survived, based on the depth of peat, which accumulates very slowly, Beaton estimates it could be over 1,000 years old.\n\nPreviously used for farming, the Plock was never a high-end golf course: it first opened for the community in the 1920s by the local lord and lady, says Beaton, and after various ups and downs the course eventually petered out in the mid 2000s. For a time the land was left largely to its own devices. In 2019, the trust which owned the land passed it to the local Kyle of Lochalsh Community Trust, which opted for it to become parkland. \"It was just overgrown and abandoned and just unloved, really severely unloved,\" says Beaton. \"A lot of effort has gone into bringing it back.\"\n\nThe main green, previously kept short and highly manicured for golf, had become a dense area of tussocky grass. Now it is managed as a permanent wildflower meadow with over 80 species of flowering plant, from native orchids to pignuts and goldenrods, and heaves with butterflies and other insects. \"In the height of summer, it is just beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful,\" says Beaton.\n\nJocelyn Timperley The Plock includes several small natural harbours where people can swim in the sea or enjoy the view (Credit: Jocelyn Timperley)\n\nMany of the golf tees, meanwhile, have been reclaimed by scrub and will, in time, naturally become woodland, says Beaton. Fresh water is being brought back, supporting its new otter population. The peatland is being rewetted, a measure which can stunt carbon emissions and bring back species.\n\nBeaton, who is in her mid-30s, clearly has an unbridled affection for the Plock. She grew up on a farm in the Scottish borders and previously worked as a warden on Uist in the Outer Hebrides, before moving to Kyle of Lochalsh in 2021 to start work as one of the Plock's two rangers. \"We just work away to make it as good a place as possible for all the visitors and users, whether human or wildlife,\" she says.\n\nThe struggle, as always, is money. The transformation of the Plock has largely been supported by grants. The trust has explored other options: charging for scything training, a secondhand shop and community facilities, including a laundrette it runs in the village. But it will need something larger scale to become self-sustaining, says Beaton: likely some kind of onsite tourist accommodation. It also hopes to build a traditional-build longhouse to use as a small museum, ticketed for tourists. \"I think the sustainable income is going to be the big challenge,\" says Beaton. \"How we approach that, how we develop that, that is going to be the big question.\"\n\nYou can make a golf course in lots of places… but you can't make something like this – William Roe\n\nMagical as it is, the Plock is certainly miniscule. But it's not an isolated example of an ex-golf course being repurposed for nature. Projects are springing up in Scotland, the wider UK as well as across the Atlantic in the US and Canada.\n\nIn 2018, The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a US non-profit, bought the 157-acre (64-hectare) San Geronimo Golf Course in California and set about creating a new commons and restoring its wildlife and streams. At the time, the golf course was likely one of the top 10 water users in Marin County, says Erica Williams, who led the TPL's work on the park.\n\nSan Geronimo Golf Course was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a climate-resilient ecosystem\", says Williams, by reconnecting the property's creeks and waterways as well as recreating its historic floodplain.\n\nThe trust opened pathways to the public and stopped irrigating the land. It worked with partners to restore the ecosystem of the endangered coho salmon. \"The 2024 spawning season brought record numbers of spawning salmon to the San Geronimo Valley watershed, particularly to Larsen Creek,\" says Williams. Hundreds of species have been spotted in the park: everything from deer, coyote and bobcats to native egrets, ducks and hawks, along with dozens of native plant species.\n\nTrust for Public Land The Trust for Public Land restored rivers in San Geronimo golf course, resulting in record numbers of spawning salmon in 2024 (Credit: Trust for Public Land)\n\nWhile some people did experience the loss of the golf course, many residents and users have expressed \"their deep gratitude for this beautiful now publicly accessible landscape\", says Williams. \"Overall, the public reaction has been quite positive,\" she says.\n\nIn August 2024, the TPL transferred ownership of the San Geronimo Golf Couse, now known as the San Geronimo Commons, to the local government, including land set aside for a future fire station. The TPL has used a similar model of restoration and transfer to public ownership with several other golf courses, usually ones that were becoming financially unviable, says Williams.\n\nIn fact, snapping up golf course land for rewilding in the US makes a lot of sense, because the land covered by golf courses has been decreasing for decades, falling by 12% between 2005 and 2021. \"Given the climate crisis, there's a good case to use [this land] to address problems such as biodiversity loss,\" says Millington.\n\nGolf course properties are often large, adds Williams, and by design often built within larger natural landscapes near natural features, such as creeks and streams. \"They are often relatively flat, with cart paths and trails that allow for public access.\" Long broad golf course airways can present a unique opportunity for wildlife corridors, she adds. Plus, they tend to consume a lot of water, meaning rewilding can help with significant water conservation.\n\nIn fact, in the US fertiliser and water use in golf have substantially decreased in recent decades – in part due to course closures, but largely due to management changes.\n\nNaturalised areas, sections of the golf course that aren't so heavily maintained, have also been on the rise. In 2015 survey, 46% of US golf courses said they had increased the land dedicated to naturalised areas over the past decade, with just 5% saying they had decreased it.\n\n\"This can be done to reduce maintenance costs but there can be an environmental angle as well, such as enabling wildlife to flourish,\" says Millington.\n\nHowever, while many golfers support wilding efforts on non-play areas, there can be trade offs in terms of playability of having more dense vegetation around.\n\nJocelyn Timperley Golf courses that are being made a little wilder can offer lessons for other types of land as well, says Plock ranger Heather Beaton (Credit: Jocelyn Timperley)\n\nGolf courses that are being made a little wilder can offer lessons for other types of land as well. \"I do think there's ways of introducing nature into manicured landscapes,” says Beaton. \"You can do it in cities, you can do it in any sort of any land.\"\n\nBecause ultimately, what managers of many rewilded golf courses tend to emphasise is the benefit to local people. At San Geronimo, people from across the San Francisco Bay Area come to hike, bike, walk their dogs and ride horses, says Williams. \"One thing that is absolutely wonderful to see is the multigenerational use, made possible by the property's gentle terrain. I've seen family members, young and old, walking together on the land.\"\n\nCarbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 3.8kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nAt the Plock, nestled helpfully close to the town of Kyle of Lochalsh, paths now wind through the tightly knit ecosystems, many of them disabled-friendly. The Plock runs guided walks, a mental health support group and scything classes (useful for locals with big gardens or crofts who want to cut away overgrown bracken).\n\nIt also hosts groups of local schoolchildren, who sometimes help with restoration efforts. \"If you can imagine little nursery kids, so you're talking three, four year olds coming along and planting a wee tree with a spade,\" Beaton says of one recent visit. \"And then I had to come back afterwards and just make sure they were properly in the ground. But you know, they did that. When they're 20, this is going to be a woodland.\"\n\nLeaving the Plock after my walk with Beaton, I meet William Roe, a local who comes here to walk his two Hungarian vizsla dogs almost every day. I ask him whether it’s a shame to have lost the golf course, but he shakes his head. \"You can make a golf course in lots of places… but you can't make something like this.\" There are oak trees here, he adds, that are more than 200 years old. \"And that just tells you that this place has been special for a long time, and I hope it will be forever more,\" he says.\n\nJocelyn Timperley is a senior reporter for BBC Future.

        "content": "The little bug with a big appetite turning organic waste into sustainable fertiliser\n\n4 February 2025 Share Save Miranda Lipton Share Save\n\nChapul Farms (Credit: Chapul Farms)\n\nThese tiny soldiers can eat four times their own weight in organic waste – and turn it into sustainable fertiliser.\n\nWith a unique ability to consume nearly any form of organic matter it comes across, one small but mighty insect is becoming a tool to address the growing problem of organic waste and soil degradation. The bug, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), transforms food waste into nutrient-rich biofertiliser: frass.\n\nInsects have been long been used in agricultural practices as a food source – but now farmers are exploring the potential of bug poo as a sustainable fertiliser. With over 33% of the world's soil currently degraded, depleted of the nutrients necessary for healthy plant growth, frass can play a major role in restoring soil biodiversity and quality.\n\nIn May 2024, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded grants to three projects that seek to harness this soldier fly's capabilities. This included Chapul Farms, an Oregon-based project development company that's reweaving insects back into American agriculture to eliminate food waste, restore soil health, and produce high-quality animal feed.\n\nBacked by the Fertilizer Production and Expansion Program (FPEP), the bipartisan support of the use of insects in agriculture highlights the growing recognition of BSFL's potential – for both waste reduction and for enhancing soil health through the production of high quality domestic fertiliser.\n\nBut despite the bug's seeming superpowers, the widespread application of BSFL remains limited. The question is: why? And how can companies like Chapul Farms, now equipped with federal support, change that?\n\nChapul Farms Black soldier flies reproduce quickly and the larvae can survive on waste food (Credit: Chapul Farms)\n\nBSFL can consume nearly any kind of organic waste, from food scraps to agricultural byproducts. Facilities like Chapul Farms utilise its voracious appetite to process large quantities of waste, with the larvae consuming up to four times their own body waste in organic matter everyday. This happens in a fraction of the time required for traditional composting, which can take up to 10 months. The larvae's efficiency allows for a rapid turnover of organic material into nutrient-rich excrement – or frass.\n\n\"They can reproduce pretty quickly too,\" says Shankar Ganapathi Shanmugam, Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at Mississippi State University. \"And it [BSFL] grows on dead and decaying material, which means that it can survive on waste.\"\n\nShanmugam is spearheading research on the use of frass as a crop nutrient, which until now has not been studied in the US – though it has been studied in other parts of the world, notably in multiple countries across Europe.\n\nChapul collaborates with neighbouring farms to exchange waste for frass, creating a circular system. It's a mutually beneficial exchange as the farms receive nutrient-rich soil amendment and Chapul receives the fuel for their operation. And it's doing something significant for insect populations too: helping to repopulate them.\n\nThis is because insect farming operations create a controlled environment for the bugs to thrive. The frass created from them provides essential nutrients to plants and fosters a more biodiverse soil, which encourages the growth of native plant and insect species, thus supporting the overall ecosystem.\n\nCarbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\n\"We could make compost out of anything but the impact of running it through this insect biology has all of these [positive] implications,\" says Mimi Casteel, an Oregon wine farmer who has been using Chapul's frass. \"It's exciting for so many reasons: it's a portable, pretty low cost investment compared to some other things that we're considering as part of dealing with our massive problems with waste, and soldier flies are replacing a missing layer of diversity.\"\n\nChapul has worked with local vineyards, researchers and farms to research, educate and promote frass benefits and adoption in the bioregion. TAINABLE, a local soil restoration non-profit, provides laboratory space and farmland to Chapul for their research.\n\nAs organic waste production continues to place a massive burden on energy and carbon emissions, there is an increasing need for more efficient and sustainable processing methods. And BSFL's digestive processes can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"Finding a use for this is important, but if you're going to market frass as a fertiliser, you need to regulate it, which takes time,\" says Shanmugam. \"And to make these regulations you need research.\"\n\nThe US National Organic Program does not include insects as an acceptable additive as of now. This makes it a challenge to share this technique with farmers who use organic practices, though teams like Chapul Farms are in conversations with regulators to increase education around it and usher in its inclusion.\n\nGetty Images The frass from black soldier fly larvae can help restore soil health (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nUnlike chemical fertilisers, which often deplete soil over time, frass promotes biodiversity within the soil by introducing a diverse microbial community. This boosts soil resilience, natural plant defence, improves its ability to retain water, and reduces the need for costly synthetic inputs. In sharp contrast, synthetics can wreck soil biodiversity, beneficial bacteria and the soil's natural micro-ecosystem, leaving it dependent on increasingly expensive inputs. They also have intensive fossil-fuel requirements, and reduce soil's carbon carrying capacity.\n\n\"We recently saw even more of a push for our government to get projects funded that support domestic fertiliser production,\" says Aly Moore, Chief Communications Officer of Chapul Farms. \"We realise how many health issues are caused by the reduced nutrient density in crops, and all the pesticides used. And on the cost factor, farmers will not only need less fertiliser over time, but also fewer pesticides.\"\n\nThe microbes in frass proliferate over time, rebuilding soil health\n\nThis can all contribute to cost savings and be more incentive for farmers, especially at a time when fertiliser prices are sky high and supply is unreliable. Prices more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. With the US being the world's third-largest fertiliser importer, American farmers felt the brunt of this impact; making it not just a fertiliser issue, but also one of food security.\n\n\"In the two years leading up to 2023, there was an 8% reduction in global fertiliser consumption, because people were priced out of the market,\" says Michael Place, Chief Technology Officer at Chapul Farms. \"There were supply disruptions and even unavailability. And FPEP emerged from this sort of emergency.\"\n\nSoil microbes present an exciting frontier for regenerating soil health, yet less than 1% of total microbes in soil have been cultivated. Frass provides an opportunity to pivot from the reductionist methods of treating soils that perpetuated the soil crisis in the first place, all while bolstering food and agricultural security.\n\nFarmers will eventually need less frass to maintain the same levels of soil productivity, as the microbes in frass proliferate over time, rebuilding soil health and resiliency by improving biodiversity.\n\nFarmers who have begun using frass in their fields are already reporting promising results. Casteel is in the midst of facilitating trials to assess the impact of frass on her crops. While the statistical outcome of the study is still in progress, she has already witnessed perceptible changes.\n\n\"Anecdotally, what I can tell you is that in the trials that I've done both with grapevines and in my vegetable farm, the produce itself comes up faster, it has better cellular structure,\" says Casteel. \"So if you actually cut the leaf and put it under the microscope, the cells grow more densely and they have figure lipid membranes. And what that means is that the plant from day one has more structural integrity,\" she says.\n\nThe FPEP funds will support construction and equipment for BSFL facilities located in Oregon and North Dakota. The projects anticipate yielding 10,000 tons of frass per location per year and will generate 59 new jobs, upon its opening which is expected to be in 2026.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the nascent insect agriculture industry is the tunnel vision around insects for protein production which has overshadowed the benefits of frass in soil health. While protein from BSFL is a lucrative and fast-growing market, frass remains an underutilised resource in insect agriculture.\n\nGetty Images It is early days, but some farmers across the world are starting to see the benefits of using BSLF frass as fertiliser (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe global insect protein market was valued at nearly $1 billion in 2022 (£805m), while global frass was valued at $96 million (£77m) in 2023, and frass's projected growth is substantially higher. Plus, according to the Chapul Farms team, insect farms produce twice as much frass as larvae.\n\n\"I think farmers have historically been convinced that insects are problems, and they just don't want to talk about adding more problems to their situation,\" says Casteel. \"But when our farms become more complex, you start to see an exponential rollout of ecological returns.\"\n\nIn addition, insects are keystone species, meaning entire ecosystems would drastically change or collapse without them – and our world would \"grind to a halt\", as the biologist Dave Goulson wrote in the Guardian newspaper.\n\n\"Ultimately, at its core, we cannot survive without insects,\" says Pat Crowley, CEO of Chapul Farms. \"Natural ecosystems cannot flourish... without the insects as a part of them. And that's one of our biggest premises. It's not as simple as: insects will solve the biggest trends in global agricultural health. And at the same time, I think it's one of the biggest levers that we have in making agriculture a more resilient, ecosystem-based model.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

        "content": "Is there no such thing as Italian cuisine?\n\n4 days ago Share Save Thomas Fabbri Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nItalian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world – often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\n\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity – so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\n\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\n\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish.\n\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\n\nAlberto Grandi Grandi's latest book has stirred new controversies with its provocative title (Credit: Alberto Grandi)\n\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\n\nIs Italian cuisine really American?\n\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\n\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth – popularised by social media – that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\n\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\n\nGetty Images According to Grandi, pizza was transformed in America into the dish we know and love today (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off.\n\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\n\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier – a smaller wheel with a black rind – is now only made in Wisconsin.\n\nInvented traditions\n\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator.\n\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\n\nGetty Images Carbonara is another controversial dish, with the \"authentic recipe\" including pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese – and no cream (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future – that's why they \"invent the past\".\n\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called ragù alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\n\nAn Italian reaction to food 'blasphemy'\n\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\n\nAurora Cavallo Italian cuisine is one of the most recognised and loved in the world (Credit: Aurora Cavallo)\n\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation – with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\n\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\n\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\n\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\n\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Instead, they may be a template for the UK's geothermal industry.\n\nAs the police moved in, Mike Potter gritted his teeth. It seemed to him that he and his fellow protesters were being \"kettled\" – surrounded by police and constrained from moving. \"No fracking here!\", the demonstrators chanted, gripping their colourful placards.\n\nIn 2016, the prospect of it came to the tiny village of Kirby Misperton in the north of England, close to Potter's home. That year, a local council granted the energy firm Third Energy planning permission to begin fracking at the site.\n\n\"I thought, until all these people, governments and companies, can actually prove to me that they can and will do this safely,\" recalls Potter, \"I'm going to be anti-fracking.\"\n\nIt was a risk. He had a government job with security clearance – if police arrested him, it could have been highly damaging to his career. In the end, widespread opposition to fracking led to the UK government banning the practice in England in 2019.\n\nPotter and his fellow protestors were relieved. But questions remained – namely, what was going to happen to the would-be fracking site, a roughly rectangular patch of ground packed with industrial equipment and surrounded by North Yorkshire fields?\n\nFor years, deep boreholes had yielded gas here, but that gas is now depleted. (And this explains Third Energy’s previous attempts to repurpose the wells for fracking, to squeeze some more gas out of the site.) Now, the firm, acquired in 2024 by renewables company CeraPhi Energy, says it has a new and very different idea: geothermal energy.\n\nGetty Images The site of the KM8 borehole was originally to be used for fracking, but has now been tapped for geothermal (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAround the world, many different forms of geothermal energy are in use. Iceland, for instance, gains a significant portion of its heating needs from geothermal. Its engineers have long worked on a project to tap into the searing heat of an underground volcano to generate electricity.\n\nBut geothermal potential also lies in less geologically active places. And old oil wells, sometimes multiple kilometres deep, can reach underground regions that are naturally warm. The deeper you go, the hotter the rocks tend to be.\n\nIn the approach proposed by Third Energy, known as closed-loop geothermal, a sealed, water-filled loop is sunk deep inside former oil or gas wells to absorb the naturally occurring heat at their bases. The warmed water in the loop then returns to the surface. In this way, the heat can be passed to nearby buildings.\n\nUnlike fracking, there is no forcing of fluid into the adjacent rock. \"You're not touching the geology at all,\" says Russell Hoare, managing director at Third Energy. \"You're just putting a small tube on the inside of the well.\"\n\nThe deepest well at Kirby Misperton, dubbed KM8, descends for 3km (1.9 miles). In tests, the temperature at the well's base was even hotter than Third Energy expected – around 115C (240F), rather than the anticipated 90C (190F) or so. Early experiments by Third Energy suggested that the system could maintain a steady temperature of around 42C (108F) at the surface. Heat pumps would boost this heat supply further, if necessary, before passing it on to local homes.\n\n\"That well, if it was configured properly, could probably provide enough heat for 100 homes,\" says Hoare.\n\nHoare also says that Third Energy has a total of 12 wells it could use for geothermal energy in Yorkshire, three of them at Kirby Misperton. \"What this gives me is potentially another 25-plus years' life out of those wells,\" he adds, explaining that the firm is keen to drill additional wells locally to expand their future network of geothermal boreholes, if possible.\n\nGetty Images There are several old fossil fuel wells near the rural North Yorkshire village of Kirby Misperton in the UK (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe process isn't cheap. Even for a well half the depth of KM8, it could cost up to £1m ($1.3m) to drill and fit it with the water loop equipment. But there's a big potential pay-off, says Hoare: the wells might provide heat for many years, practically without interruption, so long as the resource is maintained by occasionally topping up the underground heat. This could be achieved by periodically sending hot water down the loop within the well to raise the temperature of the geology below.\n\nFormer protestors like Potter scrutinised Third Energy's proposals. Many were initially sceptical of the plans. But after witnessing a demonstration of how the system might work, Potter says, \"I was absolutely blown away.\" He now volunteers on behalf of Third Energy and has canvassed local organisations and businesses, from schools to a nearby swimming pool, to find out how much heat energy they need and whether they might be able to make use of a future geothermal supply.\n\nIt helps them keep fossil fuels in the ground and it could be the template for a whole new industry – Hazel Winter\n\nFellow former protestor and local resident Hazel Winter, a teaching assistant, is also gung-ho for the new idea. \"It's all for the good, it's a complete turnaround,\" adds Winter. \"It helps them keep fossil fuels in the ground and it could be the template for a whole new industry.\"\n\nPotter recalls marvelling at the system – heat drawn out of the ground and yet no disruption to the rock or soil below. \"I was looking at this thinking, 'This is just too good to be true – what's the catch?'\" he says.\n\nHowever, there may be one, according to Gioia Falcone, an expert in geothermal energy at the UK's University of Glasgow. In particular, she is highly sceptical of Third Energy's claim that KM8 alone could potentially provide enough heat for 100 British homes. \"I doubt very much that even if all 12 boreholes were fitted with this concept that they could be heating 100 homes,\" she says.\n\nIn a conference paper delivered in February 2025, Falcone and colleagues presented an analysis of the KM8 well's potential. They found that KM8 might not stay as hot as hoped. As heat is drawn out of the well, the temperature in the surrounding geology will drop over time, they say. The team calculates that the output temperature may ultimately be limited to 21.8C (71.2F), which would result in only enough heat energy to supply a maximum of 19 homes, if each home uses around 11,200 KWh annually.\n\nHoare says the paper is \"flawed\" because Falcone and her colleagues did not have full access to all the data the company has collected about the functioning of the well system – such as the steady state temperature the well has achieved, which is higher than the one calculated by the researchers. He also says that the system would perform best with multiple heat pumps at each residential user's property, which the paper does not appear to consider. As a result, he says, the three wells could supply much more energy than the paper's estimate – 6,900,000 kWh over 12 months, or enough for a few hundred homes each requiring 10,000 kWh, allowing for some losses in the distribution of that heat.\n\nFleur Loveridge at the University of Leeds in the UK, who specialises in underground energy systems, says there are examples of closed-loop borehole heat exchangers that have produced significant amounts of heat. There is one in Germany, for instance, which researchers say has a capacity of 600 kilowatts. This is from a single, roughly 3km-deep borehole, not unlike KM8. That might provide many thousands, or potentially more than a million, kWh of heat energy over a whole year, depending on how the system was managed – which could be enough to heat 100 homes, just as Hoare suggested.\n\n\"It certainly sounds ambitious but it doesn't sound impossible,\" says Loveridge, who praises Third Energy's proposals for Kirby Misperton. \"And it's exactly the sort of thing we should be doing.\"\n\nRoughly a quarter of carbon emissions in the UK comes from the heating of buildings, Loveridge says, and it is particularly difficult to move away from heat sources such as natural gas. The vast majority of domestic heating systems in the UK currently use gas or oil and switching to alternatives can sometimes be costly or impractical for homeowners. Renewables such as geothermal ought to play a \"substantive\" role in the future, she says.\n\nGetty Images The KM8 borehole has seen several uses and proposed uses – its latest is a model for using these deep wells for heating water (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThere are signs that geothermal energy is beginning to gain ground. The British Geological Survey began work on a project in 2024 that will see 28 relatively shallow boreholes, 225m (740ft) deep, drilled near their headquarters in Nottinghamshire – an effort to decarbonise the heating of the organisation's offices.\n\nElsewhere, the US Geothermal Technologies Office has run an initiative to explore converting old oil wells to geothermal energy sites in states including Utah, Texas and Nevada. The European Union has also funded research in a similar vein.\n\nWhile Third Energy is focused on deep boreholes, shallow boreholes, less than 500m (1,640ft) in depth, can be useful, too, says Falcone. This is because they can store thermal energy in the summer so that it will be available in the winter when heat is needed. This kind of system could supply a university campus or an urban district, she says.\n\nAs for Kirby Misperton, the heavy work required to make Third Energy's proposals a reality has not yet begun. Hoare says the firm received a grant for £40,000 ($50,400) in February, which will help it move further towards launching a large-scale project beyond a mere demonstration.\n\nIn the meantime, Potter fizzes with enthusiasm at the potential. \"This is our home-produced heat energy,\" he says, mindful of the high price British homeowners have paid for imported gas and other heating fuels in recent years.\n\nIf a geothermal project at Kirby Misperton never gets off the ground, or never lives up to the promises made by Third Energy, Potter says he will be \"most disappointed\". But if it does work and if the technology could be replicated across the rest of the UK, he adds, \"It could be absolutely massive.\"\n\n*Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Kirby Misperton wells had yielded oil. This has been corrected to clarify that they were gas only wells.\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

Can we stop it weakening by 2050?\n\nFlowing clockwise around Antarctica, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the strongest ocean current on the planet. It's five times stronger than the Gulf Stream and more than 100 times stronger than the Amazon River.\n\nIt forms part of the global ocean \"conveyor belt\" connecting the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. The system regulates Earth's climate and pumps water, heat and nutrients around the globe.\n\nBut fresh, cool water from melting Antarctic ice is diluting the salty water of the ocean, potentially disrupting the vital ocean current.\n\nOur new research suggests the Antarctic Circumpolar Current will be 20% slower by 2050 as the world warms, with far-reaching consequences for life on Earth.\n\nT. Sohail (2025 The Antarctic Circumpolar Current keeps Antarctica isolated from the rest of the global ocean (Credit: T. Sohail (2025), Environmental Research Letters)\n\nThe Antarctic Circumpolar Current is like a moat around the icy continent.\n\nThe current helps to keep warm water at bay, protecting vulnerable ice sheets. It also acts as a barrier to invasive species such as southern bull kelp and any animals hitching a ride on these rafts, spreading them out as they drift towards the continent. It also plays a big part in regulating the Earth's climate.\n\nUnlike better known ocean currents – such as the Gulf Stream along the United States' east coast, the Kuroshio Current near Japan, and the Agulhas Current off the coast of South Africa – the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is not as well understood. This is partly due to its remote location, which makes obtaining direct measurements especially difficult.\n\nThe influence of climate change\n\nOcean currents respond to changes in temperature, salt levels, wind patterns and sea ice extent. So the global ocean conveyor belt is vulnerable to climate change on multiple fronts.\n\nPrevious research suggested one vital part of this conveyor belt could be headed for a catastrophic collapse.\n\nTheoretically, warming water around Antarctica should speed up the current. This is because density changes and winds around Antarctica dictate the strength of the current. Warm water is less dense (or heavy) and this should be enough to speed up the current. But observations to date indicate the strength of the current has remained relatively stable over recent decades.\n\nThis stability persists despite melting of surrounding ice, a phenomenon that had not been fully explored in scientific discussions in the past.\n\nGetty Images The complex ecosystems of Antarctica are at risk from invasive species (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAdvances in ocean modelling allow a more thorough investigation of the potential future changes.\n\nWe used Australia's fastest supercomputer and climate simulator in Canberra to study the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The underlying model, Access-OM2-01, has been developed by Australian researchers from various universities as part of the Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia.\n\nThe model captures features others often miss, such as eddies. So it's a far more accurate way to assess how the current's strength and behaviour will change as the world warms. It picks up the intricate interactions between ice melting and ocean circulation.\n\nIn this future projection, cold, fresh melt water from Antarctica migrates north, filling the deep ocean as it goes. This causes major changes to the density structure of the ocean. It counteracts the influence of ocean warming, leading to an overall slowdown in the current of as much as 20% by 2050.\n\nFar-reaching consequences\n\nThe consequences of a weaker Antarctic Circumpolar Current are profound and far-reaching.\n\nAs the main current that circulates nutrient-rich waters around Antarctica, it plays a crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem.\n\nWeakening of the current could reduce biodiversity and decrease the productivity of fisheries that many coastal communities rely on. It could also aid the entry of invasive species such as southern bull kelp to Antarctica, disrupting local ecosystems and food webs.\n\nA weaker current may also allow more warm water to penetrate southwards, exacerbating the melting of Antarctic ice shelves and contributing to global sea-level rise. Faster ice-melting could then lead to further weakening of the current, commencing a vicious spiral of current slowdown.\n\nThis disruption could extend to global climate patterns, reducing the ocean's ability to regulate climate change by absorbing excess heat and carbon in the atmosphere.\n\nThe need to reduce emissions\n\nWhile our findings present a bleak prognosis for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the future is not predetermined. Concerted efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could still limit melting around Antarctica.\n\nEstablishing long-term studies in the Southern Ocean will be crucial for monitoring these changes accurately.\n\nWith proactive and coordinated international actions, we have a chance to address and potentially avert the effects of climate change on our oceans.\n\nThis article is adapted from a piece that originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

There were a few screams and high-rise buildings reportedly wobbled.\n\nThe magnitude 3.9 earthquake that hit North Hollywood on 2 March 2025 was the latest in a number of jolts to have hit the area. The earthquake was measured to have occurred at a depth of around 9 miles (15km), but was felt in parts of the city several miles away. Another much smaller magnitude 1.3 earthquake was detected almost in the same location a few hours later. No damage to buildings was reported.\n\nThe most recent occured a little over an hour after sunset on 6 August 2024, when a sparsely populated belt of farmland near Bakersfield, Southern California, was shaken from a restful evening. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake, followed by hundreds of smaller aftershocks, shuddered through the area as a fault near the southern end of the Central Valley ruptured – the largest earthquake to hit Southern California in three years. The epicenter was about 17 miles (27km) south of Bakersfield and people reported shaking nearly 90 miles (145km) away in portions of Los Angeles and as far away as San Diego. Then, a few days later, another jolt rattled the Los Angeles area due to a rupture on a small section of the dangerous Puente Hills fault system. The resulting magnitude 4.4 earthquake had its epicentre just four miles northeast of the city's downtown area.\n\nAlthough there was minimal damage caused by both quakes in August 2024 and the less severe shake in Hollywood in March 2025, they highlighted just how the geology under California's largest city can alter the effects of fault movements in the area. The relatively shallow depth of the 6 August earthquake appeared to create more intense or prolonged shaking in some parts of the city, while others felt almost nothing at all.\n\nThere are various reasons for why this might be – including what people were doing at the time of the earthquake – but the enormous five-mile-deep (8km), sediment-filled basin that LA is built upon plays a surprising role in the effects felt above ground.\n\nThe travelling earthquake\n\nWhile the ground feels steadfast at the surface, deeply buried bedrock can resemble a shattered window pane. These cracks, or faults, are where earthquakes occur. Faults are put under tremendous stress by the slow and steady movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.\n\nIn California, the North American plate and the Pacific Plate are grinding past each other along the infamous San Andreas fault, averaging about 30-50 millimeters (1-2 inches) every year. The movement is anything but fluid. Cracked rocks are rough and wedge against each other, sometimes staying stuck for thousands of years. Over time, stress created by the slow marching tectonic plates builds up and when the fault reaches its stress limit, it \"slips\" and ruptures, causing an earthquake.\n\nImagine the Los Angeles basin as a giant bowl of jelly – the mountains and underlying rock make up the bowl, while the sediment is represented by the gelatinous mixture\n\nA rupture begins at one location and travels in one direction along the fault, stretching up to hundreds of kilometers. The longest rupture ever recorded was a 994 mile (1,600km) portion of a fault that caused the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and resulting tsunami on Boxing Day 2004. \"The farther it goes, the longer [the earthquake] lasts, and the more energy that's released. So the longer the fault, the bigger the earthquake,\" explains seismologist Lucy Jones, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology and former seismologist with the US Geological Survey.\n\nDuring an earthquake, the stored energy saved within the sticky fault is released suddenly. Seismic waves radiate out from the rupture like the ripples created by throwing a rock into a pond, spreading in all directions through the surrounding rock and earth.\n\nThe magnitude of an earthquake tells scientists about the length of the ruptured fault as well as the duration of shaking, says Jones. But the intensity of an earthquake – the ground motions we feel at a location – is shaped by how close we are to the epicenter, which direction the fault ruptured, and the geological layers under our feet.\n\nGeology-induced complications\n\nLos Angeles is located south of a giant a bend in the San Andreas fault where the plate boundary clearly changes direction. \"If you see it from the air, it's amazing,\" says Jones. \"It's so bizarre – you can look down and see the fault valley and then it just turns.\"\n\nAround the turn, the region is chock full of faults. Over millions of years, the faults churned and pushed slabs of bedrock into multiple mountain ranges and deep basins. Gravity, water and wind act like sandpaper, wearing down the mountains, and carrying debris into the basins. Over time, the basins have been filled with sediment.\n\nThe bowl-shaped basin of rock under Los Angeles is up to five miles (8km) deep, filled with a mixture of gravel, sand and clay. The contrast between the hard rock and softer sediment are big factors that cause some seismic weirdness for cities like Los Angeles.\n\nDuring an earthquake, seismic waves are modulated by geology, says John Vidale, professor of seismology at University of Southern California. \"The primary factor is just how hard is the ground and how deep is the structure that has soft [material] near the surface,\" he says. Seismic waves will move faster in denser material like rock, versus softer and less dense sediment.\n\nAs seismic waves travel through the basin, their behaviour changes when they encounter the loose sediment. \"[The wave] is now having to travel at a much slower speed, but it still has to carry the same amount of energy per unit time,\" said Jones. As the wave slogs through the sediment, the amplitude, or wave height, gets bigger.\n\nPut another way, imagine the Los Angeles basin as a giant bowl of jelly – the dense rocky mountains and underlying rock make up the bowl, while the sediment fill is represented by the gelatinous mixture. \"If you shake the bottom [of the bowl] a little bit, the top flops back and forth quite a bit,\" says Vidale. And atop this quivering mass of jelly is the megacity of Los Angeles.\n\nGetty Images The San Andreas fault between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates is clearly visible from the air in places (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThis means the amplitude of the waves within a basin can be significantly bigger than those moving through rock. In one study, researchers using earthquake measurements in the Los Angeles region from the 1992 Landers earthquake found that seismic waves inside the Los Angeles basin were three to four times larger than sites outside the basin.\n\nIn addition to amplification, seismic waves can also reverberate within a sediment-filled basin. Think back to that shaking bowl of jelly and how the flopping top bounces off the sides of the bowl. Scientists from the Statewide California Earthquake Center simulated earthquakes in the Los Angeles region and found that the basin can trap seismic wave energy in a similar way. This reverberation can mean shaking can often go on for longer than the duration of the fault rupture itself, increasing the hazard for the city built on top.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough for Los Angeles, the close proximity of the San Bernadino and San Gabriel Basins to the Los Angeles Basins can create a funneling effect, directing seismic waves towards Los Angeles.\n\nEven within a basin, there can be differences in how the sediment interacts with seismic waves. \"There's variability in the shaking… there's variations in the geology,\" says Vidale. Sediment in the upper 330ft (100m) of the basin tends to be looser and less dense than the deeper, compacted sediment below. Sediment changes can also happen quickly at the surface. \"Old stream channels, for example, can be filled with a kind of wet, soft material,\" Vidale says. \"So, if you happen to be in an old stream channel, you'll get hit a lot harder than somebody even a quarter mile away that's on firmer ground.\"\n\nEven those in the same house can have different experiences, especially if the earthquake is on the smaller side. \"I'm in Pasadena, on the sediment in the San Gabriel Valley,\" say Jones. Despite both being in the house, she and her husband had different experiences of the earthquake on 6 August 2024. \"I felt it, my husband didn't,\" she says.\n\nBasins, basins everywhere\n\nWhile the city of Los Angeles ticks a lot of seismic hazard boxes, it is not the only urban center that needs to worry. Throughout human history, people have tended to build cities on flat ground near water bodies.\n\nIt just so happens that these sites tend to form above geologic basins and sometimes near faults.\n\nGetty Images Scientists are trying to better understand how large earthquakes will propagate through the LA basin to assess where the risk of damage is greatest (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhile the US has a few famous cities built on basins – Seattle, Portland, and Salt Lake City – there are many others around the world that experience amplified seismic waves due to where they are situated. After the European settlers drained Lake Texcoco in the 1500s, Mexico City was built on the flat, old lake bottom. In 1985 and 2017, the city experienced significant damage from earthquakes that shook the basin sediments.\n\nThe desert megacity of Tehran in Iran also sits atop a geologic basin filled with river sediments, and there is growing concern about the risk of a major earthquake in the area.\n\nUnderstanding the earthquake risk is the first step in bolstering protection for a city against significant shaking. Enacting robust building codes can be another way to protect people and infrastructure, but it often takes a major event for stricter regulations to be implemented. After the devastating earthquake in 1985, for example, Mexico City enacted stringent building codes, and retrofitted older buildings.\n\n\"The very first earthquake codes [in California] went in after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake,\" adds Jones. At that time, schools were built out of firesafe, unreinforced brick. \"Seventy schools were completely destroyed – luckily, it was at six o'clock at night,\" says Jones. The horror of collapsing schools spurred regulation, but initial codes were meagre. \"They basically just said, 'don't build unreinforced masonry in California'. That was sort of the first basic code.\"\n\nToday, assessing earthquake risks is a lot more nuanced.\n\nIn the US, a team of seismologists, geoscientists and geophysicists have created a seismic hazard map, showing the chances of a damaging earthquake shaking in the next 100 years. In their latest version of the report, the team found that that nearly 75% of the US could experience damaging shaking. To help policymakers and engineers, the team included information on the implications for building and structural designs.\n\nWhile building codes can protect lives, scientists like Jones want building codes to go further. Designing buildings so they can be more easily repaired rather than needing to be demolished would cost an extra 1% in the construction phase, Jones estimates. \"We're calling it 'functional recovery',\" she says.\n\n\"We are trying to say that 'just not killing you' is an insufficient standard. The reality is, if your building's badly damaged and now has to be torn down after the earthquake, you've hurt your tenants, you've hurt your neighbors, you've hurt the local economy.\"\n\nFortunately, the buildings of Los Angeles rode out the latest quakes to rattle Southern California pretty well. But at some point, the city won't be so lucky.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\n\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of Jørn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\n\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\n\nWATCH: 'It was called 'The Sydney Harbour Monster'.\n\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023.\n\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it – the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\n\nIt was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent – Trevor Philpott\n\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\n\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\n\nGetty Images The opera house was originally scheduled to open in January 1963 – but in fact the building wasn't completed until 1973 (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018.\n\nAn optimistic start\n\nThe judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\n\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\n\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A£3.5m or A$7m – at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\n\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\n\nIf you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted – Sir Jack Zunz\n\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 – the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\n\nBut this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\n\nGetty Images Danish architect Jørn Utzon in front of his under-construction creation – he resigned from the project in 1966, and never saw it completed (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAn unbuildable building\n\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\n\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\n\nIn History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\n\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A£12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\n\nThe project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\n\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors – the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\n\nUtzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\n\nOvercoming the odds\n\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\n\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (£51m).\n\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\n\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (£33m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him.\n\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\n\nAs a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Björk and Massive Attack. In 1980, Arnold Schwarzenegger won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\n\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\n\n--\n\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

        "content": "'Cheesy and clichéd': Why the Oscars ceremony needs 'a major shake-up'\n\n1 day ago Share Save Nicholas Barber Share Save\n\nGetty Images (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThis year's show featured a bizarre James Bond tribute – while failing to duly honour visionary director David Lynch. That choice spoke to the awards' profound identity crisis.\n\nEarly on in Sunday's three-and-three-quarter hour Academy Awards ceremony, there was a tribute to the James Bond franchise, consisting of a Broadway dance routine from Margaret Qualley and three classic theme songs belted out by Lisa, Doja Cat and Raye. It was a strange segment, not just because no Bond films have been released in the past three years, but because the series' long-time custodians, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, have just handed over control of their family business to Amazon. Considering that so many of the evening's speeches praised cinema and the cinema-going experience, it was embarrassing that the Academy's 007 tribute coincided with the selling of one of cinema's most spectacular, big-screen-worthy assets to a streaming service.\n\nWouldn't a tribute to the late David Lynch have been more apposite? Lynch, who died in January, is regarded as one of modern American film's most singular visionaries – and he was a four-time Oscar nominee and an honorary Oscar winner to boot. Yet he merited just a few seconds in the In Memoriam montage. Later in the ceremony, though, there was time for a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, who is undoubtedly a legendary figure, but more in the music world than film. This sequence consisted of Queen Latifah's performance of Ease on Down the Road, a song from The Wiz (1978) which was produced but not written by Jones. With all due respect, do any film fans believe that The Wiz merits more attention than such Lynch masterpieces as The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive?\n\nEssentially it was yet another evening in which a bored man in a bow tie made snide, roast-style jibes about films that deserve better\n\nPresumably the producers of the Oscars do – and that could be why the institution has such a profound identity crisis. Glance at the list of winners, and you'll see that this was probably the most radical celebration of innovative, low-budget cinema in Oscar history. And yet the cheesy and clichéd ceremony is lagging decades behind the tastes of its voters.\n\nThe biggest winners of the night were Anora and The Brutalist, two independent films made by auteurs with big ideas and tiny budgets. (Last year we had Barbenheimer. This year we had… Brutanora? The Anoralist? Maybe not.) Brady Corbet's defiantly serious period drama, The Brutalist, won the Oscars for score, cinematography and leading actor (Adrien Brody's rambling speech really should have had an interval, like the film itself). But the voters' favourite was Anora. Sean Baker's heart-tugging screwball tragicomedy won the Oscar for best picture as well as for director, original screenplay and editor – quite a haul for Baker, a boundary-pushing low-budget film-maker who did all three jobs himself.\n\nGetty Images This year's acting winners Adrien Brody, Mikey Madison, Zoe Saldaña and Kieran Culkin were spread across four different films (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe star of Anora, Mikey Madison, also won the best actress prize, making this an historic occasion in which two different Oscar acceptance speeches paid tribute to the sex worker community. The 25-year-old definitely deserved the Academy Award for her explosively dynamic yet sensitive performance, but she is almost a newcomer, so it was hard not to feel sorry for her closest rival, Demi Moore. In The Substance, Moore plays a middle-aged Hollywood actress who is usurped by her fresh-faced young doppelganger, so when Madison took to the stage to her accept her Oscar, and Moore was left in her seat, there was a cruel and eerie sense that the plot of The Substance was unfolding in real life.\n\nStill, The Substance won for make-up and hairstyling – not bad going for a delirious body-horror film from a French director. Jacques Audiard's trans gangster musical, Emilia Perez, won best supporting actress (Zoe Saldaña) and best song. And Walter Salles's political yet personal Brazilian drama, I'm Still Here, won best international film. There were technical awards for Dune: Part Two and Wicked, and an adapted screenplay prize for Conclave, but in most of the high-profile categories, this was an Oscars for the underdogs: an evening when leftfield artists like Baker won awards, and then spoke about the value of independent film-making and going to see films in cinemas.\n\nKieran Culkin won best supporting actor for A Real Pain, as expected, and he swore in his acceptance speech, as expected. The best animated feature film was Flow, a cartoon made in Latvia using free, open-source software. And the best documentary feature was No Other Land, a documentary set on the occupied West Bank and made by an Israeli/Palestinian collective, which doesn't even have a US distributor. A few years ago, a film like Flow could never have toppled a Disney-Pixar cartoon as popular as Inside Out 2, but the Academy's drive to bring in a younger, more diverse set of voters is obviously having an effect.\n\nIf only the show had been affected, too. Instead, the proceedings could easily have been mistaken for a 1970s television variety show. The host was Conan O'Brien, following two years when Jimmy Kimmel was master of ceremonies, so that's three years in a row when the event took its self-satisfied tone from a late-night talk-show host delivering late-night talk-show wisecracks. O'Brien wasn't unfunny, exactly, and he made the odd sharply political comment, but essentially it was yet another evening in which a bored man in a bow tie made snide, roast-style jibes about films that deserve better. The Oscars are clearly in their \"safe pair of hands\" era when, in the wake of the notorious La La Land/ Moonlight envelope mix-up, and Will Smith's slapping of Chris Rock, the producers are intent on making everything as middle-of-the-road and predictable as possible. The show was slick and glitzy enough, with nothing actively obnoxious about it except for the insulting practice of cutting off the winners' speeches, while making time for O'Brien's skits. But the format is getting so tired that it's no longer fit for purpose.\n\nYou don't have to take my word for it. \"If you're still enjoying the show, you have something called Stockholm Syndrome,\" said O'Brien after about three hours. And if a show's host is joking about how much of an endurance test it is, then a major shake-up is required. What the ceremony needs now is even a fraction of the invention, daring and energy which are evident in the films it's honouring. Oscar winners have changed. Now it's time for Oscar night to change, too.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

It is also designed to help you select and manage suitable inbound feeds and other online sources of third-party content for publication on BBC Online.\n\nFor advice on distribution, including syndication, see Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Distribution.\n\nSee Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Distribution 16.3.14 – 16.3.16\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe BBC’s global reputation is based on its editorial integrity and independence. Our audiences need to be confident that our decisions are influenced neither by political or commercial pressures, nor by any personal interests. We must not undermine these values by any actions which could bring the BBC into disrepute.\n\nThe Editorial Guidelines state that:\n\nour impartiality, editorial integrity and independence must not be compromised by outside interests and arrangements we must maintain independent editorial control over our content\n\nwe must not give undue prominence to products, services or trade marks, though we can refer to them and credit them where it is editorially justified\n\nThe BBC will not accept product placement on its UK Public Services, and Public Services must not endorse or promote any other organisation, or its products, services, trade marks, activities or opinions. While our Commercial Services must not promote products, services and trade marks in their content, they can make reference to another organisation, its products, services, trade marks or activities as part of a commercial arrangement. If they do, they must follow the guidelines on product placement, and on advertising and sponsorship which explain that it is not appropriate to make deals with some types of organisation.\n\non air and online credits must be clearly editorially justified\n\n(See also Editorial Guidelines Section 14: Independence from External Interests: Introduction 14.1 and Logos and Credits Online 14.3.21)\n\nLinks to external sites\n\nWhenever producers are creating content on a BBC site, they should actively consider which external websites it may be editorially justifiable to link to.\n\nEditorial justification for linking to external sites\n\nProducers may wish to offer links to external sites for a number of reasons, including:\n\nfor further relevant information\n\nfor further background information or other key source material\n\nfor useful practical information\n\nfor further informed comment\n\nA link must never be included on the public service site or within the editorial content of a commercial site in return for cash, services or any other consideration in kind.\n\nAll links on the BBC Public Service site or on the editorial pages of a BBC Commercial site must be editorially justifiable and suitable for the intended audience – particularly children.\n\nLinks are not acceptable as a form of credit.\n\nEditorial checks\n\nProducers must check the contents of the site which is signposted before adding a link to a BBC page, although responsibility for including the link lies with the relevant editor.\n\nWhere this is practical, we should consider ways to make it easy for users who find broken, stale or inappropriate external BBC links to report these to us so that we can check, update, replace or remove them.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nWhere we publish a list of links we should add the standard disclaimer to the effect that \"the BBC is not responsible for the contents of any other sites listed\". If the links are to controversial or challenging material, it may be appropriate to add a specific disclaimer and more information, closer to the links, even when there are only one or two links on a page. For “in story” links to such material, for example to very sensitive content such as a gruelling account of torture, it may be helpful to alert the user to this, in context, as part of telling the story.\n\nLinks to sites which do not share BBC editorial values\n\nContext is important in deciding whether a link is appropriate and it is often useful to explain why we are offering the link. In some cases we may offer a link to a site which does not share our editorial values, but which offers a useful insight. For example we might link from a current affairs page to the site of a government-run national news agency so that the user can see the precise words used in a government statement.\n\nControversial content\n\nWe must be duly impartial. BBC sites which cover a controversial or public policy matter may offer links to external sites which, taken together, represent a reasonable range of views about the subject. We should ensure that when we link to third party sites that we take into account any concerns about potential breaches of the law, for example, defamation or incitement to racial hatred.\n\nWhere content is likely to cause serious offence to some users and yet there is a strong editorial justification for covering the story, it may be editorially justifiable for the BBC to link to the relevant site rather than to host the content ourselves.\n\nCharities\n\nLinks to charity sites have to be based on sensible editorial criteria. If one charity is in the news, it may be appropriate to establish a link to the site of that charity. But we must take care not to promote one charity above another. If we are giving advice or general information about the subject and wish to refer to a charity and there is a range of charities working in the field, we should normally link to the other significant charities working in the field as well. This guidance applies to online links offered by BBC Action Lines.\n\n(See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: BBC Support Services 14.3.26)\n\nWe should also consider where on the charity website we link to – for example it may be appropriate to link to useful sources of information, but not to campaigning or fundraising pages.\n\nProgramme Support\n\nFor programme support pages, an external link should be justified by the relevance and value of the material to the programme's viewers and listeners. If we give a link to an outside advice agency from a support page, we should give links to a reasonable range of other relevant agencies as well.\n\nWhere a consumer programme reviews a product or service, we should only offer links to the sites of the manufacturers, suppliers or retailers of any goods or services mentioned where strictly editorially justifiable.\n\nUndue prominence\n\nThere must be no undue prominence of products, services or trade marks in our content.\n\n(See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: Product Prominence 14.3.1)\n\nPublic Services must not endorse or promote any other organisation, or its products, services or trademarks, so great care must be taken when linking to any site in order not to give the impression that the BBC is doing so.\n\nBBC Public Service sites should not normally link direct to pages whose main purpose is transactional e.g. selling merchandise, downloads or tickets.\n\nSee exceptions below for links to buy BBC-related programme content and links to buy tickets for BBC Events. There are some occasions where we may also wish to link directly to a donations page for a BBC charitable appeal.\n\n(See Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Charities 16.3.43)\n\nIf in any doubt, refer to Editorial Policy.\n\nLinks from BBC Public Services to the BBC’s Commercial sites\n\nGeneral points:\n\nLinks to buy tickets\n\nBBC programmes and sites regularly cover music concerts and tours. Linking policy to sites where users can buy tickets will depend on the nature of the event.\n\nIf it is a BBC mounted or run event (on the Public Services to contribute to the BBC’s Mission and Public Purposes), then a direct link to the source of the tickets is likely to be editorially justifiable.\n\n(See Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing Ticket Sales 16.3.34)\n\nIf it is not a BBC mounted or run event (and where for example a BBC network is simply broadcasting a concert organised by someone else) then a direct link to the relevant band’s site is likely to be editorially justifiable, with one more click from there to the ticket agency’s site.\n\nPart 2: Inbound feeds and embeds\n\nPulling third-party content on to BBC Online pages is more editorially sensitive than linking externally. Following an external link takes you away from the BBC site and users have a chance to adjust their expectations in the light of that journey. But as third party content sits with BBC content on BBC branded pages, users are more likely to expect it to have been through a rigorous editorial examination and to comply with BBC editorial standards before being published on our site.\n\nEditorial responsibility\n\nThe person who is editorially responsible for the page on which the feed or embed appears will be responsible for the content from that feed or embed. This principle will apply whether it is a bespoke feed to a single page or a general feed to many pages.\n\nWe would not normally embed a live feed of video or text unless we had a contractual relationship with the supplier that provides assurances about the content or we could be otherwise confident that the content is appropriate to be shared on our own platforms.\n\nTransparency\n\nWhere we take in content from an external supplier, we should be transparent about it with our users. Attribution should be as close as possible to the content in question.\n\nWe should provide a clear and easy route for our users to report a mistake or find offensive or inappropriate content on a feed.\n\nEmbeds\n\nEmbedded video, for example of a social networking site video player such as YouTube or Vimeo on a BBC page, may be a useful way to display editorially relevant non-BBC content.\n\nEven though the content is not under our control it appears to the audience that it is part of our online content. We should therefore make it clear that the embedded video is from a third party site and give the audience a direct route to report to the relevant editorial team any inappropriate content, such as advertising, that might appear on that video.",

        "content": "Ireland's time-warped island of Owey is the perfect place to disconnect\n\n1 day ago Share Save Julie Diamond Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nLocated off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life – and adventurous travellers are welcome.\n\nFriday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades.\n\nLocated off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (or Uaigh in Irish, meaning \"cave\") is approximately 15 minutes by boat from Cruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation – and modern-day pressures – further away.\n\nLast inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.\n\nI was spending a long weekend on Owey with the Wild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group \"somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible\".\n\n- Julie Diamond Abandoned in the 1970s, Owey Island is now home to around 20-30 seasonal residents (Credit: Julie Diamond)\n\nShe explained: \"It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming.\" she added.\n\nPaul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height of the Troubles. \"My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,\" explained Cowan. \"The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].\"\n\nGreen Getaways Green Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\n\nHaving since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.\n\nDespite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.\n\nSeeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.\n\n- Iain Miller World-class climbers visit the island to brave the vertiginous sea stacks that rise out of the Atlantic Ocean (Credit: Iain Miller)\n\nOwey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.\n\nSix of our 14-strong group were staying in Owey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.\n\nPlan your trip: When to go: From March to September. It's difficult to get on and off the island when the weather is harsher during autumn and winter. Where to stay: Owey Island Cottage Hostel offers self-catering accommodation for up to six people during the warmer months (booking is essential). There is a gas stove but no fridge. You can also free camp on the green space beside the pier, where there is a compost toilet for public use. What to do: Hike the island hills, climb the sea cliffs with Unique Ascent, wild swim in the clifftop lake, take a guided kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing. Where to eat: There is nowhere on the island to buy food and drink so bring all provisions with you. Cruit Island Golf Club serves food and drink in a scenic setting.\n\nThe hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.\n\nOne local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. \"Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,\" he said.\n\nAlongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. \"But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,\" he added.\n\n- Julie Diamond There's no electricity on the island and the hostel has a compost toilet in an outhouse (Credit: Julie Diamond)\n\nGallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare – and noisy – bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.\n\nThe hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.\n\nStay connected: Despite having no power lines, internet connection on Owey is excellent. However, there is no electricity to plug in a charger so bring a portable charger for your phone and other tech.\n\nThe car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the \"village centre\" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.\n\nFragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.\n\nBy contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren – too rough to live on – with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.\n\n- Julie Diamond A freshwater lake hidden among the cliffs at the back of the island (Credit: Julie Diamond)\n\nA highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.\n\nTo enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.\n\nPlunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed – engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.\n\nOur last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals – who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend – joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.\n\nSitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition of the Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, \"We're winning aren't we?\". Even though I'd only met her a couple of days before, I knew exactly what she meant: the fresh air, the island's stories relayed through song, the stars so visible in the night sky… the peacefulness of Owey.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Why Vermont farmers are using urine on their crops\n\n3 days ago Share Save Becca Warner Share Save\n\nRich Earth Institute In Vermont, pasteurised urine is sprayed on local farmland to fertilise crops (Credit: Rich Earth Institute)\n\nUrine was used as fertiliser in ancient Rome and China. Now farmers in Vermont are bringing this practice back to boost harvests and grow crops in a more sustainable way.\n\nWhen Betsy Williams goes to the loo, she likes to know her pee won't go to waste. For the last 12 years, she and her neighbours in rural Vermont, US, have diligently collected their urine and donated it to farmers for use as fertiliser for their crops.\n\n\"We're consuming all of these things that have nutrients in them, and then a lot of the nutrients that are passing through us can then get recycled back into helping create food for us and for animals. So to me, it's logical,\" Williams says.\n\nWilliams takes part in the Urine Nutrient Reclamation Program (UNRP), a programme run by the Rich Earth Institute (REI), a non-profit based in Vermont. She and 250 of her neighbours in Windham County donate a total of 12,000 gallons (45,400 litres) of urine to the programme each year to be recycled – or \"peecycled\".\n\nWindham County's pee-donations are collected by a lorry and driven to a large tank where the urine is pasteurised by heating it to 80C (176F) for 90 seconds. It is then stored in a pasteurised tank, ready to be sprayed on local farmland when the time is right to fertilise crops.\n\nRecords suggest that urine was used to help grow crops back in ancient China and ancient Rome. Today, scientists are finding that it can more than double the yield of crops like kale and spinach compared to no fertiliser, and improve yields even in low fertility soils.\n\nUrine's power as a fertiliser is due to the nitrogen and phosphorus that it contains – the same nutrients that are added to the synthetic fertilisers used on many conventional farms. But these synthetic fertilisers come at an environmental cost. Nitrogen is produced using the fossil fuel-intensive Haber-Bosch process, and the mining of phosphorus creates harmful amounts of toxic waste. Urine, meanwhile, is freely available – as Williams puts it, \"everybody pees. [It's an] untapped resource\".\n\nRich Earth Institute Urine's power as a fertiliser is due to the nitrogen and phosphorus that it contains (Credit: Rich Earth Institute)\n\nNancy Love, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan who has collaborated with the team at REI over the last decade, has found that using urine instead of standard synthetic fertiliser reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and requires around half the amount of water. Indeed, since 2012, UNRP estimates that it has conserved over 2.7 million gallons (10.2 million litres) of water through preventing toilet flushes.\n\n\"I've always been a systems thinker, and our [water] system has inefficiencies in it,\" Love says. \"What we do today is dilute the hell out of our urine, we put it in a pipe, we send it to a treatment plant, and then we pump a bunch more energy into it, just to send it back into the environment in a reactive form.\"\n\nIn the case of urine's nutrients, its typical destination is waterways. The nitrogen and phosphorus in urine are not fully removed from wastewater when it is treated. When these nutrients find their way into rivers and lakes, they are taken up by algae. The result can be algal blooms that choke up waterways, unbalancing the ecosystem and killing other species that live there.\n\n\"Our bodies create a lot of nutrients, and right now those nutrients are not only wasted, but they’re actually causing a lot of problems and harm downstream,\" says Jamina Shupack, REI's executive director.\n\nThese nutrients are food for algae – but also for crops. \"Wherever you put nitrogen, it's going to help plants grow. So if it's in the water, it's helping the algae grow. But if it's on the land, it's going to help plants grow,” Shupack explains. Because of this, diverting nutrient-rich urine away from waterways and onto the land can prevent harmful algal blooms while helping farmers grow food.\n\nEverybody pees. It's an untapped resource – Betsy Williams\n\nImportantly, the REI team and the farmers they work with take steps to minimise how much of the urine runs off the land and into waterways. Application is carefully timed, so that it happens when the plant is most able to take up the nutrients – typically during the plant's more active growth stage, when it's bigger than a seedling but not yet fruiting. The soil moisture is also measured, to make sure the liquid urine will be absorbed. Despite these efforts, \"that doesn't mean that there isn't going to be runoff\", Shupack says.\n\nEven so, she adds, peecycling reduces the overall amount of nutrients entering waterways because it ensures that runoff from the land is the only way excess nutrients enter rivers and lakes. In the current system, synthetic fertilisers run off into waterways, as well as urine entering rivers directly via wastewater.\n\nThe UNRP in Vermont is pioneering peecycling in the US, but projects in other countries are also underway. In Paris, volunteers are collecting urine to help save the River Seine and fertilise wheat for baguettes and biscuits. Swedish entrepreneurs saw the harm caused by algal blooms around the island of Gotland and came up with a product that collects urine and turns it into fertiliser. Peecycling pilots have also run in South Africa, Nepal and Niger Republic.\n\nRich Earth Institute Research shows that urine can more than double the yield of certain crops (Credit: Rich Earth Institute)\n\nBut expanding this work comes with challenges. Shupack says that in Vermont, farmers' demand for urine outstrips supply – but scaling up collection is tricky. Regulation can create a barrier, she says. \"A lot of times you go to a regulator and they say: 'We don't have a form for urine – the only place I know where to put urine is with biosolids, or within wastewater treatment.' So it's not really categorised in a way that would make sense to do what we're doing,\" she says.\n\nTo overcome this, Shupack says that REI have got to grips with the detailed language of regulations so they could spot possible paths and partnered with organisations with existing permits – such as septic haulers – to tackle the different parts of the process, and the permits needed, in a piecemeal way.\n\nEamon Twohig, programme manager at Vermont's Department of Environmental Conservation (VTDEC), tells the BBC that when REI initially approached them \"it was clear there was no 'regulatory box' for urine treatment/recycling… REI has certainly blazed a trail here in Vermont, and I think we've managed to find a workable, regulatory pathway.\"\n\nREI has a good relationship with regulators in Vermont, Shupack says, and has all the permits needed to operate – including one for innovative on-site wastewater management, and a waste-hauling permit for transporting urine. Now the organisation is working with partners in Massachusetts and Michigan to move regulation on. \"We're really trying to push that forward. But it's not always easy to get new environmental regulations updated,\" Shupack says. One of the biggest challenges, she adds, is that there is no legal distinction between human waste that has been separated at source, and combined wastewater flows that often come with greater safety concerns.\n\nThere are other limitations too. Urine is heavy and cumbersome to transport, and the lorries collecting and moving it create emissions. Currently the urine in Vermont is transported locally, no more than around 10 miles (16km). But expanding peecycling programmes could involve moving urine across bigger distances, so REI's spinoff company has developed a freeze concentration system that concentrates urine by six times, and is currently being used at the University of Michigan.\n\nCARBON COUNT The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nPlumbing, too, is a particular challenge. Love says that urine separation systems don't rely on flushing in the same way standard toilets do – which is great for reducing water use, but is difficult to achieve with current plumbing codes.\n\n\"There are solutions,\" Love says, \"like looped systems in a building. But what it means is the entire plumbing process in a building is different.\" This is something Love and her colleagues and partners are working on, so that new buildings in the US can have urine separation systems installed from the start. \"If we want any hope of sustainable water systems by the end of this century, we have to start getting the early adopters to look at these innovative solutions now,\" she says.\n\nRich Earth Institute The Rich Earth Institute collects a total of 12,000 gallons (45,400 litres) of urine each year (Credit: Rich Earth Institute)\n\nThese new systems will have the important goal of making urine donation effortless. Williams began her peecycling efforts using large laundry detergent bottles that travelled in the boot of her car to a central collection tank once a month. Once she was in the habit of collecting urine, Williams didn't like to let it go to waste. \"I didn't even like to go anywhere where I might have to pee and not have a jug with me. It kind of became part of my routine, sort of like wearing a seat belt,\" she says.\n\nEven so, she has enjoyed the recent installation of a toilet in her home that separates urine (at the front) from other waste (at the back). The urine travels to a tank in her basement, which is pumped out a couple of times each year by a lorry that visits Williams and others in her area that take part in the project. \"It's a nice change not dealing with the messy business of it. Making it easy for people is a biggie,\" Williams says.\n\nAvoiding mess is also likely to help tackle the \"ick factor\" when it comes to peecycling, says Williams. \"It's icky and it's smelly and it's something we don't talk about,\" she says. But while some may be put off by the idea of dealing with their own waste, REI's research suggests that the ick factor doesn't dominate people's reactions to peecycling. People tend to be open to the idea, Shupack says, but to think that others wouldn't be. \"It's this assumption that everyone else is going to think it's really gross. That initial ick factor is not as big of a deal as people assume it's going to be,\" says Shupack.\n\nMany people are, however, concerned about pharmaceutical content in the urine. \"It's the biggest question we get,\" Shupack says. REI has conducted research to find out just how much of common drugs like caffeine and the painkiller acetaminophen are evident in vegetables grown using urine fertiliser. The final results are yet to be released, but the preliminary findings suggest the amount of pharmaceuticals in vegetables fertilised with urine to be \"extremely small\". \"You'd have to eat a pretty obscene amount of lettuce, every day, for way longer than you can live\" to get a cup of coffee's worth of caffeine, Shupack says.\n\nHealth worries and messiness aside, Williams points out that it is our Western attitude to waste that most urgently needs to change. \"Particularly in [the US], people don't really think about where their waste goes. They think about it in terms of recycling and trash to some degree, but not so much in terms of human waste. It's a new frontier for people.\"\n\nClimate change and water pollution can feel like impossibly big issues, but Williams doesn't let them overwhelm her. Instead, she focuses on what she can do in a small way, in her own home. \"We can just do our part,\" she says. \"We aren't perfect, but we try to at least be responsible in terms of what happens to our bodily waste.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant. Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare. Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\n\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right – she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\n\nAlamy A 19th-Century painting by Marcus Stone of Edward II and Gaveston, showing them getting closer while courtiers look on (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe playwright never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\n\nWas Edward II gay?\n\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\n\nI think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay. But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay – Kathryn Warner\n\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\n\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\n\nHelen Murray The new RSC production of Edward II stars its co-artistic director Daniel Evans (pictured right), who believes the play is still radical (Credit: Helen Murray)\n\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\n\nBoundary-breaking productions\n\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\n\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\n\nAlamy Ian McKellen and James Laurenson's same-sex kiss on stage in a 1960s production of the play, which was later televised on the BBC, was a landmark moment (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\n\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her 2011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\n\nFact v fiction\n\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\n\nJoe Cocks Studio Collection/ Shakespeare Birthplace Trust Simon Russell Beale portrayed Edward II in the RSC's 1990 production, which reflected the era's gay politics (Credit: Joe Cocks Studio Collection/ Shakespeare Birthplace Trust)\n\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest. \"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\n\nI hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being – Daniel Evans\n\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\n\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\n\nAlamy Celebrated gay British filmmaker Derek Jarman made a film of Edward II, that mixed medieval and modern settings (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" – one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\n\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

How is it that just 20 minutes ago, the skies were grey and moody with the threat of an imminent downpour? In Sri Lanka's central highlands, the weather may be capricious but what remains unchanged is the sprawling expanse of tea estates in every direction.\n\nThis region is where the bulk of soothing Ceylon tea comes from. And the recently opened Pekoe Trail, Sri Lanka's first long-distance hiking trail that runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history. This hiking trail, divided into 22 stages, begins in Sri Lanka's second largest city of Kandy, close to the area where Scotsman James Taylor first planted tea in the country in the mid-1800s. After a long and circuitous route, it finally ends in the hill town of Nuwara Eliya, whose cool climes and misty slopes are said to have reminded the British colonisers of Blighty (Britain).\n\nThe trail has existed in patches since those initial days of tea cultivation in Sri Lanka, beginning as basic mud tracks that were used to transport the leaves to factories and then onward to domestic markets and Colombo port for export. For Pekoe Trail founder and sustainable tourism consultant Miguel Cunat, creating this multi-stage, multi-day hike was a labour of love, involving nearly 10 years of research and exploration.\n\n\"My initial objective was to promote Sri Lanka as a world-class hiking destination,\" says the Spaniard and long-time Sri Lanka resident, who was keen to put the small island back on the tourism map after a disastrous spell with Covid and the subsequent economic crisis. His efforts came to fruition with the official opening of the Pekoe Trail in late 2023, with initial funding from the European Union and USAID.\n\nCharukesi Ramadurai Tea processing factories dot the landscape, with Sri Lanka being the world's fourth largest exporter of tea (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai)\n\n\"The trails are fairly easy, at low elevation and open all through the year. In that sense, this hike is for everyone,\" he explains. That means everyone, including novice hikers such as myself, have the option to stay in a hotel near the trail and go out on exploratory day hikes within a single stage. I also come to understand later from my trail guides that most visitors choose to do this instead of attempting the trail in its entirety.\n\nSet Out Set Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\n\nAnd although tea is the common thread stitching this story together, each stage has its own unique elements – a colonial-era cricket club here, a seasonal waterfall there, statues of brightly coloured village deities, Anglican churches with brilliant stained-glass windows, distant views of a sharp peak or clusters of wildflowers blooming in the midst of a barren stretch. Cathy Cruse, a 62-year-old Australian hiker who recently set a record by completing the entire trail in seven days, agrees, saying, \"You've got the tea plantations and then you're going into thick jungle and then pine forests, and then at one stage I thought I was walking through Australia, with all the tall eucalyptus trees.\"\n\nCunat's objective was also to bring tourist attention and money into the hinterlands and hill towns located away from the popular coastal destinations of Sri Lanka's south or the Buddhist Cultural Triangle of Anuradhapura, Sigiriya and Dambulla. Cruse, who is married to a Sri Lankan, says that she has visited Kandy and Nuwara Eliya several times but never had a chance – or indeed, a reason – to explore the more interior parts of the tea country.\n\nAs Cunat walked along the various trails, he also began to see a larger picture emerging from the network of villages and communities along the way. \"Along with nature, there is so much history and living heritage, with local fairs and festivals, and opportunities to see how [rural Sri Lankans] live and work,\" he says. And it is this aspect I most enjoy about my hikes – I am never too far from civilisation, be it a local temple or a tea factory, and I get to have regular interactions with friendly plantation workers and curious children everywhere. It is perhaps why Cruse stresses how safe the trail is for solo or women hikers. \"When I pick a trail, I'm looking for somewhere safe that a woman can tackle on her own and not feel intimidated. Not once did I ever feel nervous of my surroundings or my guides on the Pekoe Trail,\" she says.\n\nCharukesi Ramadurai Many tea plantation workers are descended from the Indian-Tamils brought to Sri Lanka by the British (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai)\n\nThe history of tea in Sri Lanka is inextricably linked with the Indian-Tamil plantation workers brought by the British. Their descendants – mostly women – still form the backbone of the lowest levels of tea production. Dressed in frayed button-down shirts and thick long skirts to protect from leeches, they spend their lives picking the finest leaves from the bushes. I see them walking up and down the tea estates, their hands nimble with years of practice, their necks bent with the load of the bamboo baskets tied to their heads, into which they carefully toss the leaves.\n\nThe best of 2025 Sri Lanka was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list here.\n\nThe women beam in delight when I speak to them in Tamil. \"Tell me about India,\" third-generation tea picker Sathyavathy demands, when I stop to chat with her group during their mid-morning tea break in the Bogawantalawa area, known as the \"Golden Valley\" due to its fine quality of tea. \"Is it beautiful?\" Like many of her peers, she has distant family back in the small towns of Tamil Nadu in South India but has never visited the country.\n\nMy initial hikes take me through stages seven and eight near Hatton in the heart of the tea country, dotted with old factories that still process tea using dated technology, and boutique hotels repurposed from massive bungalows once meant for estate managers. My guide here is Dharsharuban Rathnasingham, a young man whose grandparents and mother used to work in these very tea plantations.\n\nRuban – as he likes being called – is passionate about sharing the stories of his people, Indian Tamils who populate the villages and towns around the various stages of the Pekoe Trail. As we walk, he stops to point out the elements distinctive to tea plantation life, like the \"line rooms\", cramped barrack-style quarters where large families lived together (and still do, in some places); and the statues of fierce Tamil protector deities placed at major crossroads or beneath trees, often depicted riding a horse or wielding a scythe.\n\nCharukesi Ramadurai The Nine Arch bridge near Ella is a popular spot for hikers on Trail 16 (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai)\n\nFrom Hatton, I take the famed Colombo to Badulla train to Ella, from where I attempt to tackle stages 15 and 16 over the next several days, taking in the viewpoint known as Ella Rock and the picturesque nine-arch railway bridge. Here, the tea goes in and out of view, with some stretches taking me over active railway tracks and others on paths shaded by tall eucalyptus and pine trees. The Pekoe Trail may be long and even tough in parts, but it is never boring or monotonous.\n\nAs Cruse says, \"There were just so many 'wow' moments during the hike, where you come around a corner, and the whole valley would just be laid out below and I would have to stop and just stare.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Israel looks to negotiate extension of ceasefire deal with Hamas\n\nWashington, D.C. — The Trump administration has approved a major nearly $3 billion arms sale to Israel, bypassing a normal congressional review to provide the country with more of the 2,000-pound bombs that it has used in its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIn a series of notifications sent to Congress late Friday, the State Department said it had signed off on the sale of more than 35,500 MK 84 and BLU-117 bombs and 4,000 Predator warheads worth $2.04 billion.\n\nThe State Department approved Israel's purchase of Caterpillar D9 Bulldozers and related equipment for an estimated cost of $295 million. Deliveries by the Irving, Texas-based company are expected to begin in 2027.\n\nThe Defense Security Cooperation released a statement confirming a munitions sale to Israel for an estimated cost of $675.7 million. Repkon USA, located in Tampa, Florida, and The Boeing Company, located in St. Charles, Missouri, will manufacture the equipment, which is estimated to be delivered to Israel beginning in 2028.\n\nOn Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he had \"signed a declaration to use emergency authorities to expedite the delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel.\"\n\nRubio noted that the Trump administration has so far approved nearly $12 billion in foreign military sales to Israel.\n\nThe latest arms sale comes as the first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of war, freed Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and enabled more humanitarian aid to reach Gaza, is set to expire on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel and Hamas seem willing to maintain their truce while negotiators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar guide talks aimed at getting to the next phase.\n\nThe parties were supposed to have begun ironing out the details of phase two weeks ago. But talks were delayed as the first six weeks of the ceasefire were marred by disputes between Israel and Hamas over alleged violations of the deal.\n\nUnder the terms of the truce that began in Jan. 19, the second phase would compel Hamas to release all the remaining living hostages from its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that triggered the war, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners in Israel, a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\n\nOver the past six weeks, Hamas has freed 33 living and dead hostages in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners. The militant group still holds 59 captives, 32 of whom are believed to be dead.\n\nIsrael is reportedly seeking an extension of the first phase to secure the freedom of more captives.",

        "content": "What we know about the U.S. pause on cyber operations against Russia\n\nMultiple U.S. officials tell CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a directive to U.S. Cyber Command last month to pause planning against Russia, including provocative offensive cyber operations.\n\nThe duration of the pause is unclear and comes amid President Trump's efforts to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. Hegseth's order was handed down before Mr. Trump sparred with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office late last week.\n\nTwo sources familiar with Hegseth's directive said it lacked specificity about the pause.\n\nAnd, it's not clear how the order about planning was interpreted. Strategizing for future operations was never paused, multiple officials told CBS. U.S. cyber policy on Russia \"is very much intact\" and remains at the same level, one of the officials said.\n\nThe directive was first reported by The Record, a cybersecurity news publication.\n\nDuring previous sensitive negotiations, past Democratic and Republican administrations have paused certain operations to prevent U.S. intentions from being misconstrued and keep diplomacy on track.\n\nAsked for comment, a senior U.S. defense official said, \"Due to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations. There is no greater priority to Secretary Hegseth than the safety of the Warfighter in all operations, to include the cyber domain.\"\n\nNSC spokesperson Brian Hughes declined to comment on specific orders or cyber intelligence or operations.\n\n\"There's absolutely a steadfast commitment from President Trump, national security adviser Waltz and the entire administration that America's safety and our national security are never going to be compromised,\" Hughes said.\n\nAsked about temporary halt in planning and cyber operations on Sunday's \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio said, \"I'm unaware of that. I don't believe — there are too many, I'm certain, considerations there for that to be an accurate statement so blanket.\"\n\nWhen pressed, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and is the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said, \"Considering what I know, what Russia is currently doing against the United States, that would I'm certain not be an accurate statement of the current status of the Unites States operations.\"\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union,\" national security adviser Mike Waltz said he was also unaware of the directive. Asked whether there were talks about pausing offensive cyber operations against Russia, Waltz said, \"That has not been part of our discussions. There will be all kinds of carrots and sticks to get this war to an end.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Haifa, Israel — A stabbing in the northern Israeli city of Haifa left one person and the attacker dead, authorities said Monday, in the first such fatal incident since the Gaza ceasefire began in January. The knife attack came just one day after Israel blocked aid to the Gaza Strip amid an impasse with Hamas over how to extend the ceasefire in the decimated Palestinian territory.\n\nThe six-week first phase of the truce ended on Saturday. It had enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance for the roughly 2 million people living in Gaza and the return of 33 Israeli hostages, both dead and alive. But there was nothing immediately agreed upon to keep the relative peace.\n\nNegotiations for a second phase of the deal have not started yet as intended, and Israel insisted over the weekend on an intermediary measure it has attributed to the Trump administration, which would significantly change the rough terms of the agreement that were initially discussed.\n\nThe Israeli decision to halt the entry of all aid to Gaza drew a call from the United Nations and many Arab nations in the region for an immediate restoration of the truck convoys.\n\nA deadly attack in Haifa\n\nMonday's attack happened at a bus and train station in Haifa, a large coastal city in northern Israel that is home to a mixed Jewish and Arab population. Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service said it had pronounced dead a man aged about 70 and treated four other wounded people.\n\nPolice called it a terrorist attack and said the perpetrator was killed, but there were unconfirmed reports suggesting the man could have been inadvertently hit by a bullet fired by Israeli security forces responding to the knife attack.\n\nIsraeli first responders work next to the body of a man killed during a suspected stabbing attack in Haifa, northern Israel, March 3, 2025. Rami Shlush/REUTERS\n\nAfter Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to Hamas' unprecedented terrorist assault, repeated attacks — often involving knives — saw people killed or wounded in Israel. Until Monday, however, the Gaza ceasefire had coincided with a halt to such attacks within Israel, as violence largely subsided in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nPolice identified the assailant on Monday as a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority who had recently returned from another, unspecified country.\n\nHamas lauded the attack in Haifa, calling it a response to purported Israeli crimes \"in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, including killing, destruction and displacement in the northern West Bank, the siege on Gaza, projects to displace Palestinians from the Jordan Valley, and the desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque.\"\n\nThe U.S., European Union and Israeli-designated terrorist group called on \"our people in the West Bank, Jerusalem, and inside Israel to escalate the confrontation with the enemy and engage them using all available means.\"\n\nBoth Israel and Palestinian sources on Sunday reported fresh Israeli military strikes in Gaza, where the health ministry reported at least four people were killed.\n\nNetanyahu pushes new terms with Hamas under apparent U.S. proposal\n\nMediators Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement along with the U.S., have accused Israel of blatantly violating the ceasefire deal by halting the aid convoys — a move that left trucks loaded with goods lined up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.\n\nThe first six-week phase of the truce also saw the exchange of prisoners and hostages between Israel and Hamas. Of the 251 captives taken during Hamas' attack, Israel says 59 are still being held in Gaza, of whom at least 35 are dead.\n\nEarly on Sunday Israel's government said it wanted to extend the first phase of the ceasefire until mid-April — a stopgap measure that it said President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed. Netanyahu said Hamas must accept the new proposal and hand over half of the remaining hostages immediately, before any negotiations begin on a second phase of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nHamas has repeatedly rejected an extension, instead favoring a transition to the truce deal's second phase that could bring a permanent end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, as envision in the deal negotiated by the U.S. and its regional partners.\n\nHamas called Netanyahu's \"decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the (ceasefire) agreement.\"\n\nEgypt and Qatar, along with Saudi Arabia and Jordan, denounced Israel's aid decision.\n\nThe European Union condemned what it called Hamas' refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel's subsequent aid block \"risked humanitarian consequences.\"\n\nBrussels called for \"a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire.\"\n\nHamas sparked the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which saw the group kill more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage. Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 48,300 people in the Palestinian enclave, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.\n\nThe war has also destroyed or damaged most buildings in Gaza, displaced almost the entire population and triggered widespread hunger, according to the U.N.\n\nNetanyahu's office said Sunday that he had \"decided that, from this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be suspended,\" accusing the group of multiple violations of the ceasefire during phase-one, and of controlling the humanitarian aid that had entered the territory thus far and \"turning it into a budget for terrorism directed against\" Israel.\n\n\"In Witkoff's plan, half of the hostages would be released right away and the remaining half would be released if we reach an agreement on a permanent ceasefire,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"Israel has accepted this plan. I accepted this plan. But so far, Hamas has rejected it.\"\n\nHis government warned there would be \"consequences\" for Hamas if it did not accept the temporary truce extension.\n\nUnder the first phase of the ceasefire, Gaza militants handed over 25 living hostages and eight bodies in exchange for about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\n\nIn Jerusalem late Sunday, AFP images showed protesters outside Netanyahu's residence calling on their government to make a deal that would bring home the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\nNetanyahu's critics in Israel have regularly blamed him for delays throughout the months of truce negotiations.\n\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the far-right faction in Netanyahu's governing coalition, has threatened to quit if the war is not resumed, a move that would likely precipitate national elections and force Netanyahu to seek a new mandate at a time when the Israeli electorate is deeply divided over his handling of the hostage crisis.\n\nThe prime minister is also on trial for corruption charges, which he denies, and on Monday he appeared in court to testify in the case, video images from the court showed.",

        "content": "What to expect from Trump's address to joint session of Congress\n\nWashington — President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight, marking the first time he will speak before both chambers since he returned to office six weeks ago.\n\nPresidents typically address a joint session of Congress early in their tenure to outline a vision or agenda. The first speech before lawmakers is not technically a State of the Union, but rather an Address to a Joint Session of Congress.\n\nAs is customary, House Speaker Mike Johnson in January invited Mr. Trump to address Congress and \"share his America First vision for our future.\" In a letter to the president, the speaker wrote that the Trump administration and the Republican majorities in Congress will \"have the chance to make these next four years some of the most consequential in our nation's history.\"\n\n\"America's Golden Age has begun,\" Johnson said in the letter, echoing a line from Mr. Trump's inaugural address, while touting a \"resurgence of patriotism, unity, and hope for the future.\"\n\nWhat time will Trump's speech start and end?\n\nThe president's address is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET. Its running time remains to be seen. During his first term, Mr. Trump's 2017 joint address to Congress ran about one hour. Over the next three years, his State of the Union addresses averaged 80 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nPresident Trump applauds while delivering a State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 30, 2018.

Find your local CBS station here.\n\nWhere to stream Trump's speech without cable\n\nStream CBS News' coverage for free on CBS News 24/7, available on CBSNews.com, the CBS News app and Paramount+.\n\nContext to know for Trump's address to Congress\n\nMr. Trump's address to Congress comes six weeks after he returned to office for a second term. So far, Americans agree that he is making major changes to how the government works, though there's a divide on whether they view the changes as better or worse, according to CBS News polling released Sunday.\n\nThe president has pursued a dramatic overhaul of the federal bureaucracy and a cost-cutting effort alongside Elon Musk, who he's tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. DOGE has been working with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce, while halting swaths of government spending. A number of Democrats are bringing former government employees fired as a result of the DOGE cuts as their guests to Tuesday's address to highlight the individuals personally impacted.\n\nThe Trump administration in its first six weeks has also worked to bolster border security with a government-wide immigration crackdown, and illegal border crossings were significantly down during Mr. Trump's first month in office. Still, the administration has faced obstacles in its efforts to conduct what it's billed as the largest deportation operation in American history in the U.S. interior. Top Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been reassigned in recent weeks amid frustrations that the agency has not carried out sufficient arrests and deportations. ICE's detention capacity has also been stretched thin, with detention centers recently filled at levels above 110%.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump's approach to immigration has received support in recent polling, Americans overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy. At the same time, the president has pursued tariffs that have prompted fears of a trade war among businesses and consumers. On Tuesday, 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico go into effect following a month-long delay.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in Congress have been pursuing legislation to support Mr. Trump's agenda, facing headwinds with a narrow majority in the House and differing views on the path forward. Last week, the House adopted a budget resolution that paves the way for implementing the president's agenda on border security, defense and energy priorities, while extending the 2017 tax cuts. But it's not yet clear how the budget blueprint will fare in the Senate, where lawmakers have pursued a different approach.\n\nMr. Trump's return to the White House has also had serious implications on the world stage even in the first six weeks. Last week, a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into a feud with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and Zelenskyy was ultimately asked to leave the White House without signing a critical multibillion-dollar rare earth minerals deal. On Monday, the White House said it was pausing military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe contentious meeting came after Mr. Trump had appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with billions in weapons since the Russian invasion three years ago, and a split with Zelenskyy may have major implications for its ability to defend itself.",

It adds that a person's sex \"shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\"\n\nThe House passed a similar Republican-led measure in January, with two Democrats joining the Republican majority.\n\nLast month, President Trump signed an executive order to ban transgender girls and women from competing on female sports teams. Schools not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive. The order also affects U.S. visa policies for athletes who travel to the country to compete in the Olympics or other sporting events.\n\nThose in favor of the bans contend that transgender athletes have biological advantages that are unfair and unsafe for other girls and women. Opponents of such policies have argued that a ban opens the door to intrusive genital examinations of girls, particularly those who do not fit stereotypical feminine appearances.\n\nPolling in recent years has found a lack of support for transgender athletes participating on sports teams that match their gender identity. About half of states limit transgender athlete participation.",

He has been posting on social media about crime in Washington, D.C., using the hashtag #MarchBadness. Martin, whose nomination for the permanent post of U.S. attorney for D.C. is being considered by the Senate, has been attracting attention with his social media posts, as well as some of his actions in his capacity as acting U.S. attorney.\n\nIn one on Saturday, Martin wrote, \"Hey, thugs with guns, you hear that? Yup, we comin.'\"\n\nHe was likely referring to a memo circulated Monday to his staff, in which Martin said over a dozen agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be dispatched to help with an \"amazing opportunity\" to help initiatives to reduce violent crime in the nation's capital.\n\nFILE - Ed Martin speaks at an event hosted by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., at the Capitol in Washington, June 13, 2023. Amanda Andrade-Rhoades / AP\n\nMartin's new initiative seeks more federal district court prosecutions of Washington, D.C., gun crimes. His memo, obtained by CBS News, said his office is \"kicking off the Make DC Safe Again initiative,\" which echoes the Make America Great Again slogan invoked by Trump.\n\n\"We are following the direction of President Trump and (Attorney) General Bondi in the recent executive orders and memoranda. We will flood the federal district court with cases—to make our city safe,\" the memo said. This has been attempted before. In February 2019, a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor announced a project to seek higher-level charges for gun cases in the District of Columbia.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. and the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives D.C. field office declined requests for comment.\n\nWhile he waits for his confirmation vote, Martin has continued to court controversy with provocative social posts.\n\nIn a social media post Saturday, Martin wrote that his predecessor was a \"Biden prosecutor\" who \"upped political prosecutions, he steered resources to a now-debunked legal theory that targeted American citizens, and gun prosecutions went down. Literally. Let me be clear: he used our $ to chase political hoaxes while the people of DC were terrorized by thugs with guns.\"\n\nThe U.S. attorney for the D.C. has a unique ability to handle federal crimes in the nation's capital, including those involving federal officials and facilities. As U.S. attorney for D.C., Martin days ago demoted a group of top senior prosecutors in the office to entry level positions, including those who helped with the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection prosecutions. Now, at least some are being assigned to handle misdemeanor cases\n\nHis demotions have caused internal dissension, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News.\n\nMartin has filed a series of court motions to help promptly close out many of the pending Capitol riot prosecutions. Before his appointment, Martin served as a defense attorney for Capitol riot defendants and was an active member of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, which promoted baseless claims of election fraud in 2020.\n\nLast month, Martin instructed his staff to respond to surveys, seeking information about \"five things\" they'd accomplished that week, from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Martin also instructed staff to respond to the second survey that was emailed over the weekend.\n\nMartin is also under new scrutiny by congressional Democrats after writing a social media post last month in which he referred to U.S. attorneys as \"Trump's lawyers,\" who are \"vigilant in standing against entities like the [Associated Press] that refuse to put America first.\"\n\nBut U.S. attorneys are not the president's lawyers. Their mission is to ensure that federal laws are enforced. In their districts, they're also involved in civil litigations where the U.S. is a party.\n\nMartin also posted a note to the law firm Covington & Burling and former special counsel Jack Smith to \"save your receipts\" and promised, \"We'll be in touch soon.\" The message included a link to a story noting the firm was defending Smith pro bono. Smith indicted President Trump in two separate cases.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer praised Martin in a statement, saying, \"By nominating Ed Martin to be the next U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, President Donald Trump wasted no time delivering on his promise to restore law and order in our capital city.\"\n\nBut Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who is the ranking member on the committee, has launched an investigation into Martin's initiatives and actions as acting U.S. attorney. He wrote a letter to Martin questioning his public statements which, he said, \"are directed exclusively at opponents of and express support for the Trump Administration, explicitly criticize the Biden Administration, publicize pending investigative activity by your office, and make assertions of fact for which there exists no evidence.\"\n\nMartin's statements \"raise serious concerns that your new initiative is a pretext for misusing your office for political ends, threatening and intimidating critics of the Administration, and chilling constitutionally protected speech,\" Connolly added.\n\nA spokesperson for Martin declined to comment.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee Democrats' inquiry ordered Martin to submit responses by March 11 about how the office would seek to protect the safety of Capitol police officers and federal prosecutors who were part of the Jan. 6 prosecutions. The inquiry also asks Martin to \"confirm your belief that the Department of Justice represents the United States of America and its citizens, and not the personal and individual political or business interests of the President.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "President Trump announced on Monday a pause in the provision of billions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Ukraine — aid that had been promised by former President Biden before he left office. It will affect deliveries of ammunition and other vital supplies as Ukraine fights to defend itself from Russia's ongoing, three-year full-scale invasion that has seen President Vladimir Putin's forces occupy roughly 20% of eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe aid pause came after Friday's contentious Oval Office meeting that descended into an unprecedented televised spectacle as President Trump and Vice President JD Vance belittled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of failing to express sufficient gratitude and disrespecting the U.S. presidency.\n\n\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News on Monday. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"\n\nThat reaction by Mr. Trump is a nightmare scenario for Ukraine, and it could have real consequences not only for Zelenskyy's forces on the ground, but for all of Europe. It was a dramatic ratcheting up of Mr. Trump's campaign to pile pressure on Zelenskyy to pursue a peace deal with Putin — but on terms that Ukraine has so far deemed untenable, with no offer of a U.S. guarantee to protect Ukraine from future attacks by its much larger, authoritarian neighbor.\n\nThe announcement was met with immediate trepidation in Ukraine, but quickly welcomed by Moscow, where Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it \"a decision that could actually push the Kyiv regime toward a peace process.\"\n\n\"It is obvious that, until now, the U.S. has been the main supplier of this war,\" Peskov said. \"If the U.S. stops that or suspends these supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to [achieving] peace.\"\n\n\"Ukraine will still fight,\" but it needs help\n\nIn Ukraine, Mr. Trump's move sent shockwaves across the war-battered country.\n\nAsked if Ukraine stands a chance of repelling Russia's invasion without the support of the U.S. and Mr. Trump, Mykhailo Podolyak, a top advisor to Zelenskyy, declined to predict the outcome, but didn't waiver about Ukraine's determination to defend its sovereignty.\n\n\"What I can say for sure is that Ukraine will still fight. But I will ask you a question,\" he told CBS News. \"Would [the U.S.] be okay to stay on the sidelines when we need to stop Russian aggression? And what does Russia want to do? It wants to destroy the world that was built by previous American administrations.\"\n\nIt's a world President Trump has never signaled clearly that he is willing to defend. But Ukrainian soldiers wounded on the battlefield told CBS News in a military trauma ward in Kyiv, that they are.\n\nOleksiy, a grandfather and volunteer soldier in his 50s, was being treated for shrapnel wounds to his legs and hips from Russian shelling. He also suffered a war wound to his arm a year ago, but he went back to fight.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, when asked if he would continue fighting when he healed, with or without support from Washington. \"For the sake of my granddaughter.\"\n\nAs Ukrainian leaders consider what to do next, they will have to turn increasingly to their partners in Europe, who already provide just over 50% of the military assistance Ukraine receives. European leaders have vowed in recent days to step up that support — dramatically — as Russia's assault rages on.\n\nHighlighting the importance of that support, Russian forces launched nearly 100 explosive drones at the Ukrainian cities of Sumy and Odessa overnight.\n\nOne Ukrainian official told CBS News the country could sustain itself militarily for up to six months without further U.S. military aid, but that would be dependent on the severity of Russian attacks.\n\nUkraine's president has warned for years, even before Russia launched its full-scale invasion after insisting for months that it had no intention of doing so, that if Putin is not stopped in his tracks, he will keep pushing to claw back more of the territory Russia lost when the Soviet Union collapsed — and the Russian autocrat has made no secret about his perception of both NATO and Europe as hostile entities.\n\n\"We hear his [Trump's] statement about the desire to bring peace to Ukraine. This can only be welcomed,\" Peskov said Tuesday. \"But we will continue to watch how the situation develops in reality.\"\n\nCBS News' Sohel Uddin and Emmet Lyons contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Will Europe fill security gaps against Russia if U.S. pulls back from aiding Ukraine?\n\nEuropean Union leadership announced a plan Tuesday to shore up the continent's collective defense by significantly boosting military spending, hours after President Trump said the U.S. was suspending all its military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"We are in an era of rearmament,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told journalists on Tuesday while announcing the plan — called \"ReArm Europe\" — which she said would allow European countries to access the equivalent of $840 billion to spend on defense in the coming years.\n\nOne way it would do this is by allowing EU countries to spend more on defense without triggering EU mechanisms against budget deficits, Von der Leyen said. Another way would be through EU loans worth around $158 billion for EU member states.\n\n\"It will help Member States to pool demand and to buy together,\" Von der Leyen said. \"With this equipment, Member States can massively step up their support to Ukraine… This approach of joint procurement will also reduce costs, reduce fragmentation, increase interoperability and strengthen our defense industrial base.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen delivers a statement on plans to strengthen the European defence industry and the EU's military capabilities, in Brussels, Belgium March 4, 2025. Yves Herman / REUTERS\n\nVon der Leyen also proposed using the EU bloc's collective budget to help increase defense spending, and to mobilize private capital.\n\nThe announcement comes 48 hours before a scheduled summit of EU leaders, where Von der Leyen's proposals will be discussed.\n\n\"Europe is ready to assume its responsibilities,\" Von der Leyen said. \"We will continue working closely with our partners in NATO. This is a moment for Europe. And we are ready to step up.\"\n\nNATO not consulted on Trump's move, Poland says\n\nEuropean leaders woke up to the news that Mr. Trump had suspended all military aid to Ukraine without any prior notice, Poland's foreign ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski said Tuesday.\n\nWronski told journalists Mr. Trump had made the decision, \"without informing, nor consulting\" his NATO allies, adding: \"It is a very important decision and the situation is very serious.\"\n\nIreland's leader Michael Martin called the move by Mr. Trump a \"serious setback\" to achieving peace, stressing that Ukrainians, \"have shown extraordinary resilience, extraordinary courage in terms of meeting an illegal invasion.\"\n\n\"Europe is very conscious, also, of the fact that there are many other states across Europe who fear Russian aggression and Russian ambition, and those countries see this as an existential threat to their sovereignty,\" Martin said. \"The European Union is very, very conscious of that, and that is what is motivating the European Union in its continued strong support of Ukraine, because this is a broader European issue.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said Europe \"cannot allow Russia's aggressive policy, which threatens us all, to succeed. The era of relying on others to address fundamental international challenges on our behalf is over. Now is the time for Europe to move decisively from words to action.\"\n\nWill Trump's move \"encourage Putin to ask for more\"?\n\nMr. Trump's decision to suspend U.S. military aid to Ukraine \"will encourage Putin to ask for more — including Ukrainian demilitarization and neutrality,\" Malcolm Chalmers, Deputy Director-General of the Royal United Services Institute military think tank, predicted Tuesday.\n\nChalmers said the \"nightmare scenario\" would be for the United States and Russia to announce a peace deal, \"and then tell Ukraine and Europe to 'take it or leave it.'\"\n\nRecent estimates show only about 20% of military hardware supplied to Ukraine is from the United States, with 25% provided by Europe and the rest of the world and 55% produced in Ukraine, Chalmers said. But the 20% provided by the U.S., he said, is \"the most lethal and important.\"\n\n\"What will count most of all is how far the U.K. and Europe are prepared to help Ukraine in defiance of the U.S.,\" Chalmers said. \"Ukraine will not collapse [without U.S. military aid] – they already experienced an aid cutoff last year, but the effect will be cumulative.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "An Oval Office showdown between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would have been cheered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as Mr. Trump's national security adviser during his first administration.\n\nThe U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia and provided aid to Ukraine after the war began but last month, Mr. Trump flipped U.S. policy on its head. He opened peace talks with Russia, which occupies 20% of Ukraine while bombing the rest, and did not invite Ukraine. Then on Friday, he berated Zelenskyy during an explosive Oval Office meeting.\n\n\"Vladimir Putin couldn't be happier,\" McMaster, who is a CBS News contributor and author of \"At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House,\" said. \"Because what he sees is all of the pressure on Zelenskyy, all of the pressure on Ukraine and no pressure on him.\"\n\nTrump and Russia\n\nDuring his Friday Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump revealed something of a common cause with the Russian president. Mr. Trump complained that he and Putin had both been slandered for years by allegations that Russia helped Mr. Trump's campaigns, allegations the U.S. president ties to his Democratic opponents.\n\n\"Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nMcMaster, who was ousted by Mr. Trump in 2018, said Putin has manipulated many world leaders, including the U.S. commander in chief.\n\n60 Minutes\n\n\"He appeals to President Trump's sense of aggrievement, right? That, you know, 'Donald, you know, like me, you know, you've been treated so unfairly,'\" McMaster said. \"And he's been very successful at it because he's a master manipulator and one of the best liars in the world.\"\n\nThe president, McMaster said, is being played.\n\n\"And he's being played like other presidents have been played, like other leaders have been played, through that same playbook of Putin's,\" McMaster said.\n\nFact-checking President Trump's claims on Ukraine\n\nMr. Trump, who's boasted that only he can end the war quickly, has repeatedly made false claims about Ukraine. Last month, he suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, saying \"You should never have started it.\"\n\nUkraine did not start the war. Fighting erupted just over three years ago with Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe president also said the U.S. gave $350 billion toward Ukraine. It's $122 billion, according to Kiel Institute data.\n\nHe's also gone after Zelenskyy.\n\n\"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,\" Mr. Trump said on Feb. 19 in a Truth Social post.\n\nZelenskyy is not a dictator. He was elected in 2019. There hasn't been a vote since because of the war.\n\nMcMaster addressed some of Mr. Trump's claims on Zelenskyy and Ukraine in recent weeks.\n\n\"Well, President Trump, as we all know, has a tendency to say outlandish things. Sometimes that's to shake the situation up,\" he said.\n\nThe shifting U.S. relationship with Ukraine\n\nMr. Trump also doesn't always consider how his words could hurt his agenda or how they could be received abroad, McMaster said.\n\n\"War really is a contest of wills, and I think what you're seeing is Donald Trump delivering a series of body blows to the Ukrainians in a way that could affect, you know, their will to continue to fight,\" McMaster said.\n\nUkraine's allies were likely confused by the meeting, according to McMaster.\n\n\"They think, you know, 'How can President Trump be berating the leader of Ukraine while he says kind things about Vladimir Putin?\"\n\nImmediately after the Oval Office fight, many Republicans rallied around the president. On X, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said America was \"disrespected\" during the Oval Office meeting. He said he was proud of both the president and vice president for \"standing up for America First.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X: \"Thank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America First. America is with you!\"\n\nBut some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns. Republican Rep. Don Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, stood by Ukraine when he spoke with 60 Minutes before the Oval Office fight.\n\nRep. Don Bacon 60 Minutes\n\n\"America's the leader of the free world. We're the indispensable power. Nobody can stand up to Russia and China if we're not a part of that. And Ukraine's the victim,\" Bacon said. \"And I think Putin has made clear that he wants to reestablish his old borders and that's not in our national security interest. So, to me, this is a national security issue, also a moral issue.\"\n\nHe said it appears as though Mr. Trump is appeasing Putin.\n\n\"I don't know his motives. Some people think he's doin' this for negotiating and maybe he'll get a better deal. I don't know,\" Bacon said. \"All I know is what he says, and when he says that Russia is not the invader, that it's Ukraine's fault, that's just wrong.\"\n\nWhile other Republican lawmakers rushed to condemn President Zelenskyy after the Oval Office meeting, calling him disrespectful to President Trump, Bacon stood by Ukraine's president, saying on social media that this was \"A bad day for America's foreign policy. Ukraine wants independence, free markets and rule of law. It wants to be part of the West. Russia hates us and our Western values. We should be clear that we stand for freedom.\"\n\nSen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine serving on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, said he was ashamed when the U.S. recently sided with Russia at the United Nations, joining Russia in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution.\n\n\"I always try to think of, you know, what's the argument on both sides? I cannot think of a rational argument for pulling our support from Ukraine,\" King told 60 Minutes.\n\nKing likes to point out that Europe has given more to Ukraine than the U.S. and Ukraine has given the most.\n\n\"They've done the dying. All they've asked for us is to send them the means to defend themselves,\" he said.\n\nKing called for members of Congress to speak up.\n\n\"Because if we persist in walking away from Ukraine, it will be the greatest geopolitical mistake that this country's made since World War II,\" he said.",

        "content": "What to know about the wildfires in North and South Carolina\n\nWhat to know about the Carolina wildfires\n\nWhat to know about the Carolina wildfires\n\nAt least 17 wildfires were actively burning Monday in North and South Carolina, where blazes that erupted over the weekend forced evacuations and a state of emergency. The largest of them, in the Carolina Forest area near Myrtle Beach, spread over 1,600 acres in just a couple of days and remained largely uncontained as of officials' latest updates.\n\nEfforts were underway to contain the fires across both Carolinas. Here are maps illustrating the current situation.\n\nMaps of Carolina fires\n\nNorth Carolina Forest Service\n\nOfficials listed more than 200 wildfires in North Carolina early Monday, covering almost 2,100 acres of land, according to the North Carolina Forest Service. That figure accounted for both reported fires and confirmed ones, and the latter group included active blazes along with others considered contained or controlled. A contained wildfire is one that still burns but is no longer spreading, while a controlled fire has been extinguished.\n\nThe forest service was continuously updating an interactive map to chart the locations and basic characteristics of each fire, marking active incidents in red and reported incidents in green. Contained and controlled fires were marked brown and gray, respectively.\n\nA wildfire in southwestern North Carolina was the largest in the state, having spread more than 400 acres in Polk County near the South Carolina border, according to the forest service. Fire officials had contained 30% of the blaze as of Monday — a significant jump from zero containment reported a day earlier.\n\nSouth Carolina Forestry Commission\n\nAnother 112 wildfires were registered Monday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission, which also released a map to show where blazes have started around the state. Like their northern neighbor, fire officials included reported, active, contained and controlled fires in the list. At least six wildfires were actively burning, although there were at least three other active blazes reported and not yet confirmed.\n\nWhere are the fires in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina?\n\nA massive blaze engulfed at least 1,600 acres in Horry County, South Carolina, stemming from a forest fire that first erupted Saturday when brush lit up in flames as a dry spell coincided with unusually warm temperatures. Residents of several neighborhoods in the Carolina Forest, about 10 miles west of the oceanside resort city Myrtle Beach, were ordered to evacuate after the fire broke out.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency.\n\nFirefighters were able to contain 30% of the blaze by Sunday afternoon, after planes and a Black Hawk helicopter were seen dumping water onto the fire earlier in the morning. Ground crews were also seen using tractors to dig lines around the wildfire's perimeter.\n\nHorry County officials permitted evacuees to return to their homes on Sunday, but the county's fire rescue service warned that any residents previously ordered to leave the area should remain cautious of potential weather changes to come, and urged them to \"watch for possible rekindling of hot spots.\"\n\nOne-third of the fire remained contained on Monday, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission.\n\nHow big are the Carolina wildfires?\n\nBlazes in Polk County, North Carolina, and near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on Monday were the biggest in each state by far.\n\nThe Polk County fire was the second-largest between both Carolinas, covering between 400 and 500 acres of land. Exact figures differed slightly between the North Carolina Forest Service and Polk County Emergency Management, with the forest service listing its size at 400 acres and local crews estimating it had grown overnight to 481 acres.\n\nAnother fire in central North Carolina's Harnett County, near Fayetteville, was burning over 175 acres of land on Monday, the North Carolina Forest Service said. Almost all of that fire had been contained.",

And if you're financing your vehicle, specifically, the lender may have additional coverage requirements to meet, too.\n\nHowever, finding affordable car insurance is becoming more difficult as rates continue to spike. Car insurance rates were up 2.2% in January from the month prior, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. On an annual basis, rates rose 11.8% in January 2025 compared to the year prior. This has forced consumers to make difficult decisions, choosing between coverage they need versus what they can afford.\n\nDespite the rate increase, it's important to find coverage that fits your needs. Below, we'll break down what factors are affecting costs and how to find the best auto insurance for your situation.\n\nStart exploring your top car insurance options here today.\n\nWhat's driving up auto insurance costs?\n\nCar insurance rates have gone up significantly due to a multitude of factors. While it's easy to point to inflation and your driving record, what is increasing rates is a lot more nuanced.\n\n\"We're in a hard market for insurance. Premiums are up, guidelines are tightened, eligibility is harder now than ever before,\" says Colleen Parsons, an independent insurance broker with World Insurance Associates.\n\nParsons notes that increased litigation, personal injury settlements, and even car parts are hiking up car insurance costs. That's on top of the more traditional factors affecting auto insurance premiums.\n\n\"Rising costs of car repairs, car prices, medical expenses are what premiums pay. As these costs increase, so will car insurance rates. If tariffs on cars cause car prices to increase, so will insurance rates even more in the coming year,\" says Brian Boyd, president at Cover My Risk, Inc., an independent insurance agency.\n\nAlaina Hixson, director of sales and operations at The Churchill Agency, an independent agency offering auto insurance nationwide, also notes that extreme weather events and fraud have been underlying factors affecting rates.\n\nGet a free auto insurance price quote online today.\n\nHow to choose the best car insurance coverage for your needs\n\nHere are some steps to find the best auto insurance coverage for your particular situation:\n\nEvaluate your needs\n\nBefore searching for car insurance coverage, evaluate your needs. While nearly all drivers will need some level of liability insurance, it may be worth looking into collision coverage, comprehensive coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, and personal injury protection (PIP).\n\nIf you have an auto loan, gap insurance can be a smart investment, as it covers any gap between your car's current value and your remaining balance.\n\n\"It's the most important to carry a reasonable amount of liability, because if you hurt somebody else you can very easily be sued, you can cause injury and harm to someone else. So you want to be well protected,\" says Hixson.\n\nHowever, Parsons notes that if your car loan balance has been paid, collision protection is optional. This could result in savings, however, it's important to note you'd then be responsible for damages or replacing your vehicle in a car accident. Used vehicle prices are still elevated, so do your research and look at your cash reserves before dropping this coverage. Parsons recommends getting comprehensive coverage.\n\n\"It's the cheaper of the two between your collision and comprehensive. Comprehensive is usually nothing really your fault. So your car is parked, a tree branch falls on it, it's vandalized, it's broken into,\" says Parsons.\n\nEvaluating your specific needs based on your situation will help you find the best insurance. Boyd suggests avoiding accident forgiveness policies that cost more now and instead let insurers adjust rates if you get into an accident.\n\nCheck potential discounts\n\nTo help you secure cheap insurance, check out potential discounts from various insurance companies. One of the most significant is a bundling discount, where you have multiple insurance policies with one company. If you already have auto and home insurance, it could help to have them with the same insurer.\n\nAdditionally, signing up for paperless billing may be an easy way to score a car insurance discount.\n\n\"If you have young drivers, a lot of companies give a good student discount. Usually, you just need a B or better grade average, including college,\" says Parsons.\n\nSome car insurance companies may also offer driver training and student away discounts for young drivers. Parsons also recommends looking into discounts for taking an online defensive driving course.\n\nOther car insurance discounts include a good driver discount, vehicle safety and anti-theft discounts. You may also qualify for additional savings based on your profession or affiliation, such as being a teacher or in the military.\n\nReview financial strength ratings\n\nWhen you're shopping around for car insurance coverage, you want to find a company that can be a trusted partner and hold up their end of the bargain. If you need to file a claim, you want an insurance company that can help cover costs.\n\nThat's why it's a good idea to look at the AM Best Financial Strength Rating (FSR) for a company. AM Best is a third-party entity that evaluates a company's \"ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.\" Having a Superior (A+) or Excellent (A) rating is ideal.\n\nGet multiple auto insurance quotes\n\nThe key to finding cheap auto insurance is to compare car insurance quotes from multiple providers. If you review a minimum of four or five options, you'll have a good understanding of what rates you qualify for and which companies offer the lowest rates.\n\nWhile cost is important, the most affordable coverage may not be the best for your situation. Look at coverage types, potential discounts, deductible amounts and customer reviews. You can check out ratings on Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and review the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' complaint index.\n\nLook into telematics programs\n\nHixson recommends looking into telematics programs that base your rate on your specific driving habits. Some may be able to reward you for safer driving, while others, like pay-per-mile insurance or pay-as-you drive, can offer lower rates because you drive fewer miles.\n\nTypically, these programs look at your acceleration, braking, speed, and distance and you must download an app and use a monitoring device.\n\nChoose a higher deductible\n\nPaying more via a higher auto insurance deductible can help reduce your premiums. Be aware that your deductible is the portion that you're responsible for before any insurance benefits kick in. So, if you can afford to pay a higher deductible, you may be able to lower insurance costs.\n\nSelect an annual term\n\nTo help combat higher rates, select a 12-month annual policy instead of a six-month policy.\n\n\"If your company has a rate increase, they can't do it until your renewal. So if you only have an annual policy, then you're only going to get it once a year versus if you have a six-month policy, they could increase your rates twice, depending on how many times they increase rates,\" says Parsons.\n\nPay upfront\n\nIf it's financially feasible, you can save money on your car insurance by paying for your policy upfront instead of in monthly payments. Check to see if the insurance company offers a discount for paying in full. Before doing so, make sure you have an emergency fund and understand how this will impact your cash flow.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nFiguring out how to find cheap car insurance in today's climate is becoming more difficult. The best thing to do is to maintain a clean driving record and avoid all forms of distracted driving, such as using the phone or eating. Being a responsible borrower and making payments on time may also help.\n\n\"Do your best to create superior credit. While we do not pull credit, an insurance score is pulled that mirrors credit. This is not a factor in all 50 states, but most states will allow an insurance score to be part of the auto rate,\" says Boyd.\n\nWhile budget is a top priority for many people, you don't necessarily want to get the lowest coverage limits out there.\n\n\"I think you just can't take big risks with insurance. Try to cut your budget in other ways…You know you're going to kick yourself if you didn't have enough coverage,\" says Parsons.",

        "content": "Carl Dean, the husband of Dolly Parton of over 60 years, has died in Nashville, Tennessee, the singer announced on her social media on Monday.\n\n\"Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,\" Parton said in a statement. Dean was 82 years old.\n\nAccording to a statement provided to The Associated Press by Parton's publicist, Dean died on Monday and he will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending.\n\nThe couple met in 1964, when ran into each other outside the Wishy Washy Laundromat on the first day Parton had moved to Nashville. He swept her off her feet, as Parton later described it, and the couple married two years later.\n\n\"I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me). He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about,\" she said in an interview posted on her website to mark their 50th anniversary.\n\nDean was a businessman who ran an asphalt-laying company in Nashville until he retired. He remained largely out of the spotlight throughout the years as Parton rose to fame, and they were rarely pictured together in public. In 2011, Parton told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview that he had only come out to see her perform a handful of times because \"he gets nervous.\"\n\nIn 2016, Parton said she hadn't expected him to agree to a ceremony to renew their wedding vows.\n\n\"Well, he's shy about the public, in fact, I was surprised that he was willing to do this, but he's so proud too that we lasted 50 years,\" she said.\n\nParton and Dean never had any children together. Asked whether she regretted that, in a 2019 interview with CBS \"Sunday Morning,\" Parton replied, \"No, absolutely not. It wasn't meant to be. And I don't regret it. I never regretted it. I mean, it was a choice. So, you make your choices, you make your sacrifices, and I never looked back. I knew early on that I was gonna walk that road 'til God told me to stop. And I'm still walking it, and He ain't said nothing to me about quittin' yet!\"\n\nDean is survived by his siblings, Sandra and Donnie, Parton's statement said.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.\n\n\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"\n\nThe president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.\n\nThe anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.\n\n\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"\n\nSemiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.\n\n\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"\n\nThe vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.\n\n\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — The Supreme Court is considering Tuesday whether to block the Mexican government's effort to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for the havoc and violence the country has experienced at the hands of drug cartels armed with firearms trafficked across the southern border.\n\nThe legal battle marks the first time that the Supreme Court will consider a federal law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA. Enacted with bipartisan support from Congress in 2005, the law provides a legal shield for gun companies from civil suits seeking to hold them liable for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person.\n\nBut the case, known as Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, also lands before the high court as it has emerged as a bargaining tool in negotiations between President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. The Trump administration has designated Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups and imposed 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico. Sheinbaum warned last month that if the U.S. declared the cartels as terrorists, her government would expand its lawsuit against the American gunmakers.\n\nBetween 200,000 to 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's been called the \"iron river.\" Nearly half of all guns recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nMexico's lawsuit\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum attends the launch of a federal disarmament program outside the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City on Jan. 10, 2025. Daniel Cardenas/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nMexico, which has stringent firearms laws and a single gun store in the entire country, filed its lawsuit against seven of the nation's biggest gun manufacturers and one wholesaler in 2021. The country is seeking $10 billion in damages from the industry, as well as other forms of relief.\n\nA federal district court in Massachusetts dismissed the suit in September 2022, finding that PLCAA \"unequivocally\" bars lawsuits seeking to hold gunmakers responsible for the actions of people using their firearms. The court also found that while PLCAA contains narrow exceptions, none applied to its case.\n\nBut in January 2024, a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit reversed the district court's decision and revived Mexico's lawsuit.\n\nThe 1st Circuit found that Mexico's suit fell under one of PLCAA's exceptions, known as the predicate exception, which allows gun manufacturers or sellers to be sued if they knowingly broke the law, and if that violation led directly to Mexico's injuries. That determination pierced PLCAA's liability shield, allowing Mexico's suit to proceed.\n\nThe 1st Circuit found that the firearms manufacturers have been \"aiding and abetting\" the illegal sale of guns to traffickers for cartels in Mexico, and that the trafficking of firearms has foreseeably forced the Mexican government to incur significant costs as a result of increased threats and violence wrought by armed drug cartels.\n\nThe case remains in the early stages. While the gunmakers' appeal was pending, and before the Supreme Court agreed to step into the dispute, the district court dismissed six of the eight manufacturers from the case. The two remaining companies are Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms, a wholesaler.\n\nA key focus for the justices is likely to be the whether Mexico can draw a direct link from the manufacturers' lawful production of firearms to the illegal trafficking of those guns and crimes committed by armed cartels.\n\n\"It's where Mexico might be the most vulnerable because however you lay this out, there are certainly a number of intervening actors and things that have to occur before the firearms could actually be used to cause harm in the country of Mexico,\" said Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.\n\nLawyers for the gun companies, led by Smith & Wesson, argued that Mexico relies on an multi-step chain to tie the lawful production and sale of their guns within the U.S. to the chaos in Mexico incited by drug cartels criminally misusing their weapons. That chain starts with the federally licensed manufacturers, flows to wholesalers who sell to licensed dealers, who then engage in unlawful sales of guns that are trafficked into Mexico and land with the cartels. The final links are the guns being used to commit crimes that injure property and people, and the Mexican government being forced to spend money to respond to that fallout.\n\n\"In its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico seeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that safeguard the whole economy,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court brief. \"Indeed, [i]n Mexico's view, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good could face liability over the predictable criminal misuse of its products by downstream consumers. But that is not the law.\"\n\nThe industry's lawyers said Mexico's lawsuit rests on routine business practices and likened the gunmakers to Budweiser selling beer to a college-town bar that serves underage drinkers.\n\n\"When the manufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply puts its product in the general stream of commerce, the aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that business with broadly policing every bad actor who may pick up its products downstream,\" they wrote.\n\nBut lawyers for the Mexican government claim that the gun manufacturers deliberately sell large quantities of their products through so-called red-flag dealers, who are known to disproportionately sell guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. One such dealer sold more than 650 guns to straw purchasers who were recruited by a drug cartel, the Mexican government alleged in a filing.\n\nMexico claims the companies also design and market certain firearms to cater to cartels, like Colt's Super \"El Jefe\" pistol, a reference to the crime bosses, and the Emiliano Zapata 1911 pistol, which is engraved with the Mexican revolutionary's declaration that \"it is better to die standing than to live on your knees.\"\n\nCiting the killings of Mexican police and military by weapons trafficked across the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as its efforts to combat gun trafficking, the Mexican government said it has \"tried to stem this relentless tidal wave.\"\n\n\"But its after-the-fact efforts to find and recover guns from the cartels are small-scale remedies given [the gun manufacturers'] systemic conduct in getting the guns into the trafficker[s]' hands in the first instance,\" they wrote.\n\nThe impact of the Supreme Court's ruling\n\nThe Supreme Court is seen in Washington, D.C., on March 2, 2025. TIERNEY L CROSS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf the court sides with the gunmakers, the impact would depend on the contours of its opinion. Willinger said that the Supreme Court could issue a narrow decision that focuses on some of the unique aspects of the case: the cross-border context and fact that it was brought by a foreign government.\n\nA group of gun violence prevention organizations warned the Supreme Court that accepting the gun manufacturers' argument would have devastating consequences.\n\n\"It would be a signal that our law doesn't appropriately contemplate or even respect the suffering of victims of gun violence, the harm they suffered, the lives lost, the lives changed forever,\" said David Pucino, deputy chief counsel and legal director at Giffords Law Center. \"And it would further suggest an impunity for one particular industry in our country.\"\n\nGiffords is one of several gun violence prevention groups that submitted a friend-of-the-court brief backing Mexico in the case.\n\n\"They're trying to take the existing federal immunity statute and dramatically expand its reach because the statute was written and passed with an exception that prevents law-breakers from claiming immunity,\" he said. \"The restrictions do not apply when the plaintiffs can trace the harm they suffered to a violation of state or federal law.\"\n\nSome lawsuits brought against gun manufacturers in state courts have been successful at getting through PLCAA's liability shield — notably a historic $73 million settlement the families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting reached with Remington Arms, which made the rifle used in the massacre.\n\nAnd since 2021, at least nine states have enacted laws that authorize civil lawsuits against the gun industry.\n\nWillinger said that if Mexico prevails before the Supreme Court, it \"would be a stamp of approval for some of these state firearm nuisance laws and some of these efforts that have been happening at the state level to essentially make it easier to bring cases under the predicate exception.\"\n\nWhile the case does not involve the Second Amendment, it comes on the heels of a June 2022 Supreme Court decision that expanded gun rights. The high court is also considering the legality of a rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns, though that case involves whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms exceeded its authority.",

        "content": "Growing public outrage in Mexico as journalists are targeted and killed\n\nMexican authorities were investigating the killing of a local reporter Monday in the central state of Guanajuato, the country's homicide leader.\n\nThe state prosecutor's office identified the victim only by his first name, but local media outlets said the victim was Kristian Zavala, who covered local goings on in the city of Silao on his Facebook page. Zavala and another person were killed Sunday, according to the office. According local media, Zavala and his companion were shot dead by unknown individuals aboard a vehicle after midnight\n\nIt was at least the third killing of a media worker so far this year, though it remained unclear if the motive was connected to his work. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists and Mexico's chapter of Articulo 19 demanded a thorough investigation.\n\nViolence in Guanajuato is linked to ongoing conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in the Latin American nation. Last month, the Trump administration formally labeled eight cartels as terrorist groups, including the Jalisco cartel.\n\nFor years, Mexico has been one of the world's most dangerous countries outside a war zone for journalists. A record number of journalists were killed worldwide in 2024, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report released last month.\n\nHow journalist killings are counted\n\nSometimes authorities say the victim was a journalist, but usually only if it was someone well known. More commonly, press advocacy organizations share the information.\n\nThe information, however, can vary between sources. In many cases, like that of Zavala, the victims cover very local events using social platforms rather than for a traditional newspaper, television or radio station. In those cases, it's also common that the coverage is only one of the person's jobs. They may also drive a taxi or do something else to make ends meet.\n\nThe same authorities who are looked to for answers in some cases quickly dismiss a journalist's work as a possible motive or suggest they were involved with unseemly people or business.\n\nThe number of journalist killings is down, but does that mean it's safer?\n\nNo. Mexico had its deadliest year for journalists in 2022 with 13 killings, according to CPJ and Articulo 19. In 2023 and 2024, that fell to half or fewer, but non-lethal attacks shot up.\n\nIn 2023, Articulo 19 recorded 561 such attacks, which includes disappearances as well.\n\nHyperlocal journalists like Zavala are frequently the most exposed. They cover crime in places where cartels operate with impunity or cover local politics where justice is difficult to access and politicians may consider it easier to simply silence a critical voice.\n\nAll but a handful of media workers' killings and abductions remain unsolved.\n\n\"Impunity is the norm in crimes against the press,\" the the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report on Mexico last year.\n\nWhat do authorities do?\n\nPress advocates criticize authorities for frequently downplaying aggression toward the press and sometimes not investigating at all.\n\nDuring the administration of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, he used his daily press briefings frequently to attack journalists, calling them enemies or adversaries and leaving the impression they were fair game.\n\nA report by CPJ and Amnesty International showed in 2024 that Mexico fails in its efforts to provide state-sanctioned protection to members of the press.",

The sheriff's office also said there were no signs of blunt force trauma when their bodies were found.\n\nHow long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?\n\nHackman's pacemaker recorded its last event on Feb. 17, which was nine days before the bodies were found, Mendoza said Friday. The sheriff said it's possible that was Hackman's last day of life.\n\nA search warrant issued the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found says they showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet. Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nWhere were Hackman and Arakawa found?\n\nHackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.\n\nHackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.\n\nArakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.\n\nArakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says. A space heater was also seen near Arakawa's head.\n\nHackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead\n\nA German Shepherd was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog was in a kennel or crate.\n\nThe dog's cause of death also remains undetermined.\n\nThere were two dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.\n\nNo immediate signs of foul play\n\nDeputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.\n\nThere were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.\n\nNo signs of a carbon monoxide leak\n\nThere were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said. The Santa Fe City Fire personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company tested the scene for carbon monoxide and other foreign elements and did not find any, the sheriff's office said.\n\nCarbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.\n\nWhat movies was Gene Hackman in?\n\nHackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films.\n\nSome of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).\n\nHe won Academy Awards for best actor in a leading role in 1972 for his performance in \"The French Connection\" and best actor in a supporting role in 1993 for his role in \"Unforgiven.\"\n\nHackman retired from the screen in 2004.\n\nHe also wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels.\n\nWho was Betsy Arakawa?\n\nArakawa, who was raised in Honolulu, was a concert pianist and co-founder of a home furnishing business, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWhen she was 11, she performed at the Honolulu International Center Concert Hall and later in life, she played with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, the AP reported.\n\nArakawa and Hackman met while she was working part-time at a California fitness center in the 1980s, according to a New York Times article.\n\nArakawa helped found Pandora's, a home decor store in Santa Fe, in 2001, the AP reported.\n\nDoes Gene Hackman have any children?\n\nHackman had three children — two daughters and a son — with his first wife, Faye Maltese.\n\nHis daughters Elizabeth and Leslie and granddaughter Annie confirmed his death in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,\" they wrote.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Both sides stopped short of saying the ceasefire had ended.\n\nEgypt, who served as a key mediator with the militant group, condemned Israel's decision to stop aid, accusing it of using \"starvation as a weapon.\"\n\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Sunday called for the immediate implementation of the next phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.\n\nHundreds of aid trucks have entered Gaza daily since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, and it was unclear what the immediate impact of the aid cutoff would be.\n\nTrucks line up at the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip after Israel blocked the entry of aid trucks into Gaza, Sunday, March 2, 2025. Mohammed Arafat / AP\n\nThe first phase of the ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance for people in Gaza, expired on Saturday. The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, during which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining Israeli hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.\n\nNetanyahu said that under the existing agreements Israel could resume fighting after the first phase if it believed negotiations were ineffective. He said the ceasefire would only continue if Hamas kept releasing hostages, telling his Cabinet that \"there will be no free lunches.\" He said Israel was \"fully coordinated\" with President Trump's administration.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the United States on the proposal announced by Israel or its decision to cut off aid.\n\nAt the same time, Israeli warplanes intensified their activity over Gaza, carrying out airstrikes on areas in Khan Younis and Beit Hanoun, resulting in casualties, CBS News' team in Gaza reported. Reports indicate that these attacks killed at least two people and injured others, including women and children.\n\nBorder crossings into Gaza remain closed, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Israel said a new proposal, which it said came from U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, called for extending the ceasefire through Ramadan – the Muslim holy month that began over the weekend – and the Jewish Passover holiday, which ends on April 20.\n\nAs the sun sets, Palestinians sit at a large table surrounded by the rubble of destroyed homes and buildings as they gather for iftar, the fast-breaking meal, on the first day of Ramadan in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip,Saturday, March 1, 2025 Abdel Kareem Hana / AP\n\nUnder that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, according to Netanyahu's office.\n\nForeign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was prepared to negotiate over the next phase but insisted on more hostages being freed during the talks. He said Israel had received a side letter from the Biden administration saying there was no automatic transition between the phases of the truce.\n\n\"We fulfilled all our commitments (under Phase 1) until the very last day, which was yesterday,\" he told a press conference. \"Our position is that during negotiations, hostages should be released.\"\n\nHamas warned that any attempt to delay or cancel the ceasefire agreement would have \"humanitarian consequences\" for the hostages and reiterated that the only way to free them was through implementing the existing deal, which did not specify a timeline for freeing the remaining captives.\n\nHamas has said it is willing to free the hostages all at once in Phase 2, but only in return for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nAn Egyptian official said Hamas and Egypt would not accept a new proposal aimed at returning the remaining hostages without ending the war. The official noted that the agreement had called on the two sides to begin negotiations over Phase 2 in early February.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said mediators were trying to resolve the dispute.\n\nPeople take part in a protest demanding the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, March 1, 2025. Leo Correa / AP\n\nUnder the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces pulled back from most of Gaza and Israel allowed a surge of humanitarian aid to enter.\n\nIsrael imposed a complete siege on Gaza in the opening days of the war and only eased it later under U.S. pressure.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. The militants are currently holding 59 hostages, 32 of whom are believed to be dead, after releasing most of the rest in two ceasefire agreements.\n\nIsrael's offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It says more than half of those killed were women and children but does not specify how many of the dead were combatants.\n\nIsraeli bombardment and ground operations pounded large areas of the strip to rubble and at the height of the conflict displaced some 90% of the population of 2.3 million Palestinians. The war has left most of Gaza's population dependent on international aid for food and other essentials.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration has paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine, the White House confirmed Monday. It's the latest fallout days after a contentious meeting between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House erupted into an open dispute in front of TV cameras.\n\n\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"\n\nThe U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons for Ukraine as it continues to fend off Russian troops three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion three years ago. But Mr. Trump's return to office has brought a marked shift in U.S. policy toward the conflict, with the president blaming Ukraine for the war Russia started.\n\nFriday's meeting, which was meant to precede the signing of an economic and minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, devolved into a confrontation.\n\nMr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. The meeting abruptly ended without signing the rare earth minerals deal, and several White House officials told CBS News that the future of military aid for Ukraine was in doubt.\n\nSince Mr. Trump took office in January, $3.85 billion has been available in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, U.S. officials previously told CBS News. But the Trump administration has not packaged any of that aid for a single shipment since Jan. 21, a diplomatic source told CBS News Monday. Still, there have been shipments of weapons sent to Ukraine since Jan. 20 that were promised by the Biden administration in earlier drawdowns, according to defense officials.\n\nThe $3.85 billion is spending authority, not congressionally appropriated funds, which means it's up to the White House to determine whether to release the aid. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere.\n\nSeparately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. So far, the Trump State Department has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.\n\nAfter Friday's meeting, Zelenskyy traveled to London for a summit with European and Canadian leaders, where he stressed the importance of Western security guarantees as part of any agreement that would bring the war to an end. He said in Ukrainian that peace with Russia was \"still very, very far away,\" but he thought that Ukraine-U.S. relations would hold.\n\nMr. Trump later posted a link to an Associated Press story covering Zelenskyy's comments and wrote, \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\"\n\n\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\" Mr. Trump added.\n\nMr. Trump's hardened stance on Ukraine has rankled some GOP lawmakers.\n\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday, \"I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It's the Ukrainians who are shedding blood. It is Putin who launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on a free, democratic and sovereign country. And I am not backing off my support for Ukraine.\"\n\nBefore the Trump administration's announcement Monday, Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota who serves on the Armed Services Committee, said of Ukraine, \"I'll simply say that we've got to get back on track again.\"\n\n\"It's critical that we get a minerals agreement put together and that we work on getting a security agreement with Ukraine,\" Rounds told reporters at the Capitol. \"They have been attacked. Russia is in the wrong, but we want to find a pathway to peace, and that means somebody has got to be the intermediary. I don't know if the president wants to be that. We need to give him the opportunity, but Russia is the aggressor, and we have to recognize that.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Trump said last month that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has also directed Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.\n\n\n\nBut Rubio said in February there was \"a long ways to go\" before peace talks could begin.\n\nDelegations led by Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, shortly after those comments, without Ukrainian officials present. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said after the meeting that Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\"\n\n, , and contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "President Trump wants to dismantle the Department of Education. Here's what would be impacted.\n\nThe Senate voted Monday to confirm former wrestling executive Linda McMahon as the nation's education chief, a role that places her atop a department that President Trump has vilified and vowed to dismantle.\n\nMcMahon will face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Mr. Trump's agenda. Already the president has signed sweeping orders to rid America's schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon \"to put herself out of a job.\"\n\nThe Senate voted 51-45 to confirm McMahon. The vote was along party lines, with all Republicans present voting for her and all Democrats against, although there were a few senators not voting — Republican Sens. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia as well as Democratic Sens. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Peter Welch of Vermont.\n\nShortly after being confirmed on Monday night, McMahon sent a letter to the Department of Education with the subject line \"Our Department's Final Mission.\"\n\n\"The reality of our education system is stark, and the American people have elected President Trump to make significant changes in Washington,\" McMahon wrote. \"Our job is to respect the will of the American people and the President they elected, who has tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education — a momentous final mission — quickly and responsibly.\"\n\nMcMahon concluded the letter saying \"this is our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students. I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.\"\n\nA billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut's state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.\n\nLinda McMahon arrives to testify before a Senate committee on her nomination to be education secretary on Feb. 13, 2025. SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMcMahon's supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she's unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.\n\n\"Americans believe in public education,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said before the confirmation vote. \"They don't want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.\"\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Mr. Trump's blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department \"operate more efficiently,\" not to defund programs.\n\nShe acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.\n\nWeeks before McMahon's confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon's allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.\n\nCreated by Congress in 1979, the Education Department's primary role is to disburse money to the nation's schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.\n\nMr. Trump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America's schools.\n\nSchools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference \"diversity\" or \"equity\" alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to close the department and grant its authority to states. Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public school budgets.\n\nAlready, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department's work.\n\nTrump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \"woke\" and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation's academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.\n\nSome of the cuts have halted work that's ordered under federal law. At her hearing, McMahon said the agency will spend money that's directed by Congress, and she played down DOGE's cuts as merely an audit.\n\nMcMahon is a longtime Trump ally who left WWE in 2009 to launch a political career, running unsuccessfully twice for the U.S. Senate. She has given millions of dollars to Mr. Trump's campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.",

        "content": "Melbourne, Australia — An Australian man credited with saving 2.4 million babies through his record-breaking blood plasma donations over six decades, has died, his family said Tuesday. He was 88.\n\nJames Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.\n\nIn this May, 2011, photo provided by Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, donor James Harrison, credited with saving 2.4 million babies through his record-breaking blood plasma donations over six decades, is seen giving blood at donation center in Sydney. Australian Red Cross Lifeblood via AP\n\nHarrison's plasma contained a rare antibody known as anti-D. It's used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman's immune system attacks her fetus' red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh-negative blood type and her baby's is Rh-positive.\n\nAustralia has only 200 anti-D donors. They help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.\n\nDespite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, at the age of 81.\n\n\"He did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\" Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.\n\nThe record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.\n\nAustralian blood service pays tribute to James Harrison\n\nThe Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \"Man with the Golden Arm.\" That national agency, which is responsible for collecting and distributing blood products, is also known as Lifeblood.\n\nIts chief executive, Stephen Cornelissen, said Harrison had hoped that someone in Australia would one day beat his donation record.\n\n\"James was a remarkable, stoically kind and generous person who was committed to a lifetime of giving, and he captured the hearts of many people around the world,\" Cornelissen said in a statement.\n\n\"It was James' belief that his donations were no more important than any other donors' and that everyone can be special in the same way that he was,\" Cornelissen added.\n\nLifeblood said that, \"It's with enormous gratitude that we acknowledge the generous life of James Harrison. ... We thank James for the incredible contribution he made and the millions of lives he has saved.\"\n\nMellowship said his mother, Tracey Mellowship, Harrison's daughter, needed the treatment when he and his brother, Scott, were born.\n\nJarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.\n\nHow James Harrison's blood might have acquired its unique feature\n\nThere is speculation that Harrison developed high concentrations of anti-D as a result of his own blood transfusions during major lung surgery when he was 14.\n\n\"After the surgery, his dad, Reg, told grandad you're only really alive because people donated blood,\" Jarrod Mellowship said. \"The day he turned 18, he started donating.\"\n\nThe application of anti-D in fighting hemolytic disease of the newborn wasn't discovered until the 1960s.\n\nHarrison, who was born in New South Wales, is survived by his sister, Margaret Thrift, his daughter, two grandsons and four great-grandchildren.",

He had said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances and Florida orange juice.\n\n\"Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,\" the Reuters news agency quoted Trudeau as saying.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford told NBC News he was prepared to retaliate by ending shipments of nickel and the transmission of electricity to the U.S. from his province.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was expected to announce her response during a news conference in Mexico City Tuesday morning, that nation's economy ministry said.\n\nImpact on markets, consumers\n\nEconomists warn that the new tariffs could lead to higher prices for American consumers and a trade war among major U.S. trading partners.\n\nInvestors reacted negatively to Monday's news that the tariffs on Mexico and Canada would take effect as planned. Major U.S. indices fell roughly 2% on the day. Trade war fears sent markets falling in Asia and Europe, as well on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if there was room left for Canada and Mexico to arrive at a deal before the deadline.\n\n\"No room left for Mexico or for Canada, no,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"The tariffs, they're all set, they go into effect tomorrow.\"\n\nHe has wielded tariffs as an instrument to extract concessions from foreign governments and encourage manufacturing in the U.S.\n\n\"It's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form,\" he said at the White House Monday after announcing a $100 billion investment by a Taiwanese semiconductor company. \"And now we're using them.\"\n\nThe tariffs are in response to what Mr. Trump views as Mexico and Canada's irresponsible handling of the southern and northern borders, including fentanyl entering the United States. Both countries won last-minute delays on the tariffs in February after Sheinbaum and Trudeau vowed to do more to crack down on fentanyl and illegal border crossings.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "content": "Ukrainian newspaper accuses U.S. of switching to Russia's side in the war\n\nPresident Trump's advisers on Saturday morning were still uncertain how to salvage a mining deal with Ukraine, which had been intended as a key first step in a Trump strategy to eventually secure a ceasefire and peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhat began as a formal meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Friday — a confidence-building step in a path toward peace between Russia and Ukraine — devolved into a feud, with finger-pointing and accusations.\n\nThe president's closest advisers — stunned after the debacle in the Oval Office — huddled around the Cabinet Room's oblong table for lunch, sources familiar with the events told CBS News.\n\nVice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were joined by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as the group rehashed what had just transpired.\n\nThey shared disbelief over what one source characterized as Zelenskyy badgering the president. Another official said that, had Zelenskyy kept his disagreements behind closed doors, the blowup wouldn't have happened.\n\nDuring the contentious meeting, Mr. Trump and Vance took an aggressive and sometimes belittling tone with Zelenskyy after he expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement given that he had repeatedly violated ceasefire deals, including the Minsk agreements, leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn the hours after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House at the behest of Rubio and Waltz — with a joint press conference scrapped — there was discussion about whether the Ukrainian leader should fire whoever may have advised him on Friday's strategy. CBS News has reached out to Ukrainian officials for comment.\n\nSome of the Trump team's frustration targeted Zelenskyy's chief adviser, Andriy Yermak, whom they believed had undermined negotiations in recent days. Others said they weren't so sure it was an adviser problem.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Zelenskyy had clashed with his American counterpart. President Biden once hung up on Zelenskyy because of the Ukrainian president's perceived combativeness, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. The friction was kept private and officials insist the dispute was over policy — not basic facts like which country had started the war.\n\nIn recent days, there were signs the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal might not come to fruition. Neither side had signed preliminary paperwork that typically precedes an economic agreement of this scale.\n\nOn Friday morning, Graham, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Democratic Sens. Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, Mark Kelly of Arizona and others met privately with Zelenskyy at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. They recommended that Zelenskyy avoid being contentious, say thank you and sign the deal without changes, according to people in the room.\n\nDespite Vance's assertion during the White House spat that Zelenskyy hadn't said \"thank you\" for U.S. support, Kelly maintained that the Ukrainian leader was thankful for U.S. support — and said so during the meeting with senators.\n\n\"He has this like habitual gratitude,\" Kelly told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"He was very thankful, and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee kicked the cameras out of the room before we started to talk. That's the way this should be handled, not what — not what Donald Trump did.\"\n\n\"He was cornered and he was bullied in the Oval Office,\" Kelly continued, adding, \"I think Donald Trump was trying to look tough. JD Vance was trying to look tough. The only winner in that exchange is Putin.\" Kelly called the White House eruption \"a dumpster fire of diplomacy.\"\n\nSome Trump advisers were nervous the deal might go south before the ceremonial signing, but felt confident by the time Mr. Trump greeted Zelenskyy. They viewed it as an economic security guarantee, a shared investment binding the U.S. and Ukraine for a generation, sources said.\n\nZelenskyy had appealed to the West for ceasefire and post-war security guarantees, which were not explicitly included in the minerals deal. In Kyiv last month, Treasury Secretary Bessent had described the agreement as the foundation for a larger peace deal, and an economic partnership that would provide once the conflict is over a 'long term security shield for all Ukrainians.' However, the deal itself was not a ceasefire or peace agreement. Bessent described it as a very strong signal to Russian leadership of American commitment.\n\nKyiv had hoped for security guarantees up front that would secure a pledge by the U.S. to help keep the long term peace and prevent Russia from invading again.\n\nThe White House expected to finalize a version of the deal Friday that was essentially the same as one Bessent presented to Kyiv in mid-February. One modification: a provision was removed that would have placed a $500 billion cap on the value of minerals Ukraine would provide. The change was made at Ukraine's request because Zelenskyy disliked the narrative that Ukraine owed a certain repayment for past aid, people familiar with the deal said.\n\n\"We were trying to make it reasonable for them,\" one Trump adviser said. Trump's team privately discussed how they liked the new version better because it meant a deal could be worth more than initially conceived.\n\nThe minerals deal was a concept Graham had circulated as an avenue to create a new, mutually beneficial relationship for the two countries. Zelenskyy had presented it to Mr. Trump, at Graham's urging, at a meeting at Trump Tower in September.\n\nBut on Friday, staff quietly removed the formal ceremonial set-up from the East Room — a conference table and two podiums, and two sets of binders with unsigned documents.\n\nZelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London to meet with sympathetic European allies. No plans had been made for Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to speak again.\n\nIn the meantime, America remains the most significant military and financial backer of Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. There is $3.85 billion in military equipment already designated for delivery to Ukraine, and it is not clear if Mr. Trump will still clear it for delivery.\n\n\"They are fortunate it's not off already,\" a senior U.S. official told CBS News.\n\nAs for any further pledges of U.S. support from the Republican-led Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson recently said there's no appetite for it.",

        "content": "Actor Ione Skye, known for her breakout role in the 1989 film \"Say Anything,\" is giving fans a look behind her glamorous but tumultuous Hollywood life in a new memoir titled \"Say Everything.\"\n\nIn her memoir, the 54-year-old actress reflects on a journey that began when she was just 15, starring alongside Keanu Reeves in \"River's Edge\" before sharing the screen with River Phoenix, Matthew Perry and John Cusack in the films that would cement her status as a teen idol.\n\n\"When I look back on the pictures, I almost can't take in how young I look,\" Skye said.\n\nThe memoir also details her relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis, which began when she was 16 and he was 24.\n\n\"I liked the idea of this dangerous dark prince of a rock n' roller,\" she writes, though her perspective has shifted with time.\n\n\"It shocks me. And I also feel bad for myself,\" Skye said. \"I'm happy I knew Anthony Kiedis and [Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist] Flea, but I wish I'd met them ten years later and never dated them.\"\n\nKiedis struggled with heroin addiction during their relationship. When asked why she stayed, Skye said: \"I thought I had to save him.\"\n\nThe actress later married Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys at age 21, a relationship that lasted seven years before ending due to affairs Skye had with women. The end of this relationship in particular, Skye said, is difficult to look back on – even more than 25 years later.\n\n\"I discovered writing this book, it was very clear that I'm not good with grief. I'm not good with loss at all,\" she said. \"I still find it painful. I can't even listen to a Beastie Boys song. It feels like a death to me.\"\n\nShe said she feels the pain comes from not only hurting a \"sweet person\" but also hurting herself.\n\nMuch of Skye's memoir explores how her relationships were shaped by the absence of her father, Scottish singer Donovan Leitch, who left when she was born.\n\n\"Hearing his beautiful music was very painful sometimes because it's hard to see someone do beautiful art and think, 'Where is that for me?,\" she said.\n\nThe book reveals a disturbing chapter when Leitch's attorney sent a letter requesting a paternity test when Skye was already a successful actress.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" she said.\n\nUltimately, Skye decided against taking the paternity test. Skye says she didn't meet her father until just before her 18th birthday.\n\n\"It was strange. I was really self-conscious in thinking we're touching right now for the first time and hugging,\" she recalled. \"The sad thing is I wanted more. Yeah, I just, and I still do. I wanted to just see him again.\"\n\nSkye would have another revelation when she was pregnant and splitting up with her fiancé, designer David Netto.\n\n\"I was in the shower, pregnant and sobbing because it was so stressful. And then I thought my mother probably was pregnant with me in a shower in 1969,\" she said. \"That's a very direct repeat of a pattern.\"\n\nNow living in Australia with her husband, musician Ben Lee, and their family, Skye says they share the same unique experience of early fame.\n\n\"Our careers were really big when we were teenagers and we've both had to deal with the ups and downs of keeping our careers going,\" she said.\n\nFive years ago, Skye took her family to visit her father and stepmother in Ireland, a trip she describes as healing. She also found connection with her father through her role in the film \"Zodiac,\" which featured one of his songs.\n\nReflecting on completing her memoir, Skye called it \"an act of self-forgiveness.\"\n\n\"I felt very proud. I felt like I learned a lot about myself,\" she said. \"I felt like it's a bit of whiplash for a long time, but I do settle in a nice place.\"",

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nThere are a few simple steps you can take to lower the cost of your car insurance. Getty Images\n\nCar insurance rates are climbing, leaving many Americans struggling to keep up with the cost of coverage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), auto insurance prices surged 11.3% year-over-year from December 2023 to December 2024.\n\nSeveral factors help contribute to the rising price of car insurance, like higher repair costs and more expensive medical claims, which can make it tough to control your car insurance costs, even if you're a safe, incident-free driver. But while you can't control insurance industry pricing trends, you can take steps to lower your premiums.\n\nCompare auto insurance policies to find the most affordable options for you.\n\nWant cheaper car insurance? Review this checklist.\n\nIf you're looking to pay less for your car insurance, here are six smart ways to make it happen.\n\n1. Compare rates from multiple insurers\n\nInsurance companies calculate premiums using their own internal risk assessment processes, which means rates can vary significantly from one provider to another, even for the same coverage.\n\n\"The quickest way to get cheaper car insurance is to shop around and let your current insurer know you're shopping around,\" says Miranda Marquit, MBA, an insurance agent and financial wellness advocate. \"Compare rates to see if you can get a lower one elsewhere or if your current insurer will match a lower rate.\"\n\nThe Insurance Information Institute (III) recommends getting policy quotes from at least three insurance providers. That way, you have a good chance of finding the best coverage at the most affordable price.\n\nFind out how much you could save with the right car insurance coverage.\n\n2. Raise your deductible\n\nAnother quick way to lower your monthly insurance costs is to raise your deductible — the amount you must pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in for the remainder of your claim.\n\nThe III reports that raising your deductible from $200 to $500 may lower your annual premium by 15% to 30% while increasing it to $1,000 could save you up to 40%. Ask your provider how much raising your deductible would lower your rates. It may be worth considering if the difference is significant, but only if you can comfortably cover the out-of-pocket repair cost if you need to file a claim.\n\n\"Raising deductibles to $1,000, $2,500 or $5,000 can lower the cost of insurance, but be sure that you have enough in savings to comfortably pay the deductible. If coming up with the funds to cover a high deductible would be difficult, then you will have to pay the higher premium for lower deductibles,\" Kress Staheli, a Farmers Insurance agent, says.\n\n3. Take advantage of discounts\n\nMost insurers offer various discounts, but you may not be aware of them. Some of the most common car insurance discounts include:\n\nMaintaining a good driving record\n\nBundling more than one policy\n\nDriving fewer than the average number of miles per year\n\nBeing a student with a high grade point average\n\nHaving a car with an anti-theft device or premier safety features\n\nTalk with your insurance agent to review your policy and explore potential discounts. You may be eligible for more savings than you realize.\n\n\"My agency offers an annual review for policyholders, and often during those reviews, insureds find additional, lesser known, discounts for things like occupation, payment method, policy delivery method, use of an app to track safe driving or discounts for adding additional policies,\" says Staheli.\n\n4. Improve your credit score\n\nMany states allow insurers to consider your credit information when setting your policy premiums.\n\n\"The thinking is that if you have good credit, you're likely to be more careful in other areas of your life, including driving, so you're likely to be less of a claim risk,\" says Marquit.\n\nIf your credit has improved since you opened your policy, ask your insurer for a rate review to see if you qualify for a lower rate. If not, it may be worth shopping other providers to compare quotes and find a better deal.\n\n5. Drop comprehensive and collision coverage\n\nIf you're financing your vehicle, lenders and leasing companies typically require full coverage auto insurance, which includes comprehensive and collision coverage. Comprehensive and collision coverage helps to pay for repairs or replacement if your car is stolen, damaged by fire, vandalism, or severe weather (comprehensive) or involved in an accident (collision). If you own your car outright, you might consider dropping these coverages and keeping only liability insurance instead, which could help you save a substantial amount.\n\nNote, though, that without this coverage, any repair or replacement costs related to your vehicle will not be covered if you're at fault in an accident or your car is stolen or damaged. A general guideline is that it could make sense to drop comprehensive and collision coverage if your car's value is less than 10 times your annual premium. Keep in mind, however, that before you drop this coverage, you should make sure you can afford to cover these types of costs for your own vehicle if you need to file a claim.\n\n6. Consider switching to a pay-per-mile policy\n\nIf you drive fewer than 10,000 miles per year, a pay-per-mile insurance plan could offer significant savings compared to standard insurance policies. This type of policy, which is different from a policy with a low-mileage discount, charges a base rate plus a per-mile fee. A pay-per-mile plan can be a wise choice if you work from home or simply don't drive much, as it bases your premium on actual mileage rather than a flat rate.\n\nBear in mind that not all insurers offer pay-per-mile plans, and those that do may not provide them in every state. Coverage may also be limited to vehicles within a specific age range.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nCar insurance rates aren't likely to fall anytime soon, but you can still save money by shopping and comparing quotes, raising your deductible, taking advantage of discounts and following other proven strategies.\n\nIf it's been a while since you've reviewed your auto insurance policy, contact your agent now or get quotes from other providers to see how much you might save. Even a slight rate reduction could add up to hundreds of dollars in annual savings.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "What we know about the measles death reported in Texas\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted vaccine skeptic, voiced support for the measles vaccine Sunday amid a deadly outbreak in the Southwest, mainly in Texas.\n\nAn unvaccinated child who died in late February in Texas was the first U.S. fatality from the highly contagious disease in a decade.\n\nRecently confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy has previously made numerous false and misleading claims about the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and had downplayed the growing outbreak, saying annual outbreaks were \"not unusual.\"\n\nBut on Sunday, Kennedy said he was \"deeply concerned about the recent measles outbreak,\" in an opinion piece published by Fox News.\n\n\"Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,\" he wrote.\n\nHowever, he said, \"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" and he urged all parents to \"consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine.\"\n\nHe said he had directed federal health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to provide support to Texas health authorities.\n\nThe CDC and other health agencies have faced staffing cuts in recent weeks as part of President Trump's sweeping overhaul of the federal government.\n\nKennedy said health workers, officials and communities were responsible for \"ensuring that accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy is disseminated\" and making \"vaccines readily accessible for all those who want them.\"\n\nKennedy has dismissed critics who say he is anti-vaccine, claiming his views were mischaracterized and insisting he was advocating for \"common sense\" policies.\n\nKennedy wrote in the piece, \"The current Texas outbreak has predominantly affected children, with 116 of the 146 cases occurring in individuals under 18 years of age. The DSHS reports that 79 of the confirmed cases involved individuals who had not received the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, while 62 cases had unknown vaccine status. At least five had received an MMR vaccine.\"\n\nDr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said recently on \"CBS Mornings\" that even a slight dip in vaccination coverage can lead to outbreaks.\n\n\"This is a measles outbreak that began in a very close-knit, rural, Mennonite community that has very low vaccination rates. And unfortunately, we have seen vaccination rates exemptions ... really soar in Texas in recent years,\" she said.\n\nLast month, Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins, told CBS News the outbreak in Texas was \"troubling, because this was completely preventable.\"\n\nHe pointed out that Texas \"has the lowest vaccination rates, the highest school exemption rates from measles vaccination — having a measles outbreak, including hospitalizations of individuals who've been infected with measles.\" Adalja said it should act as a reminder that measles is still a risk when proper precautions aren't taken.\n\nWhile measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, outbreaks continue to erupt each year.\n\nVaccination against the respiratory virus is very good at conferring lifetime immunity, with two doses estimated to be 97% effective, according to the CDC.",

        "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating after several airliners on approach to land at Washington Reagan National Airport Saturday morning received what appear to be false alarms from their onboard Traffic Collision Avoidance System.\n\n\"It's been happening all morning. Let me know if you see anything. No one else has seen anything except for on the TCAS,\" one air traffic controller can be heard telling an inbound flight. Based on CBS News' review of the ATC audio, at least 12 flight crews reported receiving apparent false TCAS alerts — leading three flights to perform go-arounds between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. ET on Saturday.\n\nCBS News heard no issues in the 8 a.m. hour. Then, six incidents occurred within 11 minutes of each other after 9 a.m. Saturday.\n\nThe pilots of American Eagle flight 4469, operated by Republic Airways, were coming into land from Pittsburgh when they received an alert. The flight was descending between 1200 and 1000 feet when TCAS instructed the pilots to take evasive maneuvers to avoid another object.\n\n\"We had to dive a little bit,\" one of the pilots told air traffic controllers.\n\nControllers asked the pilots after safely landing, \"did you actually visibly see anything other than what the TCAS was showing?\"\n\n\"Negative, it would just say an unknown target descending rapidly,\" the pilots responded.\n\n\"Alright, that's the same sort of reports we've been getting. It seemed like it had stopped but it sounds like it's starting again,\" a controller replied.\n\nThe FAA said in a statement to CBS News that several flight crews inbound to Reagan National Airport reported the onboard alerts when no other aircraft were nearby, but the total number of aircraft impacted is unclear.\n\n\"Some of the crews executed go-arounds as a result of the alerts. The FAA is investigating why the alerts occurred,\" the FAA's statement said. Federal investigators on Monday added that the issue has not been reported again since Saturday morning.\n\nFormer chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and CBS News transportation safety analyst Robert Sumwalt said that the situation is unusual.\n\n\"I've never heard of something like this,\" the retired 737 captain said. \"Nuisance alerts, yes, they happen. But not like this where several planes have it at the same location.\"\n\nThe TCAS is a piece of technology installed on individual planes, not a ground-based or centrally located system. It works by using an aircraft's transponder to detect and communicate with nearby aircraft. After receiving the position and altitude of the nearby aircraft, the system calculates if there's a potential for collision. If it finds there's a potential, it will instruct the pilots via audible alerts and displayed instructions to watch for traffic, climb or descend to avoid a mid-air collision.\n\n\"Yeah, we got a little something there,\" the pilots of American Eagle flight 4538, also operated by Republic, from New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport said after they received a similar alarm on Saturday morning. \"It said on the TCAS, it was 600 feet above us and we didn't see anything.\"\n\nAmerican Eagle flight 5197 arriving from Minneapolis reported the same thing occurring on their approach: \"We got a TCAS but we didn't see anything either.\"\n\nArriving from Des Moines, American Eagle 5098 reported receiving two warnings.\n\nDelta flight 5802 from Nashville told controllers after an alert, \"we saw nothing out there though.\"\n\nThe crew of Flight 4469 appeared to joke about a possible explanation, saying it was \"aliens.\" Another voice said \"Russia.\"\n\nThe incidents unfolded amid heightened scrutiny at Reagan National Airport after January's deadly crash between a Black Hawk and a regional aircraft. Last month, the NTSB recovered the plane's TCAS and investigators are working to examine the system and related components.",

And the unusual spectacle was all caught on video.\n\nThe pod of Bigg's killer whales visited Elliott Bay and were seemingly on a hunt underwater just off Seattle's maritime industrial docks. The pod exited the bay close to the West Seattle neighborhood across from downtown, where people were waiting to catch sight of them.\n\nKersti Muul, who runs a WhatsApp whale alert system for the Seattle area called \"Salish Wildlife Watch,\" recorded footage as the whales appeared just below a lookout point.\n\nA killer whale swims next to a grebe in the waters just off Seattle on Sunday, March 3, 2025, moments before the bird was taken under water. Kersti Muul / AP\n\nOne of the whales was seen grabbing a bird — a grebe — before pulling it underwater, prompting gasps from the crowd, CBS affiliate KIRO-TV reported.\n\nOne of the whales was seen capturing a bird and taking it below water, sparking gasps from onlookers.\n\nIt was \"a once-in-a-lifetime experience for West Seattle. Not only in the whales' proximity, but also witnessing a rarely seen behavior - chasing and catching the grebe,\" Muul said in a text. \"My eyes darted back and forth taking in the community's reactions and the orcas right below our feet, visible underwater.\"\n\nBigg's killer whales are orcas that usually prey on marine mammals such as sea lions or porpoises. According to NOAA, Bigg's killer whales depart from the behaviors of other orcas that are traditionally part of either \"resident\" or offshore populations.\n\nThey visit the waters off Seattle occasionally and both dedicated and casual whale watchers shadow them as they explore. The pod sighted Sunday has ventured into the Seattle waters several times over the past month.\n\n\"It's definitely a bonding experience for the community,\" Muul said. \"And my hope is always that these moments inspire awe and awareness of the urban wildlife in our backyards.\"\n\nPeople watch a killer whale swim close shore in the waters off Seattle on Sunday, March 3, 2025. Jeff Hogan via AP\n\nIn recent years, boaters in Europe have reported several instances of orcas ramming into their vessels in a pattern that baffled many marine experts. Sailors said they resorted to everything from throwing sand in the water to setting off fireworks to blasting thrash metal music in efforts to ward off the encroaching predators.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nOpting for full coverage car insurance can be a smart move, but it also has its downsides to consider, too. Getty Images\n\nAs car prices are rising, so too are the cost of insuring them. Higher costs for replacement parts and vehicle repairs are a primary driver of increasing premiums. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), insurance prices were 11.3% higher in December than the year prior, and if you live in certain states, your premiums could be as much as 50% steeper, leading to substantially higher insurance costs. As a result, many Americans are searching for ways to save on their auto insurance costs.\n\nOne way to do that might be to drop certain coverages from your policy. If you finance your vehicle, your lender or leasing company likely requires you to carry full coverage, which includes comprehensive, collision and liability coverage. However, if you own your car outright, you may be able to drop comprehensive and collision coverage and keep only liability insurance, which most states mandate.\n\nStill, many drivers opt to keep extra protection. Removing comprehensive and collision insurance coverage from your policy could provide substantial savings, but is that even an option? Is it necessary to keep full coverage car insurance? Let's take a closer look.\n\nFind out how to save more on your car insurance policy today.\n\nPros of full coverage car insurance\n\nEven if removing some of your full coverage policy saves you a pretty penny, you may opt to keep it for the key benefits it provides, such as:\n\nFull coverage offers more protection\n\nLiability-only insurance is certainly a more affordable option, but if you're at fault for a car accident, you could be on the hook to pay for costly damages and medical bills. On the other hand, your insurer is much more likely to cover repair or replacement costs for your car if you carry full coverage protection.\n\n\"Car crashes are always unexpected, and even for cautious and experienced drivers, an incident could occur that results in the need to file a claim,\" says Kress Staheli, a Farmers Insurance agent. \"Cars and trucks these days are built with high-tech features that cause them to be expensive, so the biggest benefit is that the insurance carrier will pay for the physical damage to your vehicle, and the full cost of the incident (you still pay a deductible) will not come out of your wallet.\n\nCompare your car insurance options and find the right coverage now.\n\nFull coverage provides more reassurance\n\nDriving without comprehensive and collision insurance exposes you to more financial risk in the event of an accident. On the other hand, carrying full coverage may offer you peace of mind knowing that if your car is damaged, your insurance will likely cover most of the expenses, minus the deductible.\n\nCons of full coverage car insurance\n\nEven though full coverage offers extra protection, it comes at a cost that might not always be worth it. Here are some potential downsides to consider:\n\nFull coverage is more costly\n\nThere's a price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with full coverage auto insurance, and it can be significantly higher than a liability-only policy.\n\n\"Full coverage can cost anywhere between two to three times the cost of your state's minimum liability requirement,\" Miranda Marquit, an insurance agent and financial wellness advocate, notes.\n\nFull coverage may not cover everything\n\nDon't assume that a full coverage policy covers every expense that could arise from an accident or claim. Policy details vary from one insurance provider to another, so it's important to review your coverage carefully for any gaps. For example, your insurer may not cover medical bills or lost wages if you're involved in a car accident.\n\nShould you keep or drop full coverage car insurance?\n\nIf you finance your vehicle, your lender or leasing company likely requires you to carry full coverage insurance. But if you own your car free and clear, exploring whether or not full coverage car insurance is necessary can help you decide if the extra protection is worth the added cost.\n\n\"For the most part, whether it's worth it to pay for comprehensive and collision depends on the value of your car,\" says Marquit. \"Compare how much you're paying for insurance compared to the replacement value of your car. Consider the deductible as well. For example, if your car is worth $3,000 and your deductible is $1,000, you'd only get $2,000 when it comes to your coverage. You might be paying more in that in insurance each year.\"\n\n\"A good rule of thumb is to drop comprehensive and collision coverage when the car is around ten years old, but everyone's financial situation and comfort level is different, so do what you feel is best. After all, insurance is about security and peace of mind,\" Staheli says.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nDeciding what coverages to include in your policy depends on your needs, especially when it comes to full coverage car insurance. So, review your auto insurance policy regularly to make sure your coverage aligns with your needs and remove coverages you no longer need. Carrying minimum liability coverage isn't the only way to save money on your car insurance, either. You can also raise your deductible, improve your credit score or take advantage of discounts from your insurer. Or, perhaps the simplest way to lower your costs is to shop and compare multiple insurance providers to secure the best rate for the coverage you want.",

        "content": "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts — genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.\n\nWoolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.\n\nColossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.\n\nColossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.\n\nIn this Feb. 2025 photo provided by Colossal Biosciences are genetically edited mice with long, thick, woolly hair at a lab in Dallas, Texas. AP\n\nIn a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"\n\nOutside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.\n\n\"You're not actually resurrecting anything — you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.\n\nOn Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"\n\nResults were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.\n\nThe feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.\n\nScientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.\n\nThe Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"\n\nThey picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance - a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.\n\nIndependent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"\n\nColossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.\n\nHowever, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.\n\n\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.\n\nIndependent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"\n\n\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.\n\nIn this Feb. 2025 photo provided by Colossal Biosciences a genetically edited mouse with long, thick, woolly hair at a lab in Dallas, Texas. AP\n\nStill, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.\n\nTelugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.\n\nThe same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.\n\n\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.\n\nBen Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.\n\n\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "President Trump's speech Tuesday night will take place in front of members of both Houses of Congress and the entire presidential line of succession — with one notable exception. Each year, one Cabinet member is chosen as the \"designated survivor\" who will sit out the speech in case of a catastrophic event.\n\nThe name of the designated survivor is not usually revealed to the public until shortly before the speech starts — or even sometimes after it starts.\n\nWhat is a designated survivor?\n\nThe designated survivor is the informal name used for the person in the line of succession who does not attend the joint session of Congress so that there would be a leader available to step up in case of a catastrophic event.\n\nThe line of succession was first determined by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, but the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 set the modern line of succession if something should happen to the president and he or she cannot undertake his or her duties. First in line for the presidency is Vice President JD Vance. Second in line after the vice president is House Speaker Mike Johnson, third in line is Senate pro tempore Chuck Grassley, fourth in line is Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and fifth in line is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The line continues through other members of the Cabinet, in the order their departments were created, with the secretary of Homeland Security — currently Kristi Noem — at 18th in line.\n\nSince all of those people would normally be in attendance at the joint session of Congress, a designated survivor is chosen to stay away.\n\nWhy does the practice of choosing a designated survivor exist?\n\nUnlike the line of succession, the designated survivor is not something determined by the Constitution. The practice is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, but it was not until 1981 that the first official designated survivor was named as then-Education Secretary Terrel Bell.\n\nHow do they choose the designated survivor?\n\nIt's not clear how the administration chooses a designated survivor since the process is classified. The person must be eligible to serve as president, so they must be a native-born American citizen and at least 35 years old. There have been several Cabinet members over the years who did not fit those criteria, including former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright, who was born in what is now the Czech Republic, and German-born Henry Kissinger.\n\nFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who was named as designated survivor by President Bill Clinton in 1996, told ABC News in 2014 that she was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff \"talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.\"\n\nWhat does the designated survivor do during the speech?\n\nThere have been a few designated survivors who have been willing to discuss what they did during the speech. Then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was tapped by Clinton to be designated survivor in 2000, told ABC News in 2014 that he watched the speech from a friend's house in Sherwood, Maryland, about 90 miles outside Washington.\n\n\"It's fun. You're sitting there, you're being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills,\" he told ABC News. \"My wife and my friends were impressed the fire trucks were there.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman wrote an essay in 2017 in Politico about his own experience after being chosen. According to Glickman, he was taken a secure location outside Washington (in his case, his daughter's New York apartment), where he writes that he was \"accompanied by key military staff and Secret Service, including a military officer carrying what I presumed to be the nuclear football — a black, leather-encased aluminum briefcase that would be used to authenticate the person ordering a nuclear strike.\"\n\n\"I don't recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened,\" Glickman wrote. \"All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.\"\n\nShalala, meanwhile, told ABC News that she stayed in Washington, waited it out at the White House and ordered pizza for her staff\n\n\"I saw the president when he left and when he came back,\" Shalala said. \"He said, 'Don't do anything I wouldn't do.'\"\n\nWho has been named designated survivor in the past?\n\nThe designated survivor is usually a member of the Cabinet, although the Secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury have never been chosen. There was no no designated survivor in 2021, since only 200 members of Congress attended the joint session of Congress amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHere are the last few designated survivors and the positions they held at the time:\n\n2024: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona\n\n2023: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh\n\n2022: Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo\n\n2021: No one\n\n2020: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt\n\n2019: Energy Secretary Rick Perry",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nPausing military aid is the most damaging move the Trump administration can make to Ukraine’s war effort, and however opaque the immediate practical consequence may be, the psychological impact for Ukrainians has been immense and catastrophic.\n\nThe last time US military aid was held up – by Trump-leaning Republicans in December 2023, when $60 billion was stalled for several months – the damage to morale was seismic. And after that delay, the momentum on the front lines changed from Ukraine pursuing a mostly unsuccessful counteroffensive, to being largely in defense.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Kyiv was still reeling from the hammer blow, and trying to suggest the impact might not be catastrophic. An adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, posted: “First, it is necessary to assess which specific programs will cease to function, considering that many were already in their final stages.”\n\nUkraine’s stocks of critical artillery shells could run out by May or June following the pause, a Ukrainian official told CNN on Tuesday. The official said that the first ammunition crisis following the US military aid pause would involve Patriot air defense missiles, which could run out in a matter of weeks.\n\n“We will adapt, but the question is how many additional people, and how much more territory, we lose while we do,” the official said.\n\nReactions from frontline troops noted the heavy role drones, or UAVs, play in holding back Russian assaults, but also the vital need for American-supplied air-defense missiles.\n\n“Our weakness is in air-defense missiles – the Patriots,” said Yegor Firsov, the chief sergeant of a UAV strike platoon. “Even we, the military, would like to have our families, our rear, protected as much as possible when we are serving on the frontline. Eighty per cent of all destruction, from a tank to an enemy dugout, is carried out directly by drones. So, of course, we have a chance to survive together with Europe.”\n\nUkrainian servicemen fire a M777 howitzer at Russian positions near Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine, in 2023. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSerhii Filimonov, commander of the 108th Separate Mechanized Battalion, or “Da Vinci Wolves,” which has been fighting outside the strategic town of Pokrovsk for nine months, said: “American support is critical for defending the sky, and financial assistance affects the economy and morale of society, which is also important for the frontline.”\n\nA Ukrainian source told CNN the decision did not impact intelligence sharing, which is a lower-cost but impactful component of US support to Kyiv’s war effort. Yet the nature of President Donald Trump’s move – however it plays out in practical terms – throws a focus on his rift with Zelensky and what must be done to heal it.\n\nTrump officials have hinted at the need for a public apology. It is clear they are also reluctant to present the proposed deal giving the United States access to Ukraine’s mineral riches for signature, although Trump did hint Monday that that agreement might see progress in the coming days. The Trump administration has also said Zelensky needs to commit to peace, yet not specified in any great detail what this peace would look like.\n\nWashington has laid out a vision of peace that appears a little binary – a moment in which the war stops and Moscow agrees to Trump’s solution unequivocally. Trump has said repeatedly he does not believe President Vladimir Putin will violate any deal they forge together.\n\nHis European allies disagree, and insist any peace deal is made with enough security guarantees for Ukraine that it can fend off any renewed Russian aggression. Ukrainian officials highlight, with evidence on their side, that Russia has violated more than 20 ceasefires or deals in the past decade.\n\nRescuers clean rubble at a damaged residential building after a Russian drone attack in Sumy. Kateryna Anokhina/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images\n\nThe peace Trump wants appears to require Zelensky to demand no further US support; rely on European allies possibly functioning without American assistance; sign up to a deal which provides Washington with an unspecified stream of cash from Ukraine’s natural resources to repay the US for aid, as well as invest in reconstruction; and then finally accede to whatever peace deal terms and conditions Trump agrees with Moscow, possibly without Ukraine at the table.\n\nThat is a big ask of a wartime leader. It demands of Zelensky that he unconditionally trust that the US president is acting in Ukraine’s interests. A public apology to Trump would go some distance, perhaps, in resolving the horrific collapse in Kyiv and Washington’s alliance. Yet it could have a fundamental impact on some Ukrainian morale: troops would see their commander in chief, in their eyes, apologizing for being bullied. It would say to Ukraine’s European allies that Kyiv has put Trump entirely in the driving seat, unclear on the destination he has in mind.\n\nUkraine has reason to distrust: The Budapest Memorandum of 1994 saw Kyiv surrender its nuclear weapons for security guarantees from the US, United Kingdom and Russia. Ukrainians have since endured a decade of Russian aggression, starting with its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. If even these explicit security guarantees changed nothing, why sign away the country’s mineral wealth if that comes without any specific promise to continue military aid?\n\nZelensky’s fate has become an occasional Trump talking point, and his future as a US partner hinges on his “acceptance of peace.” The peace Zelensky, and his European backers, seek is one where Ukraine is adequately armed and protected so that any renewed Russian assault – after months of re-fit and replenishment during a ceasefire renders Moscow’s war machine potent again – can be repelled.\n\nZelensky and Europe appear guided in their approach by the lessons of the 1930s. Trump appears guided by his belief that his personal relationships and deal-making acumen can disruptively win out over the brutal realities of war and geopolitics.\n\nUkraine’s president has a fateful choice ahead of him: accede to your erstwhile ally’s demand, and say you are sorry, while handing over your nation’s wealth, and assenting to undefined terms of a peace deal discussed without you. It places Ukraine in the most unfavorable position imaginable, after three years of savage Russian assault.\n\nThe payback is that, if Trump agrees, the US might continue to provide Ukraine with the vital third to a fifth of all military assistance they have in the past received. Laid out bare, is this a choice at all?\n\nCNN’s Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday will address Congress for the first time in his second term, and he’ll do so with an economy that is mostly chugging along.\n\nHowever, recent data has contained some warning signals that momentum could be slipping at a time when the Trump administration is conducting sweeping — and potentially economy-shifting — policy changes.\n\nHere’s a look at how some key economic indicators are faring:\n\nThe mighty US consumer, shored up by a strong labor market, helped drive steady economic growth throughout 2024. The US entered 2025 on solid enough footing that economists say it could weather some volatility.\n\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2024, real gross domestic product (GDP) — the broadest measure of economic output — grew 2.3%.\n\nStill, some bumpy times could be coming sooner than later, according to a closely watched predictor of real GDP growth.\n\nLast week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s real-time GDP forecast projected the economy could contract by 2.8%. The negative swing doesn’t necessarily signal a recession: It largely reflects a sharper-than-expected pullback in post-holiday consumer spending and a larger inflow of imported goods in advance of tariffs.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much further consumers could pull back. Recent sentiment surveys have shown Americans have grown increasingly sour about economic prospects.\n\nInflation has cooled dramatically since hitting a 40-year high in the summer of 2022; however, the path back to normal has been slow and bumpy. In January, two key inflation gauges (the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index) ran hot, driven higher by fast-rising food and energy prices.\n\nConcern also have heightened in recent weeks about how Trump administration policies, specifically the implementation of steep import tariffs, could raise prices for consumers and businesses as well as reaccelerate inflation.\n\nStill, as it stands now, the underlying data and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge do provide some silver linings and show that the current path still leads to disinflation. The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose at an annual rate of 2.5%, half of a percentage point above the Fed’s 2% target rate.\n\nBut while prices may not be rising as fast as they did in recent years, the cumulative effect of high inflation has weighed heavily on Americans, especially those who have little wiggle room in their monthly budgets.\n\nFed up with high prices, many voters brought their frustrations to the ballot box in November in hopes that a change of administration would bring some relief.\n\nThat hasn’t happened yet (the recent, and global, inflation event had complex causes, and price stabilization is not expected overnight — no matter who’s the president), and the poster child for stubbornly high prices has become the humble egg.\n\nEgg prices have spiked in recent years because of a nasty and deadly bout of avian flu (and long-established practices to contain the spread).\n\nThe Trump administration last week laid out a five-pronged plan to try to combat bird flu and lower egg prices. While some producers expressed concern that the efforts don’t go far enough, Department of Agriculture officials acknowledged that it could take time to lower prices.\n\nStocks had a blockbuster 2023 and 2024. Heading into 2025, Wall Street expected the good times for markets to keep going this year — just not on the massive scale investors have enjoyed lately.\n\nUS stocks surged last year as strong economic growth, cooling inflation, a series of Federal Reserve rate cuts and enthusiasm for President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory boosted investor optimism. Tech and AI stocks were the stars of 2024, and they were largely expected to lead growth again in 2025.\n\nTwo months into the year, and things have gotten a bit choppy. All three major US indexes closed out February in the red, signaling rising unease on Wall Street.\n\nWhile the broader market remains near an all-time high, uncertainty has swelled around factors such as artificial intelligence-related spending as well as broader economic and geopolitical volatility.\n\nAmerica’s once-in-a-generation housing slump deepened last year, and heading into 2025, it appeared that residential real estate would land in another standoff.\n\nThat outlook was somewhat dour in part because inventory remains low and mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% for at least the next two years. Americans who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the pandemic have little incentive to move into new homes and take on higher borrowing costs.\n\nAdditionally, homebuilders have sounded the alarm on how Trump’s tariff and immigration policies could have a negative effect on housing costs and supply.\n\nStill, real estate is local, and with spring just weeks away, there’s renewed optimism in certain US markets that the scales could tip back toward homebuyers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring down decades-high inflation with a heavy-handed dose of fast-escalating interest rates were highly expected to blunt demand and result in result in higher unemployment — and potentially a recession.\n\nHowever, the US labor market and broader economy proved resilient, keeping the unemployment rate at historically low levels. For perspective, January’s 4% unemployment rate is below what was seen during practically every month in the 1970s, ’80s and ‘90s.\n\nWhile the overall rate remains historically low, the dynamics for people without a job haven’t been the friendliest in recent months. Hiring has softened and labor market churn has slowed, resulting in people staying unemployed for longer.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4% when the February jobs report is released this Friday, economists anticipate it could potentially move higher in the months ahead.\n\nOne particular pressure point could be from the Trump administration’s mass layoffs of federal workers. However, the relative size of those job cuts as well as the timing could lessen their impact on the overall economy.\n\nThe pace of job growth has slowed during the past year. That’s been expected: The blockbuster pandemic recovery couldn’t continue forever; plus, the Federal Reserve’s inflation-busting high interest rates were designed to curb demand.\n\nThe US economy kicked off 2025 by adding 143,000 jobs in January. The monthly gain was lower than expected; however, economists noted it was likely influenced by significant data adjustments that happen at the start of every year as well as frigid weather and devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\n\nJob gains are expected to rebound somewhat when the February report is released Friday; however, there’s less certainty as to what may come in the months ahead from the federal job cuts as well as other stated policies on fronts such as immigration, tax reform, and trade.\n\nSales of existing homes in the US fell last year to the lowest level in almost three decades, as sky-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates squeezed home buyers.\n\nHome prices, meanwhile, continue to escalate. In January, the median price was $446,300, Census Bureau data shows.\n\nFast-rising housing prices have certainly played their part in keeping overall inflation above the Fed’s target. Shelter inflation, which is an amorphous and lagging measure of the average cost of housing in the US, rose to 4.4% year-over-year in January, outpacing overall inflation of 3%.\n\nThe impact of rising home prices has been felt across most of the country: A recent report from the National Association of Realtors found that 89% of metro areas saw an increase in the cost of a single-family home in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThat’s partly due to elevated mortgage rates and chronic underbuilding and potentially worsened by extreme weather events such as wildfires and floods as well as policies that threaten to hike costs of critical homebuilding materials.\n\nIt’s getting to the point where a new car could cost someone $50,000.\n\nIn January, Americans paid a whopping $48,100 on average for a new car, jumping about $10,000 from pre-pandemic times. That means new car prices have risen much faster than most goods and services.\n\nVehicle prices soared in 2021 amid fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and its jumbling of global supply chains. In their case, the semiconductor chip shortage (a result of manufacturers reassigning capacity to consumer tech because the auto factories shuttered amid the pandemic and lower demand) led to limited production of enough cars to meet the sharp rebound in consumer demand.\n\nThe costlier cars — new and used — have come with heftier monthly payments, which have become harder and harder for people to afford.\n\nUnfortunately, it could get worse: Tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports could quickly send car prices soaring, even for those assembled in the United States.\n\nThe cost of producing cars throughout North America will rise between $3,500 and $12,000, according to analysis of both public and private data by the Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based think tank.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department has reinstated two Washington, DC, officers weeks after President Donald Trump pardoned them for their role in the death of 20-year-old Karon Hylton-Brown in 2020, a case that drew protests on the heels of the murder of George Floyd.\n\nBoth officers were reinstated by DC’s police department Monday and are once again being paid, an MPD source with knowledge of the reinstatements told CNN. Officer Terence Sutton and Lt. Andrew Zabavsky had been suspended without pay as the legal process played out.\n\n“Officer Sutton and Lt. Zabavsky have been reinstated. MPD does not comment on personnel matters,” a spokesperson for MPD confirmed to CNN in a statement Monday night.\n\nThe officers will need go through extensive retraining before the department determines what their assignments will be, the MPD source told CNN. It’s unclear if either officer will return to work in a public facing role.\n\nSutton was found guilty of second-degree murder, conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice and sentenced to 66 months in prison. The same jury found Zabavsky guilty of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice, and he faced 48 months behind bars. Zabavsky and Sutton received a “full and unconditional pardon” just days after Trump was inaugurated.\n\nSutton, along with his attorney, declined to comment when reached by CNN Monday. CNN has reached out to Zabavsky and his attorney for comment.\n\nProsecutors argued that in October 2020, Sutton and Zabavsky spotted Hylton-Brown driving a moped helmetless and pursued him at “unreasonable speeds” until he was eventually struck and killed by an uninvolved motorist.\n\nAs Hylton-Brown lay dying in the street, the officers covered up the incident, according to investigators, turning off their body cameras, tampering with the scene and misleading their commanding officers about the nature of the incident.\n\nDefense lawyers disputed details about the encounter and argued the court threw out key evidence that gave the officers reasonable suspicion that Hylton-Brown was going to commit a crime. Kellen Dwyer, an attorney for Sutton, told CNN they expected to overturn the conviction on appeal.\n\nThe DC police department thanked the president for pardoning Sutton and Zabavsky.\n\n“These members could never have imagined that engaging in a core function of their job would be prosecuted as a crime,” MPD said in a statement at the time. “The Department recognizes the risks involved in vehicle pursuits, which are reflected in our pursuit policy. But violations of that policy should be addressed through training and discipline - not through criminal prosecution.”\n\nIn January, Sutton told CNN he was “just overwhelmed” by the pardon and expressed his thanks to the president.\n\n“I want to go back to the police department and finish my career,” he added at the time, saying he had “no clue” if it would be possible.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThroughout its 46-year history, architecture’s most prestigious prize has often been won by icon-builders: the apparent lone geniuses who imprint their visions, signature-like, on the world. It is emblematic of the industry’s shifting priorities that this year’s Pritzker Prize, often dubbed the “Nobel of architecture,” has gone to a man who actively avoids having a recognizable style.\n\nLiu Jiakun, unveiled as 2025’s laureate on Tuesday, has spent much of his four-decade career designing understated academic buildings, museums and public spaces in his home city of Chengdu (and nearby Chongqing), in China’s southwest. His hyper-local and self-admittedly “low-tech” techniques have come at the expense of a distinctive aesthetic.\n\nIn China’s era of architectural excess, Liu has instead quietly thrived by letting each site — and the history, nature and craft traditions surrounding it — shape his designs, not vice versa. Whether repurposing earthquake debris or creating voids in which native wild flora can flourish, methodology matters more than form. In its citation, the Pritzker Prize jury praised Liu for precisely that: having “a strategy instead of a style.”\n\nNature and architecture coalesce at Chengdu's Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum, one of the first projects completed by Liu's firm, Jiakun Architects. Bi Kejian/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nExplaining his approach to CNN ahead of the announcement, the 68-year-old architect (who admitted to being “a little surprised” by the accolade) said he tried to act “like water.”\n\n“I try my best to penetrate and understand the place … then, when the time is right, it will solidify, and the idea of ​​the building will appear,” he said on a video call from Chengdu, adding: “A fixed style is a double-edged sword. It can make others remember you quickly, but it also binds you and makes you lose a certain freedom.”\n\nLiu’s firm, Jiakun Architects, has completed over 30 projects — all in China — in almost as many years. The architect has often turned to his country’s history for inspiration. Traditional pavilions informed the flat rooftop eaves of his Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick in Suzhou; the wraparound balconies of the Shanghai campus he designed for Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis evoke a tiered pagoda. But these nods to the past are never for history’s sake alone, Liu said.\n\n“I focus on the themes that tradition focuses on, rather than the forms that tradition presents,” he explained.\n\nThe eaves and cantilevered verandas of Liu's Novartis Shanghai Campus building put a contemporary spin on traditional Chinese architecture. Arch-Exist/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nIn other words, elements of traditional architecture must be reinterpreted for functional, modern use, not used as tributes to a bygone time. Indeed, China’s cities are inundated with examples of the opposite, whereby curved roofs are added to otherwise characterless structures in the pursuit of an ill-defined “Chinese-ness.”\n\n“Traditional forms … are the results of the culture, technology and people’s philosophy of survival at that time,” Liu explained. “If we focus on the superficial results, we will stop at that time. But if we focus on the themes that tradition has always focused on, but use current technology and methods, then there’s a continuation of tradition.”\n\nChina’s new dawn\n\nBorn in 1956, three years before China’s (and arguably the world’s) most devastating famine, Liu’s childhood revolved around the Chengdu hospital where his mother worked. He demonstrated an early aptitude for art and literature, though, like many of his generation, his teenage years were interrupted by the Cultural Revolution when he was sent to the countryside as part of Mao Zedong’s “educated youth” program.\n\nLiu’s career has, however, neatly coincided with the post-Mao period — one that has seen architecture freed from state control and socialist ideals. He accepted a place at Chongqing’s Institute of Architecture and Engineering in 1978, two years after the former Chinese Communist Party leader’s death, and graduated amid the reform-era policies that opened China’s centrally planned economy to free-market forces.\n\nLiu's museum architecture, including the Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick, was praised by the jury for being \"at once a historical record, a piece of infrastructure, a landscape, and a remarkable public space.\" Liu Jian/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nThis period heralded huge changes for architecture. Key foreign texts and journals from the field entered the country and became more widely available to students and academics. Government-controlled design institutes, like the one Liu worked at in his early career, were finally permitted to charge fees, having previously only served the state. Yet, in the fast-moving atmosphere of 1980s China, Liu still felt architecture “lagged behind.”\n\n“When I graduated, it seemed that architects had nothing to do,” he said. “The economy had not developed, and ideas had not become active.”\n\nBy the early 1990s, Liu — who was, at the time, also pursuing writing — considered quitting the profession altogether. He changed his mind after seeing an exhibition by a former classmate, the architect Tang Hua, that he says inspired him to escape the shadow cast by their sector’s state-controlled past. He established Jiakun Architects, one of the country’s very first private practices, in 1999.\n\nThe firm’s early projects laid a blueprint for understanding Liu’s ethos. His Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum, which opened in Chengdu in 2002, sits serenely in a bamboo forest, its rough concrete and gray shale existing in harmony with the stone artifacts housed within. The recesses and overhangs of his rust-colored Department of Sculpture building, completed for the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in Chongqing two years later, are themselves acts of sculpture. At the Museum of Clocks, also in Chengdu, textural red brickwork alludes more to the area’s humble past than a gleaming future.\n\nThe protruding upper levels of Sichuan Fine Arts Institute's Department of Sculpture allowed Liu to artfully maximize the narrow site's floor space. Arch-Exist/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nAt the Museum of Clocks in Chengdu, sunlight passes through a circular ceiling void and slowly travels across the brick-walled courtyard like a sundial. Bi Kejian/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nAs architecture in China became increasingly bold and bombastic in the 2010s (a trend that eventually led the country’s cabinet, the State Council, to call for the end of “oversized, xenocentric, weird” buildings), Liu’s output remained quiet and unpretentious — even when the scale of his commissions grew. By Liu’s own admission, his firm was always too small to tackle the skyscrapers or mixed-use mega-projects that redrew China’s skylines. But as his oeuvre came to encompass corporate real estate and urban regeneration, his motivations still lay elsewhere.\n\n“I am not very interested in the tendency of making taller and bigger buildings,” he said. “I am not necessarily consciously resisting it. I am just not very interested.”\n\nEveryday architecture\n\nInstead, Liu seeks to redress some of the ills generated by his country’s rampant urbanization.\n\n“China’s cities are developing very fast, so they face two major challenges,” he explained. “One is the relationship with public space, and the other is the relationship with nature. I think my works focus on these two aspects.”\n\nPedestrians and cyclists pictured on the sloped pathways of West Village, which transformed an entire Chengdu block and remains Liu's largest work to date. Arch-Exist/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nSymbiosis between nature and architecture plays out at Liu’s ambitious West Village, an inner-city Chengdu block transformed into a courtyard but at a neighborhood scale. Sloping pathways transport cyclists and pedestrians around a five-story structure that encircles soccer pitches and lush greenery, a park reimagined vertically.\n\nThis huge public gesture is accompanied by many tiny ones. For paving, Liu used bricks perforated with holes and filled with soil, allowing grass to sprout through the middle.\n\nA few miles away, the Shuijingfang Museum has been constructed using similarly thoughtful building blocks: “Rebirth Bricks.” Created by Liu’s firm using rubble from the Wenchuan earthquake, which devastated the Sichuan region in 2008, the reconstructed bricks (made by mixing the rubble with wheat stalks and cement) have been employed in several of his projects. It’s an innovation that typifies why Liu is celebrated for practicing a kind of everyday architecture in which local context reigns large.\n\nLiu's \"Rebirth Bricks,\" made using rubble from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, are pictured in use at the Shuijingfang Museum in Chengdu. DAi Chun/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nAt the Shuijingfang Museum, Liu sensitively surrounded the site's prexisting wood-framed buildings with new concrete structures. Arch-Exist/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nBut does this mean the architect’s vision will always be restricted to China, the country he most intimately understands?\n\nDespite designing the first overseas pavilion for London’s Serpentine Gallery in Beijing in 2018 and lecturing at institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and London’s Royal Academy of Arts, Liu has never completed a project abroad. Asked whether he would relish the prospect of a prestigious international commission, an opportunity winning the Pritzker Prize will surely present, Liu said his approach could indeed be adapted to foreign contexts with sufficient research and preparation.\n\n“From the perspective of method and methodology, there is actually no problem in doing it abroad,” he said, adding: “As long as I am fully familiar with the place, I think (my) set of methods is completely applicable.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nA plan for Gaza formulated by Egypt would exclude Hamas from governance of the enclave once the war ends, a draft of the plan obtained by CNN shows.\n\nThe plan is expected to be discussed by Arab leaders meeting in Cairo in an emergency summit on Tuesday and will be presented to US President Donald Trump in the coming weeks, Jordanian official sources told CNN earlier.\n\nEgypt is proposing the formation of an independent, technocratic Palestinian committee to rule Gaza for an interim 6-month period “under the umbrella of” the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA), whose members would have no affiliations to Palestinian factions, the document said.\n\nBranded “Gaza 2030” and bearing an Egyptian presidential logo, the 91-page document proposes that Egypt and Jordan train Palestinian police forces for deployment to secure the strip.\n\nCNN could not confirm the authenticity of the document and has reached out to Egyptian authorities for comment.\n\nThe proposal was formulated as a response to Trump’s plan to take ownership of Gaza, expel its residents to neighboring countries and turn it into a Middle Eastern “riviera.”\n\nThe plan rejects displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and calls on the international community to address the “humanitarian catastrophe” created by the war in enclave.\n\nThe postwar plan, the document said, requires arrangements for transitional governance “in a way that preserves the two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and “prevents the outbreak of new conflicts.”\n\nArab leaders began arriving in Cairo Tuesday afternoon ahead of the summit.\n\nShopping malls and tourist resorts\n\nThe document lays out an ambitious plan to develop shopping malls, an international convention center and even an airport within five years. It also aims to attract tourists by building resorts and enhancing the enclave’s Mediterranean coast.\n\nEgypt estimates Gaza’s reconstruction costs at $53 billion. Of that, $3 billion would be allocated for rubble removal, clearing unexploded munitions, and constructing temporary housing. An additional $20 billion would fund the first two years of reconstruction, focusing on utilities and permanent housing. The remaining $30 billion would go toward developing a seaport, airport, and industrial zones.\n\nThe proposal also calls on the United Nations Security Council to consider deploying international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank to protect both Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nIt acknowledges the difficulties that could be faced in disarming militants in the strip.\n\n“It is something that can be dealt with, and even ended forever, only if its causes are removed through a clear horizon and a credible political process,” it says.\n\nOn Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that the group’s arms were non-negotiable.\n\n“The weapon of the resistance is a red line, and it is not negotiable,” he said. “We will not accept (any deal) to trade it for reconstruction or the entry of aid.”\n\nHamas has sent mixed signals about its future in Gaza in recent weeks. Analysts have said that while the group has shown that it is willing to discuss demilitarization as an end goal of a peace process, it is keen not to allow it to become a prerequisite of the process.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said last month that the group will not disarm and may even grow after the war in Gaza.\n\nOn Wednesday last week, Hamas official Husam Badran said that the group was willing to step aside from governing Gaza. “Our only condition is for this to be an internal Palestinian matter – we will not allow any regional or international party to get involved,” he told Al Arabiya. “As long as there is national consensus, Hamas will not be involved in the governance.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still refuses to say what he envisions for Gaza’s post-war future, except to say that he endorses Trump’s plan for “a different Gaza.” And he thinks neither the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority nor Hamas should govern Gaza.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump intends to carry through on his expulsion plan. After receiving forceful pushback from Egyptian and Jordanian leaders, Trump told Fox News last month: “The way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it.”\n\nThe plan also comes as a delicate truce between Israel and Hamas hangs by a thread after Israel blocked humanitarian aid into Gaza, in response to Hamas rejecting a new Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire without any commitment to end the war or fully withdraw troops.\n\nHamas has accused Israel of violating the agreement, calling its decision to halt humanitarian aid “cheap blackmail” and a “war crime.”",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nNewly elected Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan will deliver her party’s response to President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday, as Democrats work to define the party’s future following tough losses last fall.\n\nSlotkin’s remarks will be Democrats’ opening volley as the party searches for a compelling, united answer to Trump and the administration’s actions so far amid Republican control of Washington.\n\nThe speech will give a high-profile platform to Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who in November held off an experienced Republican challenger in a state that voted for Trump. Congressional Democratic leaders views her as up-and-coming in the party and believe her ability to win a Senate seat in a state Trump won is evidence of her broad appeal to voters\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Slotkin “a rising star in our party,” telling reporters “the American people are going to love what she has to say. She’s just great on both economic and national security.”\n\nSlotkin acknowledged to CNN last fall that the Democratic Party has struggled to communicate its message to voters. “We also got to get that message out, and we haven’t always been great at that. That’s on us,” she said.\n\nThe Michigan Democrat has said that her goal will be to “level with” the American people during her speech on Tuesday.\n\n“The public expects leaders to level with them on what’s actually happening in our country. From our economic security to our national security, we’ve got to chart a way forward that actually improves people’s lives in the country we all love, and I’m looking forward to laying that out,” she said in a statement.\n\nSlotkin has warned that Trump’s tariff policy could set off a trade war that would be a “gift to foreign automakers.”\n\nProtecting the US auto industry was a central concern for voters in battleground Michigan, where Slotkin and other Democrats argued that Trump’s trade policies and opposition to bolstering electric vehicle production would threaten the critical American industry.\n\nHer Tuesday night delivery comes with high-expectations and risk. GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama faced a backlash after her response to then-President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address last year. Britt told a story of a sex-trafficked woman as she criticized former Biden’s immigration policies, but later acknowledged that the incident did not occur during Biden’s presidency.\n\nAt 48 years old, Slotkin is the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate, but she has entered less as a disruptor and more as a potential swing vote on key issues like immigration. In one of her first votes as a senator, she joined Republicans to pass the Laken Riley Act, a GOP-led bill to require detention of undocumented migrants charged with certain crimes.\n\nHer November win kept a crucial Senate seat in Democratic hands in Michigan, where President Donald Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris by more than 80,000 votes. Slotkin, who had previously won competitive House races to hold onto a Lansing-area seat, defeated former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers to win her Senate seat in November by a slim margin of about 19,000 votes.\n\nSlotkin campaigned on key Democratic issues, like abortion access and gun control, while also making an effort to reach out to Republican voters.\n\n“You will always have an open door in my office. You will always have a place at the table, because I want to hear from you,” Slotkin said in a direct appeal to conservatives during one of her debates against Rogers.\n\nSlotkin asked voters throughout her campaign to “join us on team normal,” casting herself as a commonsense problem solver focused on the concerns of a broad coalition of voters.\n\nBefore serving in the House for six years, Slotkin worked as a CIA analyst and in national security roles under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nAs a graduate student in New York City at the time of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Slotkin said that fateful day changed the trajectory of her career and led her to a life of public service.\n\n“I did not go into graduate school thinking I would choose national service as a career,” she had told CNN, reflecting on what was her second day at Columbia. “By the end of that day, I knew national service was what I was going to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

        "content": "CNN\n\nJason Miller, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, said the president plans to “lean into” tariffs during his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.\n\n”I would say that he’s going to lean into it, and he’s going to talk about how increasing tariffs can actually go and close the trade deficits, which January, we saw a record trade deficit, particularly when it comes to countries such as Canada, Mexico, China,” Miller said when asked by CNN’s Audie Cornish if Trump would have to acknowledge his blanket 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that took effect on Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s senior adviser said the president also plans to “level set” with Americans about the state of the country.\n\n“Typically, this would be done after the first year a president is in office. But since President Trump has already served as president before. He’s going to come in, he’s going to level set with the American people about where exactly we are as a country, what’s happened over these past four years, what he’s been able to accomplish over the last four or five weeks. Then what we still have yet to go and accomplish,” Miller said.\n\nMore on the presidential address: Trump will also discuss what will happen next in his agenda, Miller said.\n\n”We have to go and get this tax bill done. I think you’ll hear the president this evening talk about the one big beautiful bill so we can keep taxes low and take it even lower for Americans. Also need to make sure to make these border fixes permanent,” Miller said.\n\nHe continued, “And then also, as we look ahead, really, we got to look to the future and make sure we’re winning things such as the AI war against China, having a Marshall Plan for energy. So, it’s a bit of where we are, what we’ve accomplished and what we’re going to do, both in the short and in the longer term.”\n\nOn the pause in aid to Ukraine, Miller said Trump is being aggressive in his attempts to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to a deal that would stop the war.\n\n“President Trump is the only person, the only person talking about stopping the killing, and sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,” Miller said. “And in this case, I think President Trump is using the 2 by 4 to go and get his point across to President Zelensky, and that is that President Trump wants to stop the killing. Zelensky has got to get back to the table. He has to take this seriously.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s tiny, but this lab mouse could have a mammoth impact.\n\nWith curly whiskers and wavy, light hair that grows three times longer than that of an ordinary lab mouse, the genetically modified rodent embodies several woolly mammoth-like traits, according to Colossal Biosciences. The private Dallas company is behind efforts to resurrect the mammoth and other extinct animals.\n\nColossal said its woolly mouse would enable its scientists to test hypotheses about the link between specific DNA sequences and physical traits that enabled the mammoth, which went extinct around 4,000 years ago, to adapt to life in cold climates.\n\n“It is an important step toward validating our approach to resurrecting traits that have been lost to extinction and that our goal is to restore,” said Dr. Beth Shapiro, chief science officer at Colossal, in a news release Tuesday. Shapiro is currently on a leave of absence from her role as professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nThe genetically engineered mice are lighter in color than ordinary lab mice. Colossal Biosciences\n\nHow to make a woolly mouse\n\nTo create the woolly mouse, Colossal said it had identified genetic variants in which mammoths differed from their closest living relative: the Asian elephant.\n\nThe company’s scientists then pinpointed 10 variants related to hair length, thickness, texture, color and body fat that corresponded to similar, known DNA variants in a lab mouse.\n\nFor example, scientists targeted a gene known as FGF5 (fibroblast growth factor 5), which targets the cycle of hair growth, creating longer, shaggy hair. They also altered the function of three genes related to hair follicle development and structure to create woolly hair texture, wavy coats and curled whiskers, the company said in a news release.\n\nOther target genes included MC1R (melanocortin 1 receptor), which regulates melanin production, in order to produce mice with golden hair rather than the usual dark fur and a variant associated with changes in body weight.\n\nIn total, the team made eight edits simultaneously, using three cutting-edge techniques, to seven mice genes.\n\nColossal shared an unpublished, or preprint, scientific paper describing the research, which has not undergone peer review.\n\n“I think that the ability to edit multiple genes at the same time in mice, and to do so and obtain the expected woolly appearance, is a very important step,” said Love Dalén, a professor of evolutionary genomics at Stockholm University. Dalén is an advisor to Colossal and was a coauthor on the paper.\n\n“It is a proof-of-principle that Colossal has the know-how to do this kind of gene editing, including to insert mammoth gene variants into a different species.”\n\nColossal Biosciences\n\nJust ‘cute, hairy-looking mice’?\n\nThe research outlined in the unpublished paper was technically impressive and the genetic changes precise and efficient, said Robin Lovell-Badge, head of the Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics Laboratory at The Francis Crick Institute in London.\n\n“My biggest problem with the paper is that there is nothing addressing whether the modified mice are cold-tolerant — through introducing traits that are apparent in mammoths — which is the justification given for carrying out the work,” Lovell-Badge said via email.\n\n“As it is, we have some cute looking hairy mice, with no understanding of their physiology, behaviour, etc. It doesn’t get them any closer to know if they would eventually be able to give an elephant useful mammoth-like traits and we have learned little biology.”\n\nColossal has raised $435 million since it was founded in 2021 by entrepreneur Ben Lamm and Harvard University geneticist George Church.\n\nThe company plans to recreate the mammoth, dodo, and Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, by editing the genome of each species’ closest living relative to make a hybrid animal that would be visually indistinguishable from its extinct forerunner. Ultimately, the company wants to restore the fauna to their natural habitat.\n\nIn the case of mammoths, the company argues that having mammoth-like creatures lumbering through the Arctic would compress the snow and grass that insulates the ground, slowing the rate of permafrost thaw and the release of carbon contained in this fragile ecosystem. Colossal has previously said it’s on track to introduce the first woolly mammoth calves in 2028.\n\nSkeptics argue that the huge sums of money invested in the project could be better spent elsewhere. Raising and breeding the hybrid animals, they say, could imperil living animals used as surrogates.\n\n“While we know a lot about mouse genetics, we know much less about mammoths and elephants. It isn’t yet known which sections of the genome are vital for achieving the characters (needed) to make an elephant fit for life in the Arctic circle,” said Tori Herridge, Senior Lecturer, School of Biosciences, University of Sheffield, in a statement shared by the Science Media Centre. “Genes that are linked to fur and fat in well-studied animals like mice are obvious targets, but the devil is in the detail.”\n\n“Unless you decide to make EVERY edit necessary … in the genome, you are only ever going to create a crude approximation of any extinct creature, based on an incomplete idea of what it should look like. You are never going to ‘bring back’ a mammoth,” she added.\n\nCritics say it will only ever be possible to bring back an incomplete approximation of a mammoth. Colossal Biosciences\n\nLab mice are commonly genetically engineered to have certain traits, including human ones, in order to conduct research on disease and drug development.\n\nRob Taft, a principal scientist at The Jackson Laboratory, a biomedical research institution that helped pioneer humanized lab mice, said via email that the woolly mouse was an “innovative extension of the use of the mouse as a model system and an innovative approach to understanding the physiology of animals that are now extinct.”\n\nHis biggest question was how Colossal would translate this research back to elephants.\n\n“Working with mice or even cattle is relatively easy,” Taft said. “We know a lot about reproduction in these species and assisted reproductive technologies are well developed and used routinely in these species but there’s a lot about elephant reproduction that is not known and assisted reproductive technologies are not well developed for use in elephants.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "New York CNN —\n\nTarget said Tuesday that consumer confidence is declining, and it warned about the impact of tariffs. It’s the latest in a series of red flags about the health of US shoppers and the economy.\n\nThe company said its sales declined in February and it expects sales to only grow around 1% this year.\n\nLast month, sales were “soft” as cold weather impacted clothing spending. But “declining consumer confidence impacted our discretionary assortment overall,” Jim Lee, Target’s chief financial officer, said in a statement. The majority of Target’s merchandise is discretionary, such as clothing and home goods, and the company is highly exposed to any slowdowns.\n\nTarget also said that “tariff uncertainty” will impact its profit this quarter. Target’s (TGT) stock rose very slightly in premarket trading because investors predicted Target’s quarter would be even worse than it was.\n\nAlthough Target expects those trends, which are weighing on customers’ confidence, to moderate, the company said it remains “appropriately cautious” about 2025.\n\nTarget’s sluggish results come after Walmart, America’s largest retailer, warned recently that 2025 would be a rockier year. Walmart said it expected sales to slow down amid concerns about inflation and tariffs.\n\nConsumer confidence last month registered its biggest monthly decline since 2021 as inflation fears creep back.\n\nA global trade war is also breaking out, adding to economic worries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s blanket 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday. Trump also doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%. Those import taxes sit atop existing tariffs on hundreds of billions in Chinese goods. China and Canada immediately retaliated with tariffs on American goods.\n\nThe Trump administration said the tariffs were necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States. But the tariffs threaten to raise the prices Americans pay for a wide array of goods that are imported from the three nations, which collectively import more than 40% of all US goods by value.\n\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that Trump’s tariffs on Mexico may force the company to raise prices on fruits and vegetables as soon as this week. Cornell said Target relies heavily on Mexican produce imports during the winter.\n\n“Those are categories where we’ll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,” he said.\n\nBacklash to Target’s DEI pullback\n\nTarget is also under pressure from consumers frustrated by its shift away from diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.\n\nDays into the Trump presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it remained committed to “creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities” and also stressed the need for “staying in step with the evolving external landscape.”\n\nTarget’s retreat sparked anger from progressive customers and boycott calls, particularly from Black consumers.\n\nRev. Jamal Bryant of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, has called for 100,000 people to begin a 40-day boycott of Target on Wednesday to coincide with the start of Lent. Participants are encouraged to purchase products from Black-owned businesses during this period.\n\nThere are signs that the blowback from Target’s move is impacting the company.\n\nCustomer visits to Target, Walmart and Costco have slowed over the last four weeks, but they have dropped the most at Target, according to Placer.ai., which uses phone location data to track visits. The slowdown could also be attributed to weather, economic conditions and other variables, Placer.ai cautioned.\n\nDuring the week of February 17, the latest week available, foot traffic to Target dropped 7.9% and 5.2% to Walmart. Foot traffic to Costco, which has stood by its DEI policies, increased 4.8%.\n\nThe data “shows a clear drop in traffic in late January into mid-February following the company’s step back from DEI,” Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in a note to clients last week.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.",

        "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nA teenage girl bullied with AI-generated deepfakes, the family of the firefighter killed during the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the mother and sister of slain student Laken Riley are among those headed to the US Capitol Tuesday evening where President Donald Trump is set to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nTrump’s remarks will both touch on his accomplishments of the first six weeks of his presidency and offer a preview of upcoming priorities as he has reimagined the use of executive authority, shifted the role of the US in the world and transformed the size and scope of the federal government. The theme of Tuesday’s address, according to the White House, is “the renewal of the American dream.”\n\nAnd the guest list for first lady Melania Trump’s box could offer a blueprint for what to expect from the speech. Each guest has a connection to a Trump administration policy.\n\nThe first lady’s 15 guests represent key administration accomplishments – from an executive order banning transgender women from women’s sports to its efforts to bring home Marc Fogel, an American who was wrongfully imprisoned by Russia. They also represent issues the administration has vowed to tackle, including a push by the first lady to pass a bill to protect Americans from AI-generated deepfake and revenge pornography to the economy and border security.\n\n“These men, women, and families come from all different walks of life with incredible stories about the disaster wrought by the previous administration, and the historic achievements President Trump has already enacted,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nHere’s who to watch for during Tuesday’s speech:\n\nThe Comperatore family\n\nHelen, Allyson, and Kaylee Comperatore, the widow and daughters of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter shot and killed during the attempted assassination of Trump, will be among the first lady’s guests. Corey Comperatore died trying to protect his family, according to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, shielding them from bullets that ultimately took his life.\n\nImmigration and border security\n\nThere will be multiple guests representing Trump’s border security policies, including Alexis Nungaray, the mother of a 12-year-old, Jocelyn, who was murdered when she went on a walk to a Houston convenience store. Two undocumented immigrants from Venezuela have been charged with her murder.\n\nAllyson and Lauren Phillips, the mother and sister of Laken Riley, will also be in attendance. Riley, a 22-year old Georgia student, was killed last year while out for a run. An undocumented migrant from Venezuela was convicted and sentenced to life without parole. Trump’s first major legislative victory, the Laken Riley Act, requires detention of undocumented migrants charged with certain crimes.\n\nAnd Roberto Ortiz, an agent with Customs and Border Protection, “has been shot at repeatedly by cartel members while performing his duties near the Rio Grande River in Texas,” according to the White House.\n\nCrime\n\nThe Trumps will welcome Stephanie Diller, the widow of Jonathan Diller, a New York City Police Department officer who was shot and killed during a traffic stop in Queens in March 2024 . During the 2024 campaign, then-candidate Trump attended a memorial service for Diller.\n\n“We have to get back to law and order,” he said after the service.\n\nCulture wars\n\nTrump is likely to highlight his executive action to deliver on a political issue central to his 2024 campaign, banning transgender women from competing in women’s sports, during his remarks Tuesday.\n\nThe first lady will host Payton McNabb, “a former high school athlete who had her dreams of competing in college sports crushed in a September 2022 volleyball match when a biological man playing on the opposing women’s team spiked the volleyball at Payton’s face, leaving her with a traumatic brain injury,” according to the White House.\n\nThe first lady is also hosting January Littlejohn, “a mother and parents’ rights advocate who sued the School Board of Leon County after school officials at her daughter’s middle school socially transitioned her daughter to a different sexual identity without January and her husband’s knowledge or permission,” per the White House.\n\nRussia talks\n\nMarc Fogel, an American teacher wrongfully detained for more than three years in Russia, returned to the US last month through a deal negotiated by President Trump, Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, “and the President’s advisers,” according to a statement from national security adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nJoined by his 95-year-old mother Malphine, Fogel’s release marked the start of US talks with Russia as the president has sought to position himself as a dealmaker to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. Trump has subsequently suspended aid to war-torn Ukraine.\n\nThe economy\n\nThe president is likely to highlight kitchen table issues and domestic manufacturing during his address on Tuesday, coinciding with planned tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China.\n\nJeff Denard will be among the Trumps’ guests. Denard, per the White House, “has spent nearly three decades working at a steel plant owned by Nucor Steel. His good paying, middle class job at the steel plant has allowed Jeff to serve as volunteer firefighter, provide a loving home to dozens of foster children, and organize his fellow steelworkers to respond to natural disasters, including Hurricane Helene.”\n\nFirst lady priorities\n\nIn her first public remarks of her husband’s second term, Melania Trump went to Capitol Hill on Monday to push for the passage of the “TAKE IT DOWN” Act, a bill aimed at protecting Americans from AI-generated deepfake and revenge pornography. Elliston Berry, 15, joined Trump to tell her story.\n\n“They superimposed her (Elliston’s) face into pornographic content without her consent, solely to humiliate her. And although Elliston’s family contacted the social media companies for help, their efforts fell upon deaf ears. Ultimately, the fake images circulated worldwide,” the first lady said.\n\nElliston will be sitting with the first lady.\n\nTrump is also seeking to highlight the foster care community through her “Foster the Future” initiative. Haley Ferguson, a former foster child, is a college student studying elementary education who received a scholarship from that initiative, according to the White House.\n\nCNN’s Zoe Sottile, Clare Foran, and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nMillie Bobby Brown has spoken out against a series of articles criticizing her appearance during her ongoing press tour for the Netflix film, “The Electric State.” On Monday, the “Stranger Things” actor posted a video on Instagram where she called out the media for “bullying” and “tearing young women down,” and addressed each journalist that had scrutinized her looks by name.\n\nOver the past week, Brown has been the subject of several articles after she debuted a blonde ‘90s blowout while promoting her new film. While the platinum look, paired with ‘90s and Y2K-inspired ensembles, generated excitement among fans who hoped that it was Brown’s way of hinting at her role in a Britney Spears biopic, other publications criticized the actor for having “aged far beyond her years.”\n\nBrown, whose career in the entertainment industry began at 10 years old, fired back at articles that questioned the changes in her appearance as she matured. Among those she called out had headlines such as “What has Millie Bobby Brown done to her face?” and “Millie Bobby Brown mistaken for someone’s mom as she guides younger sister Ava through LA”.\n\n“I grew up in front of the world, and for some reason, people can’t seem to grow with me,” said Brown on Instagram. “Instead, they act like I’m supposed to stay frozen in time, like I should look the way I did on ‘Stranger Things’ Season 1. And now because I don’t, I’m a target.”\n\nBrown, now 21, pointed out that the focus on her looks was not only cruel but reflected the unrealistic standards directed at young women. “The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices, it’s disturbing,” she said. “The fact that some of these articles are written by women? Even worse.”\n\nShe isn’t the only star who has fought back at judgmental comments made about their appearance in recent years. In 2023, Madonna similarly took to Instagram after photos of her performing at the Grammys went viral — sparking comments that she was “obsessed with plastic surgery” (the singer has never publicly addressed rumors of cosmetic enhancements). The 66-year-old musician wrote that “ageism and misogyny… permeates the world we live in,” adding that the world “refuses to celebrate women past the age of 45.”\n\nBrown’s Instagram video — which, at the time of writing, has 1.6 million likes, accumulated in less than 12 hours — has received an outpour of support from A-listers such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Sharon Stone, Matthew Modine and Winnie Harlow. Brown herself ended the post on a defiant note: “I refuse to apologize for growing up,” she said. “Let’s do better. Not just for me, but for every young girl who deserves to grow up without fear of being torn apart for simply existing.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nA while back, when she was promoting her book about her distinct style, Dolly Parton was asked if her husband Carl Dean had a favorite outfit of hers.\n\nParton got a dreamy smile on her face as she remembered.\n\n“I used to have a pair of a pair of red velvet hot pants back when hot pants were in style,” she told CNN during the 2023 interview. “I mean, a thousand years ago. He loved those pants and he’d often say, ‘Where’s your red velvet hot pants?’ And so I wore those for years just on request of course.”\n\nIt was announced Monday that Dean, her husband of almost 60 years, had died. He was 82.\n\nDean was famous, in part, for his desire to stay out of the spotlight. Despite being married to one of the biggest stars in the world, he was not a part of his wife’s celebrity world.\n\nParton told People in a 2016 interview that her husband was a “loner.”\n\n“He doesn’t particularly care about being around anybody but me,” she said. “He’s just always asked me to leave him out of all this. He does not like all the hullabaloo.”\n\nThe year before, she told Parade she had “married a really good man, a guy that’s completely different from me.”\n\n“He’s not in show business. He’s not resentful of any of that. He loves to hear about the things I do,” Parton said. “I love to hear about the things he does. So we enjoy each other’s company. We get along good. He’s got a great sense of humor. We’ve just been best buddies and best friends and, evidently, it’s working!”\n\nThe singer met Dean in Nashville in 1964, when she was visiting her uncle and his wife who had just moved there.\n\nParton later recalled in a 1976 New York Times article that she was headed to the laundromat as she had traveled so quickly her clothes were dirty when Dean spotted her, “hollered” at her and she said hello.\n\nDolly parton and Carl Dean in a photo she shared on Instagram. Dolly Parton/Instagram\n\n“Bein’ from the country, I spoke to everybody,” Parton told the publication. “And he came over and, well, it was Carl, my husband.”\n\nParton said she initially refused to go out with Dean and instead invited him to come sit on the porch with her at her aunt and uncle’s house.\n\n“He came up every day that week and we set out on the porch. I wouldn’t even take him in the house,” she said. “Then my aunt got a day off… and that was my first chance to go anywhere with Carl and he drove me straight to his folks’ house and introduced me to his mother and daddy. Cause he said he knew right the minute he saw me that that’s the one he wanted.”\n\nThe pair married in 1966 and renewed their vows in honor of their 50th anniversary in 2016.\n\nThat year he gave a rare interview to “Entertainment Tonight.”\n\n“My first thought was ‘I’m gonna marry that girl,’” Dean said of that first meeting with Parton. “My second thought was, ‘Lord she’s good lookin.’” And that was the day my life began. I wouldn’t trade the last 50 years for nothing on this earth.”\n\nParton also celebrated her husband being the yin to her yang, telling Us Weekly in 2022, “We’re the perfect partners.”\n\n“We both have great sense of humor,” she said. “We’re able to, like, solve any problems and any situation, making a joke about it and not letting it get too heavy, but we respect each other and we like each other. We lucked up, let’s put it that way.”\n\nBut he was so private.\n\n“That has led a lot of people to believe that my husband doesn’t exist and that I made him up,” Parton wrote in her 2020 memoir, “Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics,” “\n\nThe couple never had children, something Parton, who was one of 12 children, told Billboard she did not regret.\n\n“I used to think I should regret it. Early on, when my husband and I were dating, and then when we got married, we just assumed we would have kids. We weren’t doing anything to stop it,” she said. “In fact, we thought maybe we would. We even had names if we did, but it didn’t turn out that way. Now I say, ‘God didn’t mean for me to have kids so everybody’s kids could be mine.’”\n\n“I’m very close to my family — five of my younger brothers and sisters lived with me and Carl for many years — and we’re very close to our nieces and nephews,” she added. “Now that Carl and I are older, we often say, ‘Aren’t you glad we didn’t have kids? Now we don’t have kids to worry about.’”",

        "title": "Trump pauses military aid to Ukraine after Oval Office argument with Zelensky, White House official says",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump is ordering a pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine after his heated Oval Office argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official told CNN Monday.\n\nThe halt in aid, which came after Trump held a series of meetings with top national security officials at the White House, could have dire effect on Ukraine’s war-fighting abilities, officials and analysts said. It will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said, essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield.\n\n“The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” the White House official said.\n\nAfter more than a week of open hostility between Washington and Kyiv, Monday’s pause was the most material sign of how far the relationship has deteriorated since Trump took office.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s talking points, falsely claiming Ukraine started the war and accusing Zelensky of being a dictator, but his decision to halt the delivery of military aid is a move that could have real consequences for the balance of the conflict and strengthen Putin’s hand.\n\nThe pause will apply to all military equipment not yet inside Ukraine, officials said, and amounts to a direct response to what Trump views as Zelensky’s bad behavior last week.\n\nUkraine could likely sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks — perhaps until the start of the summer — before a US pause would begin to have a major effect, Western officials said in the wake of the decision. The Biden administration rushed shipments of weapons to Ukraine in its waning days, providing the country with large stockpiles of advanced weapons.\n\nIt is those sophisticated weapons — including the long-range ATACMS missiles — that have allowed Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, a strategy that could suffer if those weapons remain paused.\n\nWhile European nations may be able to replace US shipments of artillery, supplemented by Ukraine’s own growing defense industry, the most advanced weapons used by Kyiv come from the United States.\n\nImpact could be ‘crippling’\n\n“The impact is going to be big. I would call it crippling,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has closely followed the war.\n\nCancian estimated that Ukraine would feel the impacts of the pause in aid within two to four months, as aid from European countries helps Kyiv remain in the fight for now. “That’s why they don’t fall off a cliff, but when your supplies get cut in half, eventually that shows up on the front lines,” Cancian said. “Their front lines would continue to buckle and eventually they would break and Ukraine would have to accept an adverse – even catastrophic – peace settlement.”\n\nBut Cancian warned the Trump administration has more forms of aid to Ukraine that can be paused or canceled altogether, including intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces. “There might be a way out of this, but it’s going to be extremely humiliating for Zelensky,” Cancian said.\n\nThe White House made the decision to pause military aid to Ukraine for now as officials seek an acknowledgement from Zelensky about the breakdown in relations following Friday’s blowup in the Oval Office.\n\nAccording to several officials, Trump and his senior aides are seeking an acknowledgement from Zelensky – potentially in the form of a public apology – before moving ahead with a deal on Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, which had been close to agreement before Friday’s meeting, or a discussion on continuing foreign aid. The decision to halt the aid was made later on Monday, one person said, and is part of a pressure strategy on Ukraine.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio publicly called for Zelensky to apologize for Friday in an interview on CNN.\n\nThe halt puts Trump even more clearly at odds with the United States’ traditional European allies like Britain and France, who made clear their support for Zelensky at a summit in London on Sunday.\n\n“There is a capability gap that Europe cannot fill alone,” one US official said.\n\nA European official called the Trump administration’s decision to pause military aid to Ukraine “petty and wrong.”\n\nThe official said it will immediately deepen distrust in the US government among the Ukrainian people. The official also predicted it will cause unnecessary civilian casualties, as Ukraine will not be able to defend against Russian air attacks after they run out of air defense missiles.\n\n“I’m beyond disappointed,” the official told CNN\n\nSince the start of the war, the Biden administration announced 74 separate packages of military aid pulled directly from US inventories, allowing the critical munitions and supplies to flow quickly to Ukraine. The largest of these packages was nearly $3 billion, though most were far smaller. Zelensky has repeatedly thanked the US for the weapons on social media, as well as in calls and meetings with American officials.\n\nThe pause comes one day after a defense official told CNN that military aid to Ukraine announced by the Biden administration was still flowing. Those shipments included critical munitions such as anti-tank weapons, thousands of artillery rounds, and rockets. Those shipments were expected to continue for several weeks, but the decision from the Trump administration freezes the aid that was en route.\n\n“DoD is also providing other capabilities, such as armored vehicles, as soon as required repairs are completed,” the defense official said on Sunday. The US had set up facilities in Poland to repair Western equipment damaged on the battlefield before sending it back to the Ukrainian military.\n\nThere are also multiple longer-term contracts between arms manufacturers and the US to send weapons systems and air defense systems to Ukraine.\n\nMixed reaction from Republicans\n\nRepublicans in Congress, where the party holds majorities in both chambers, have been split on continuing aid to Ukraine amid its three-year war with Russia.\n\nEarlier Monday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, said he thought the US obligation to Ukraine only goes “so far,” saying, “the American taxpayers are tired of funding this war, and there’s no end in sight.”\n\n“I don’t believe that any of us sitting here believes that Ukraine can win this war, and the president is saying, ‘Let’s bring an end to it,’” the Oklahoma Republican continued, adding that if Zelensky wants the US to continue negotiating peace, “then we will.”\n\nHowever, he warned if Zelensky “doesn’t want to negotiate peace, then it’s not our job to make the taxpayers continue to fund an endless war.”\n\nGOP Sen. Susan Collins, however, denounced the pause on Monday night, arguing that the US needs to continue backing its ally.\n\n“This is a critical time for Ukraine. And I managed the Ukraine supplemental last year that provided additional help to Ukraine, and I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It’s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,” the Maine Republican said.\n\nCollins acknowledged that Congress may not be able to do anything to ensure Ukraine continues to receive aid from the US.\n\n“A lot of it is linked to the president’s drawdown authority,” she noted, pointing to accusations during former President Joe Biden’s term that he had “slow walked” aid.\n\n“Unfortunately, we’ve seen this movie before, and I remain convinced that it’s not only in Ukraine’s interest but our interest to back Ukraine because Putin is not going to stop there,” she said.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chair Republican Rep. Brian Mast told CNN he “knew it was an option” for the Trump administration to pause all US military aid to Ukraine.\n\n“I think people can assume that everything is on the table with Ukraine right now,” he said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Morgan Rimmer, Annie Grayer, Ali Main, Manu Raju and Sarah Davis contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "New York CNN —\n\nUS stocks slid Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to levy tariffs on Canada and Mexico, paving the way for a global trade war.\n\nThe hefty tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could contribute to a crash in the global economy, similar to the Great Depression of the 1930s, said Andrew Wilson, the deputy secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n“Our deep concern is that this could be the start of a downward spiral that puts us in 1930s trade-war territory,” Wilson said.\n\nThe Dow opened lower and fell 500 points, or 1.16%. The broader S&P 500 slid 1.05% and the Nasdaq Composite was down by 0.86%.\n\nThe 25% tariff on goods imported from the US’s closest trading partners comes after Trump also imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, raising that country’s rate to 20%.\n\nThe broad-based levies are intended to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States, the Trump administration said.\n\nHowever, the impact of tariffs on everyday goods for Americans could stall the economic engine that drives US growth. Inflation-weary consumers are already starting to rein in their spending as uncertainty ripples through households. Layoffs are rising, consumer confidence has plunged, and inflation is still above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%.\n\n“The market finally took the Trump administration at its word, and the realization that the tariff talk wasn’t just a negotiating tactic is starting to sink in,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a note Tuesday.\n\nChina immediately struck back Tuesday, announcing tariffs on chicken, pork, beef and some agricultural imports from the US, according to a statement from the State Council Tariff Commission. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said hours before the tariffs took effect that Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on billions of dollars of US goods.\n\nWhile Trump has long signaled his intent to impose stringent levies on America’s trading partners, many investors believed the threat of tariffs was a negotiation strategy. But as the deadline neared, fear rose that Trump’s actions would spark a trade war.\n\nThat triggered a massive selloff on Wall Street on Monday: The Dow ended the day down by 650 points, the S&P had its worst day since December and the Nasdaq Composite flirted with correction territory.\n\n“While Tuesday’s tariffs are a go, it remains very unclear on just how long these tariffs will remain,” wrote Clark Geranen, chief market strategist at CalBay Investments, in a note Tuesday. “We tend to believe these are more of a negotiation tactic and not the start of a long and drawn out reciprocal trade war. Still, in these situations, investors sell first and ask questions later, as seen during Monday’s selloff.”\n\nGeorge Smith, portfolio strategist for LPL Financial, said in an email that as troubling as a large one-day decline in the S&P 500 can be, it’s important to put it in context. US stocks also closed at record highs just last week.\n\n“While every situation is different, historically, buying the dip after such single day declines has been a successful strategy on average,” Smith said.\n\nTrump is scheduled later Tuesday to deliver to Congress the first address of his second term. The theme of that speech, “Renewal of the American Dream,” comes as the stock market has now erased all gains since he became president and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s real-time GDP forecast projects the economy could contract by 2.8%.\n\n“Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Tuesday for the sixth day in a row, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nAmerican consumers and businesses stand to pay a hefty price for the tariffs President Donald Trump enacted on the nation’s top three trading partners.\n\nWith only a slim exemption for some Canadian energy products, everything the US imports from those three nations is subject to tariffs of at least 20%, in the case of China, and 25% for Mexico and Canada.\n\nAmericans won’t necessarily feel the full effects of tariffs immediately but the import taxes could raise prices of just about everything, especially given that over 40% of the goods America imported last year came from the nations Trump targeted.\n\nJust how high prices will get – and when – all depend on the extent to which businesses will absorb the higher cost of tariffs or reconfigure their supply chains to minimize costs, as well as how much inventory they have on hand.\n\nHere’s where Americans could feel the sting hardest:\n\nFood\n\nMexico and Canada supply a significant share of several key food categories. For example, Mexico is the largest supplier of fruit and vegetables to the United States, while Canada leads in exports of grain, livestock and meats, poultry and more.\n\nAgricultural products from Mexico and Canada, in particular, could become more expensive for consumers, as grocery retailers operate on thinner profit margins than most industries. With little room to absorb higher tariff costs, the grocers may have to pass them on to shoppers.\n\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that Trump’s tariffs on Mexico may force the company to raise prices on fruits and vegetables as soon as this week. Cornell said Target relies heavily on Mexican produce imports during the winter.\n\n“Those are categories where we’ll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,” he said.\n\nAlthough the US typically exports more agricultural goods than it imports, the value of imports has increased faster than that of exports in the past decade, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Additionally, climate change has increased US reliance on countries like Mexico, where growing conditions are more favorable.\n\nLast year, the US imported $46 billion of agricultural products from Mexico, according to USDA data. That includes $8.3 billion worth of fresh vegetables, $5.9 billion of beer and $5 billion of distilled spirits.\n\nBut the biggest category of agricultural imports from Mexico last year was fresh fruits, of which the US imported $9 billion worth, with avocados accounting for $3.1 billion of that total.\n\nAnd on top of the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, Trump also on Monday floated a separate tariff on agricultural imports, which could further increase the price of foods coming from these countries and worldwide.\n\nElectronics, toys, appliances\n\nConsumer electronics are among the top goods the US imported from China last year, according to federal trade data. That includes cellphones, TVs, laptops, video game consoles, monitors and all the components that power them.\n\nChina also is a major supplier of home appliances. Those along with toys and footwear are particularly exposed to Trump’s tariff threats.\n\nA staggering 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands.\n\nMore than half (56%) of shoes sold in the United States are made in China, the trade group said.\n\nThe United States is also reliant on China for toys and sporting equipment, including items such as footballs, soccer balls and baseballs. The United States gets 75% of its imported toys and sports equipment from China.\n\nCars and car parts\n\nMany electronics Americans purchase come from China and Mexico.\n\nCars sold in America are no longer purely American-made. In many cases, parts cross between the Mexican and Canadian borders several times before a car is completed –– either in the US or a neighboring country. Automakers built plants across North America in what had been a free trade zone.\n\n“There’s probably not a vehicle on the market today that wouldn’t be affected in some form or fashion by tariffs,” Peter Nagle, automotive economist for S&P Global Mobility, told CNN. “I would think prices would start to change in the one-to-two weeks after the tariffs go into effect.”\n\nThe cost of producing cars throughout North America will rise between $3,500 and $12,000, according to analysis of both public and private data by the Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based think tank. And because it won’t make sense to make some of the models at those higher costs, particularly cars with cheaper option packages, there are likely to be cutbacks in production, and jobs, across the industry, said Patrick Anderson, the group’s CEO.\n\n“Producers will stop making some of the models,” Anderson predicted. And he said the suggestion by Trump that automakers will quickly shift production back to the United States in response isn’t at all realistic. That’s an expensive proposition that could take years to achieve.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nMillions of federal workers were ordered to return to offices across the country in recent weeks, marking an end to Covid-era rules allowing more flexibility to work from home.\n\nMany have come back to workplaces that weren’t ready for them.\n\nIn one Department of Health and Human Services office, there was no Wi-Fi or full electricity in the first hours when people returned last week.\n\nDepartment of Education employees at an office in Dallas returned to ethernet cords in piles around the floor, random wires sticking out of walls, and motion-sensor lights that weren’t working correctly, leading to dark workspaces. One employee tripped over a pile of cords on her first day back, resulting in a large gash on her foot. She’s submitted a workers’ compensation complaint.\n\nEthernet cords lay on the floor at a Department of Education office in Dallas. Obtained by CNN\n\nAnd a Department of Defense employee who returned to in-office work and handles sensitive information was stuck in a conference room with people on different teams, forcing them to leave the room to make calls. The employee was eventually moved to an office — but one without Wi-Fi, so they had to use their phone’s spotty hot spot.\n\n“The only thing a return to the office has given me is an hour of traffic while driving and a loss in efficiency,” said the worker, who requested anonymity for fear of job reprisals.\n\nThe problems, confusion and slipups that federal employees told CNN they’ve encountered returning to the office have only added to the chaos inside the workforce six weeks into a Trump administration determined to slash the size and scope of the federal government.\n\nSome federal workers being told to return to the office have no space to return to. At least two office buildings used by the Interior Department in the Western US were told last week their leases had been canceled, according to a source familiar with the matter — while a third office housing hundreds of people was notified its lease will be up in June.\n\nOne source said the General Services Administration, which manages federal buildings, did not appear to coordinate the lease terminations with Interior officials, leaving employees unclear of what to do. An Interior spokesperson said the department was “working with GSA to ensure facilities or alternative options will be available” for employees.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly demanded all federal workers return to the office as his administration has undertaken sweeping actions seeking to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce, including mass firings of probationary workers and employees in government diversity departments.\n\nTrump’s in-office mandate has been coupled with a push to slash government real estate, setting up a dilemma of too little space for too many people. Even before Trump took office in January, the federal government was downsizing office space due in part to the shift toward telework during the pandemic.\n\nNearly half of the more than 2.3 million civilian federal workers were eligible for telework, and 10% were in remote positions with no expectation of in-person work, according to a 2024 Office of Management and Budget report. Many workers stopped working full time in their offices during the Covid-19 pandemic, but others had long-held arrangements for working from home — and now could face the prospect of choosing between fundamentally changing their job or leaving it altogether.\n\nMore than 80% of federal workers reside outside the Washington, DC, metro area, meaning the return-to-office mandate will cause ripple effects across the country.\n\nSome government employees are now making the post-pandemic transition that millions of private-sector workers already have — upending their lives and schedules in the process. For many federal employees, however, those worries have been subsumed by their larger fear of losing jobs entirely in Trump’s multipronged effort to shrink the federal workforce.\n\nFederal workers and union officials told CNN they see this as part of an attempt by the Trump administration to make life uncomfortable for federal workers in hopes that some will quit.\n\nTrump and Elon Musk, de facto chief of the Department of Government Efficiency, have both threatened to fire workers who do not come back to the office, even those represented by unions who have signed long-term telework agreements. Many federal agencies set February 24 as the first date for some of their employees to comply with Trump’s return-to-office directive.\n\n“If they don’t report for work, we’re firing them. In other words, you have to go to office,” Trump said at a conservative political conference last month, while claiming that his golf game would improve dramatically if he were to work remotely.\n\nFederal employee unions have argued Trump’s demand to break long-term telework agreements is unlawful, though the return-to-office mandate isn’t central to the major legal challenges unions have brought against the president. But there have been pockets of pushback, such as the employee union at the Environmental Protection Agency, which is demanding to bargain around the return-to-office mandate. Additionally, some individual EPA employees represented by the union are filing grievances around returning to the office.\n\nOne of their biggest concerns, an EPA union official told CNN, is “local fire and safety regulations — how many people can you jam into a room?”\n\nSlashing real estate as workers return\n\nDOGE has kept a running list on its website touting more than 200 building leases the Musk-run agency says it’s canceled. The canceled leases, which include Social Security Administration and US attorneys’ offices, have raised questions locally about where those employees are supposed to go.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order last week instructing each government agency to identify all leases that can be terminated and submit a plan to dispose of “government-owned real property which has been deemed by the agency as no longer needed.”\n\nThe drive to shrink the federal government’s real estate portfolio predates the Trump administration. The Office of Management and Budget issued a “Reduce the Footprint” directive in 2015 that requires agencies to make more efficient use of federal property and dispose of surplus assets.\n\nLast year’s OMB report included a list of agencies’ efforts to downsize their holdings. For instance, the Department of Veterans Affairs reduced office space in its headquarters locations in the Washington, DC, metro area by 16% between 2020 and 2022, saving $15 million annually.\n\nThe GSA cut its own footprint by more than 2 million square feet over 10 years, avoiding $300 million in costs. And the Department of Energy moved out of 193,000 square feet of leased space in 2023, saving $9 million annually.\n\nThe General Services Administration building in Washington, DC, on Monday, February 24. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThose downsizings have had an impact. One federal employee still waiting for their date to return to the office told CNN they suspect it’s been delayed because of a lack of room. Their agency, which the employee asked not to name because of concerns for their job, has been shedding office space for several years, so teleworking staffers have had to reserve desks in the remaining locations for the days they come in.\n\nThe space constraint, coupled with the Trump administration’s reduction-in-force order, has the worker fearing their agency will suffer heavy layoffs. “The only way RTO (return-to-office) works in these types of situations is if you now reduce the number of people,” the employee said.\n\n‘There was very little prep’\n\nMultiple federal agencies brought the bulk of their employees back last week, a return that was met in some cases with a lack of desks, basic supplies and working equipment.\n\n“There was very little prep and planning and it was messy with equipment,” an HHS staffer told CNN. The employee, who asked for their specific location not to be named, said there were reports of Wi-Fi and electricity not working.\n\nAsked about the issue, Andrew Nixon, HHS’ communications director, said the agency is complying with Trump’s return to the office executive order. “We look forward to seeing and collaborating with our colleagues in person to Make America Healthy Again,” he continued.\n\nThe Department of Education sent an email last week to staff in regional offices acknowledging the shortcomings in some facilities on Day 1 of their return.\n\n“At the present time we are unable to deploy full peripheral setups in the regional/remote offices,” the department’s Office of the Chief Information Officer told employees in an email, which was obtained by CNN.\n\nSheria Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252 in Dallas and a Department of Education employee, said her office was “chaos” when employees returned. She filed the workers’ comp complaint after injuring her foot tripping over a pile of cords on the floor.\n\n“The facilities were not actually ready for us to return,” Smith said.\n\n“No one is on-site to try to fix the issues,” she added, saying the mess leads her to believe “they would be hoping that we would quit, I guess — that they didn’t expect us to come.”\n\nAnother Department of Education employee in Washington, DC, said the first week back lacked basic office needs: computers, pens and headsets — as well as private space and conference rooms necessary for confidential job requirements.\n\nAt the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, a telework policy has been in place for more than 20 years, officials said. Many employees had been teleworking three to four days a week and are now adapting to the rigidity of returning to the office.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gather to protest against Department of Government Efficiency cuts outside the headquarters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Silver Spring, Maryland. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n“Morale is pretty low,” a staffer in the agency said. “If you have a dentist appointment at 3 p.m. near where you live, and it ends at 4:15 p.m., you cannot work that last hour from home. You have to go back to the office or take sick leave.”\n\nThe return-to-office mandate comes as budget cuts at EPA led to reduced cleaning and facility services at key offices, even before the Trump administration took over.\n\nIn the three major EPA offices around the country that make up the agency’s headquarters — Washington, Cincinnati and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina — health units were closed and in-office mail delivery was cut back, according to a memo obtained by CNN. In Cincinnati, drinking fountain cleaning schedules were reduced to once per week, carpets and hallways were swept once a month, and bathroom cleanings were pared back to once a day.\n\n“With these people coming back to the offices, they’re going to have fewer facility services,” the EPA union official said.\n\nAn EPA spokesperson noted that agencies have been working under a continuing resolution that left funding flat. If Congress passes a full-year appropriation, then “the agency will make funding decisions that support the return to in-person work.”\n\nDifferent rules across agencies\n\nThe 2024 OMB report found those eligible for telework spend about 60% of their working hours in the office, on average, though that figure varies widely by agency. About 10% of staffers have remote jobs, where they are not expected to report to an office at all, according to the report, which noted the Biden administration also directed agencies to increase the amount of time federal workers spent at the office.\n\nThe Biden administration’s goal was for teleworkers to spend at least 50% of the time in the office. Now Trump turned that into a full-time mandate.\n\nBut not all federal workers are returning at the same pace, as Trump’s executive order, issued hours after he took office in January, directed agencies to terminate remote work arrangements “as soon as practicable.”\n\nSeveral agencies, including the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, have said political appointees, senior executives and other senior staffers could no longer work remotely or telework as of February 24, and neither could supervisors who live within 50 miles of an agency facility.\n\nOthers have more time. For instance, at the VA, lower-level non-union employees who live within 50 miles of a facility will have their remote and telework arrangements terminated by April 28, except for ad hoc or situational circumstances, the agency said. But these arrangements for supervisors and other non-union employees who reside farther away were not ended — those staffers will receive additional guidance.\n\nAs for union workers at the VA, their return-to-office date will be announced at a later time, the agency said.\n\nAt the Department of Education, more than 70% of its workforce started reporting to the Washington and regional offices full time last week, the agency said in a news release. The rest are expected back by June 1 after building renovations and relocation arrangements are complete.\n\nHowever, many union members at the Department of Housing and Urban Development who were previously able to telework on certain days had to return to the office full time in late February, said Antonio Gaines, president of the AFGE Council 222, which represents 5,300 employees at the agency. Workers at some regional and field offices are exempt for now because of lack of space and safety concerns, including building renovations and inadequate HVAC systems.\n\nThe mandate violates the union’s collective bargaining agreement, he argued.\n\n“They made a unilateral decision to bypass the negotiating process,” Gaines said of the agency, adding that the union plans to file a complaint on this matter as part of a bigger grievance package.\n\nThe department did not return a request for comment.",

        "title": "What John Roberts learned during his formative year as a Supreme Court clerk",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nChief Justice John Roberts first arrived at the Supreme Court in 1980, as a law clerk to then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist, for what would be a formative year in his judicial calling.\n\nThe two men were destined for a position that only 17 jurists in American history have held. Rehnquist became chief justice in 1986, and Roberts succeeded him when he died in 2005.\n\nAs the now-public papers in Rehnquist’s archive demonstrate, Roberts witnessed his mentor moving strategically behind the scenes. Rehnquist weakened liberal precedents where he could and planted seeds for today’s conservatism. Coincidentally, some of the cases at the high court today have parallels from Roberts’ time as a clerk, including on the scope of presidential power, the conditions of federal-state programs and unlawful discrimination.\n\nRoberts, now about to notch 20 years at the helm of the federal judiciary, also moves tactically. He often takes incremental steps, with an eye to the next cases coming. That was his pattern, for example, as he cut back on voting rights and federal regulatory power.\n\nHe readily drops references to cases from his clerk year into opinions, as he did last year in the ground-breaking Donald Trump presidential immunity case and most recently last week in a case regarding attorneys’ fees in civil rights cases.\n\nToday, with a conservative dominance that Rehnquist might not ever have imagined, Roberts is the leader of a 6-3 right-wing majority that has been reshaping American life. Roberts also is facing a new challenge in Trump’s return to the White House and the litigation his aggressive effort to overhaul the government has generated.\n\nBack in 1980, Rehnquist represented the far-right pole of the court, and he made it a mission to reverse progressive landmarks of earlier decades. His files at the Hoover Institution on the Stanford University campus attest to Roberts’ close-up view of Rehnquist’s focus and firm ideology and ability to take charge.\n\nOverall, the court – as Roberts first saw it and as he now leads it – negotiates largely through memos and draft opinions circulated among the nine. The justices, appointed for life, deal in a collective courtesy, cloaking criticism in traditional salutations with light asides as they engage in personal arm-twisting or strategize on how to win over a recalcitrant colleague.\n\nDisagreements can be large or small. During Roberts’ year as a law clerk, Justice Harry Blackmun, a stickler on grammar, protested “commute” as a noun in an opinion William Brennan was writing. (Brennan, producing modern dictionaries, urged him to drop it. “Am I stubborn!” Blackmun wrote back, continuing the debate – but not winning it.)\n\nThe justices tussled over potentially offensive language, although their era was far from that of today’s sensitivities. Blackmun and Chief Justice Warren Burger debated whether it would be appropriate to use phrases such as “Russian Roulette” or “Mexican Standoff.” (Blackmun considered them slurs, Burger did not.)\n\nIn a related vein, and without question a slur, Rehnquist ended one private note to Burger, as they were negotiating among justices, with “As the hypothetical Japanese is supposed to have said in a not too current ‘ethnic’ joke, ‘Rots o’ Ruck!’”\n\nRoberts today downplays conflict among the nine. And as a young law clerk, he was ready to put a gloss on internal tensions, as seen in a note found in a separate archive, the Harvard collection of US Appellate Judge Henry Friendly, for whom he had clerked before Rehnquist.\n\nRoberts happened to begin his Supreme Court service a year after publication of “The Brethren,” a book by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong fueled by private interviews with clerks and justices.\n\n“Nothing that I have witnessed suggests that there will be any lessening of the divisions on the Court this term,” Roberts wrote to Friendly in 1980. “But I was pleased to see that the rumors of personal animosity and pettiness circulating in the wake of The Brethren do not seem to have any substance. The Justice (Rehnquist) is at once amiable and challenging and very open with me and my two co-clerks.”\n\nThis photo shows a handwritten note from John Roberts to William Rehnquist. Joan Biskupic/CNN\n\nWoman’s rights milestone case that still resonates today\n\nNot all Supreme Court justices arrange to make their papers available to the public upon their death, and those who do often restrict when materials may be opened, tied to the lives of the colleagues with whom they served.\n\nAfter the deaths of Justices John Paul Stevens, in 2019, and Sandra Day O’Connor, in 2023, the most recent batches, including Roberts’ clerkship year, were opened at the Hoover Institution.\n\nIn the archival materials related to his service for Rehnquist, Roberts and his co-clerks remain largely a background presence. Their memos straightforwardly lay out points of law from their research. Roberts addressed Rehnquist by his initials, “WHR,” and signed his notes simply “John.”\n\nYet, it is plain Rehnquist revealed his strategic calculations to his clerks, including as he tried to diminish the force of a case considered a woman’s rights milestone. In the internal correspondence, Rehnquist called the 1976 case of Craig v. Boren “one of the silliest cases this Court has ever decided.”\n\nThat precedent, it just so happens, remains a point of contention in a pending dispute this session over state bans on transgender youth medical care.\n\nThe 1976 case – which Ruth Bader Ginsburg an American Civil Liberties Union women’s rights advocate and future justice, helped develop – centered on an Oklahoma law that allowed 18-year-old girls to drink 3.2% beer but required boys to wait until age 21. The court struck down that law as violating the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection. The ruling became one of a series of decisions in the 1970s that enhanced protections for women despite originating with disputes brought by men.\n\nRehnquist and Burger had been the only dissenters to Craig v. Boren, and in the fall of 1980, Rehnquist was looking to scale it back in a related case. Rehnquist had a tentative 5-4 majority to uphold a California statutory rape law that criminalized underaged sex for young men but not young women. He wanted it to appear that he was abiding by the reasoning of Craig v. Boren but, in truth, would try to undermine it.\n\n“As you can see,” Rehnquist wrote to one of Roberts’ co-clerks, “we have the narrowest of majorities to support an opinion affirming the Supreme Court of California in this case. I would like to see it drafted as to give nominal obeisance to Craig v. Boren, while undercutting the reasoning of that case as much as possible.\n\n“Craig is one of the silliest cases this Court has ever decided, but both Blackmun and (Lewis) Powell mentioned it in their Conference discussion, so that we cannot simply ignore it,” Rehnquist wrote in the new case called Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County.\n\nWhen Rehnquist’s draft opinion was sent to colleagues a few weeks later, Blackmun saw immediately that Rehnquist was diluting the protection of Craig v. Boren for people claiming sex discrimination. Blackmun wrote him a note saying he wanted to uphold the California law, which the state argued would deter teen pregnancies, but he was concerned that Rehnquist’s draft failed to “follow the analysis of Craig v. Boren” and instead “substituted a lower level of scrutiny” for laws discriminating based on sex.\n\nIn the end, Blackmun declined to sign onto Rehnquist’s reasoning, even as he provided the fifth vote for the bottom-line judgment permitting the California law.\n\nACLU lawyers currently challenging a Tennessee ban on hormones, puberty-blockers and other gender affirming care for youths under age 18 referred to Craig v. Boren as they argued the law fails to meet constitutional standards.\n\n“The Court has been particularly vigilant in applying heightened scrutiny to protect people who fail to conform to overbroad generalizations about the way men and women are – or how they should be,” they wrote in a brief.\n\nIt is important to note that Rehnquist, for his part, came around to that majority view in his later years. The challengers in the pending trans care case cited a 2003 opinion by then-Chief Justice Rehnquist for the proposition that a “long, extensive, and misguided history ultimately prompted (this Court) to hold that measures that differentiate on the basis of gender warrant heightened scrutiny.”\n\nRehnquist's notes to a clerk in Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County. Joan Biskupic/CNN\n\nNotes from Blackmun about Rehnquist’s approach to Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County. Joan Biskupic/CNN\n\nPennhurst and protections for the mentally disabled\n\nThe similarities between Rehnquist and Roberts run deep, including their Upper Midwestern roots and first-in-the-class confidence. Roberts spent his youth in Indiana and earned his law degree at Harvard. Rehnquist, a Wisconsin native and Stanford Law graduate, had himself earned a coveted clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson in the early 1950s.\n\nBoth also worked as top executive branch lawyers. After his clerkship Roberts went into the Ronald Reagan and then George H.W. Bush administrations. Rehnquist had served in the Richard Nixon administration before his court appointment.\n\nAs a top Justice Department lawyer, Rehnquist proved himself an ardent defender of executive power and law enforcement, often seeking to limit individual rights. He continued the pattern on the bench.\n\nIn the 1980-81 session he took the lead for a majority in a difficult case involving institutional treatment of the developmentally disabled, or “warehousing” as critics called it. The controversy led to a ruling that would be invoked through the years, including by Roberts, in disputes over federal-state social services.\n\nAt issue for Rehnquist and his colleagues in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman was a 1975 federal law that helped finance state care of the mentally ill. The question was whether the law’s “bill of rights” required states to provide a certain level of treatment and residential care.\n\nLower court judges had declared conditions at a 1,200-patient institution in Pennsylvania inhumane and dangerous and said Pennhurst had violated the law’s requirement that patients be placed in the least restrictive environment, including community-based housing.\n\nRehnquist believed the law held no such rights for patients. His approach, as he sketched it in a memo, particularly distressed Thurgood Marshall, the court’s first Black justice.\n\n“None of the memoranda as yet circulated in this case is entirely satisfactory to me,” Marshall wrote. “The position taken by Bill Rehnquist is the most untenable: that Congress’s deliberate effort to do something was merely hortatory” for states receiving federal funds.\n\nMarshall also wrote of the Pennhurst State Hospital: “No one involved in this litigation disputes that the conditions at Pennhurst are abysmal. Nor does anyone dispute that Congress had in mind Pennhurst and other institutions like it when it enacted the ‘bill of rights,’ section ….”\n\nAfter two pages of criticisms, Marshall wrote, “Well, there it is!” and “Sincerely, T.M.”\n\nRehnquist prevailed with a majority, finding that the 1975 law did not impose a new obligation for states on patient care. “The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract,’” he wrote. “… Accordingly, if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.”\n\nMarshall joined a dissenting statement that insisted the law’s “bill of rights” provision “cannot be treated as only wishful thinking on the part of Congress, or as playing some fanciful role in the implementation of the Act. The section clearly states rights which the developmentally disabled are to be provided.”\n\nMore than 30 years later, Roberts relied on Rehnquist’s Pennhurst decision for part of his 2012 landmark opinion saving the Affordable Care Act. He voted to uphold an individual insurance mandate but strike down the portion of the law that would have forced states to accept an expanded Medicaid program as a condition of federal funding.\n\nRoberts cited Rehnquist’s 1981 Pennhurst opinion for several propositions, including that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.”\n\nIran hostage crisis\n\nOne of the most significant cases that Rehnquist handled during Roberts’ year arose from the Iranian hostage crisis and the deal President Jimmy Carter made at the end of his term to win release of the 52 Americans held at the US embassy in Tehran.\n\nThe deal to free the Americans held for more than a year called for the release of more than $2 billion in Iranian assets that had been frozen when the embassy was seized. The engineering company Dames & Moore, which had earlier won a $3.8 million judgment against Iran, sued the US government when that judgment was voided as part of Carter’s plan to discharge Iranian assets.\n\nThe justices heard the case on an extremely quick schedule as they were ending their regular session. After oral arguments on June 24, 1981, Chief Justice Burger wrote the justices: “To ‘get the show on the road’ Bill Rehnquist has agreed to get an opinion in our hands by noon Sunday, next – if not before.”\n\nRehnquist was a reliable lieutenant for Burger in pulling together decisions for the court. He was quick, well-organized and more affable with his colleagues than the prickly Burger, who was appointed chief by Nixon in 1969.\n\nIn about a week, Rehnquist pulled together a majority opinion endorsing the president’s authority to settle financial claims against a foreign government and order the transfer of assets.\n\nRehnquist emphasized that the decision was narrow, quoting the justice for whom he had clerked, Robert Jackson, who said the justices “decide difficult cases presented to us by virtue of our commissions, not our competence.”\n\nMore than four decades later, Roberts referred to Rehnquist’s opinion in Dames & Moore v. Regan as he wrote the opinion for a very different test of presidential power. When the court granted Trump substantial immunity from criminal prosecution, Roberts wrote in the July 1 decision that few prior cases could guide the court. “That is because proceedings directly involving a President have been uncommon in our Nation, and,” Roberts said, citing Dames & Moore, “‘decisions of the Court in this area’ have accordingly been ‘rare’ and ‘episodic.’”\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote for dissenting justices in the Trump case also plucked a line from Dames & Moore to chide Roberts for his sweeping decision on presidential immunity: “When forced to wade into thorny separation-of-powers disputes, this Court’s usual practice is to ‘confine the opinion only to the very questions necessary to decision of the case.’”\n\nBack in 1981, Rehnquist’s colleagues flooded him with admiring notes, some referring to the help from his law clerks. “Dear Bill: I join in thanking and congratulating you – and your Chambers – on a super accomplishment, both in time and quality,” Powell wrote.\n\nBurger took a frothier approach, telling Rehnquist, “I will place ten Brownie Points in your personnel file and grant you two weekends leave.”\n\nWilliam Rehnquist’s notes in Dames & Moore v. Regan. Joan Biskupic/CNN\n\nWilliam Rehnquist’s notes in Dames & Moore v. Regan. Joan Biskupic/CNN\n\nJudicial pay\n\nThen, as now, the justices were concerned with leaks, ethics and how they were viewed in the press. A judicial pay case resolved in 1980 especially provoked their concerns about how they were viewed, as Rehnquist wrote, by the “fabled ‘man in the street.’”\n\nWhen the justices subsequently faced the question of whether the lawyers who handled the pay litigation for federal judges deserved enhanced fees, Brennan warned, “the media would have a field day.”\n\nAnd Justice John Paul Stevens scoffed at the suggestion “that counsel should be given special credit for handling unpopular litigation. … There are quite a few lawyers who would have regarded the opportunity to represent the Federal Judiciary as a privilege. It surely is not quite like a march on Selma.”\n\nBurger wrote that opinion providing higher pay to federal judges, finding that when Congress blocked cost-of-living increases it violated the Constitution’s guarantee of no diminishment in their set compensation.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How Amy Coney Barrett broke away from Chief Justice Roberts on Trump immunity ruling 04:58 - Source: CNN How Amy Coney Barrett broke away from Chief Justice Roberts on Trump immunity ruling 04:58\n\nTwo days after the December 15, 1980, decision in the case of United States v. Will, Burger floated a proposal that would specifically benefit the nine justices.\n\nThe memo was marked “CONFIDENTIAL” at the top: “I am informed that the mechanics of the Administrative Office make it impossible to give Federal judges the benefit of the Will decision before December 30.”\n\nBut, he said, the justices’ salary checks “are independently drawn and absent dissent, the amounts due … will be delivered during this calendar year, provided we order the mandate to issue (immediately). I see no reason why this should not be done but I await any comments.”\n\nThe other justices were instantly against the idea of such special, quick action for themselves, and Burger was quickly outnumbered.\n\nRehnquist noted that they’d already “drawn press attention” with the decision that raised their pay and that speeding up the increase for their nine paychecks would “add more fuel” to the fire.\n\nNearly 25 years later, when Roberts appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee after being tapped for elevation by President George W. Bush from a US appellate court, Roberts said he had been inspired by Rehnquist’s “dedication to duty” and “humility.”\n\nHe also remarked on his former boss’s desire to cut to the chase.\n\n“I do remember doing a draft for him once, and coming in, and he had thought that the first topic sentence of each paragraph was good, and the rest of it could be junked,” Roberts recalled. “I pushed back a little bit … and he said at that point, ‘Well, I’ll tell you what. Why don’t we put all this other stuff down in footnotes? We’ll just keep sort of the first sentence of each paragraph, put the rest down in footnotes.’\n\n“And I figured, well, that was a fair compromise. So I would go back and rework it, and hand it to him with some pride. He looks at it and he says, ‘Well, all right. Now take out the footnotes.’”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump just took the biggest gamble of his young second presidency.\n\nHis hammer-blow 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico that hit at midnight dealt a fresh shock to an economy showing alarming signs of slowing growth and rising inflation – a perilous mix for any president.\n\nTrump also doubled an additional tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%, in a trio of decisions that sent stocks – a cherished metric of his own performance – tumbling. The timing was inauspicious, before Trump makes a joint address to Congress Tuesday evening that will be watched by a nation nervous about stubbornly high housing and grocery prices. But to the narrower audience of his most faithful supporters, who show no sign of peeling away, Trump is likely to bill his new trade wars as proof of resolve and commitment to his populist promises.\n\nTrump’s decision to press the button, after previously delaying the duties on US neighbors a month ago, reflects a duel between his political heart and his head.\n\nThe often-volatile president has seen tariffs as an almost supernatural economic tool since his deals as a real estate mogul in the rip-roaring 1980s. Alongside immigration, the conceit that foreign nations are constantly ripping America off forms the foundation of his political career.\n\n“It’s going to be very costly for people to take advantage of this country. They can’t come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished,” Trump said Monday. “And they’re being punished by tariffs. It’s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form.”\n\nMarkets react badly to Trump’s moves\n\nUntil the final hours of Monday, investors hoped Trump would take an off ramp. Earlier, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNN that Mexico and Canada had done a “nice job” on limiting illegal border crossings into the United States but needed to do more to halt the flow of fentanyl – raising expectations of another possible tariff pause, as happened a month ago after both nations strengthened border security.\n\nBut Trump’s announcement that there was no time left for Canada and Mexico to act sent stocks on a late-afternoon plunge, with the Dow down 650 points or 1.48% at the close and with the S&P off 1.76% in its biggest single-day decline of the year.\n\n“The market was expecting something to happen that would mean that the tariffs wouldn’t be implemented … it comes on top of a strong whiff of stagflation – meaning lower growth and high inflation that has been apparent in a number of data releases and as we know tariffs will just accentuate the smell of stagflation,” Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens College, Cambridge, told Richard Quest on CNN International.\n\nTrump’s decision to launch full scale trade wars with America’s neighbors is a landmark moment in his second term and is just the latest occasion when he’s stuck to his sweeping campaign trail promises despite the enormous disruption that honoring his word entails.\n\nAnd it’s a reminder of the ambition underlying his return to the White House – and to what he considers unfinished business. If the tariffs endure, they will underscore his determination to follow through on goals he was talked out of in his first term by establishment political aides.\n\nNow, he’s trying to remake the world on multiple fronts.\n\nBefore escalating his effort to overturn the world free trade system and decades of globalization, Trump cast doubt on US security guarantees that underwrote the transatlantic alliance since World War II. And his effort to gut US federal agencies alongside Elon Musk is an attempt to obliterate the domestic governing order and career civil service that prevailed through many presidencies of both parties.\n\nTrump’s faith in tariffs survives every warning by economic analysts that consumers rather than rival trade powers will pay for them.\n\nTariffs – a device used for generations earlier in America’s history but that was largely phased out in the 20th century – are stamped in the DNA of Trump’s “America First” movement. Their implementation against Canada mirrors the worldview behind his eruption at Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. For Trump, all foreign policy is a monetary transaction in which the United States is either winning or being taken advantage of. This mindset precludes the idea that America has friends or allies with common interests. Instead, his use of tariffs to try to wring concessions from Mexico and Canada on immigration shows that his White House views them not as an exclusively economic tool but as part of a deeper national security arsenal.\n\nCanadian fury\n\nTrump’s turn against neighbors – with whom he clinched an updated North American trade deal in his first term – has fractured bonds that run deep.\n\nIt threatens to pitch Canada, long a faithful friend and half of one of the world’s most profitable trading relationships, into a recession and to cause steep job losses. This, as well as Trump’s suggestions that the Great White North become the 51st state triggered fury north of the border and widespread boycotts of US goods.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback ‘They go into effect tomorrow’: Hear President Trump’s tariff announcement 00:52 - Source: CNN ‘They go into effect tomorrow’: Hear President Trump’s tariff announcement 00:52\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly promised Monday that the Ottawa government was “ready” with $155 billion worth of tariffs on US goods – including a first tranche worth $30 billion. Mexico is also vowing to respond, raising the prospect of prolonged economic warfare unless Trump steps back – perhaps with a concocted claim of victory before the new tariffs have had time to seriously damage the regional economy.\n\nTrump has placed himself in a political box. If he imposes tariffs, he’s playing with fire. If he doesn’t, everyone will think he’s always bluffing, and he’ll dent his own economic leverage.\n\nEven if he relents, Trump’s constant threats are darkening an unsettled environment for investors and consumers.\n\nFor all its legendary resilience, the US economy is flashing weakness. Consumer confidence is tumbling along with consumer spending. The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model on Monday projected a 2.8% decline in growth for the current quarter.\n\nSo, Trump – who is also promising reciprocal tariffs on most global imports next month –could be playing with economic fire.\n\nThe risk is especially acute since voter frustration with high housing and grocery prices helped elevate him to victory in last year’s election. Failing to fix those problems – or exacerbating them with tariffs on lumber and agricultural goods – could cause a backlash, especially for Republican lawmakers in next year’s midterm elections. In a CNN/SSRS poll published Sunday, 52% of respondents said that Trump had not paid sufficient attention to the country’s most important problems.\n\nTrump is testing a lifelong belief\n\nTrump’s rationale for wielding tariffs is that decades of free trade policies and steps like bringing China into the World Trade Organization hollowed out US manufacturing and sent millions of US blue collar jobs abroad. He’s not wrong – although those policies also raised US living standards with a flood of lower priced imports. And Trump believes that re-erecting trade barriers will bring those jobs and factories back.\n\n“As an example, North Carolina … I used to go there to buy furniture for hotels, and it’s been wiped out. That business all went to other countries. And now, it’s going to come back into North Carolina,” the president said on Monday. To drive home his point, he appeared in the White House Monday with the CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, who pledged to pour $100 billion into chip manufacturing in the United States.\n\nBut with less than four years left in Trump’s term, will businesses undertake the expense and disruption of locating plants from lower wage economies abroad? And even if they do, the higher costs of labor, materials and transport in a developed economy could mean higher prices in stores.\n\nDemocrats, who’ve struggled to respond to Trump’s shock and awe, suddenly have an opening.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has sometimes advocated tariffs as part of a wider economic strategy, warned that the prospect of inflation would dampen Trump’s address on Tuesday. “Notice the fix this puts him in,” the Democrat told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on the inaugural edition of her new show “The Arena.”\n\n“Remember, he (was) saying on day one he would lower prices for American families, on day one,” Warren said. “After he gets elected, he said he got elected based on grocery prices and his promises – now we’re six weeks in, he’s done nothing to lower prices. And, in fact, it looks like inflation is going up. With these tariffs, we know that costs will go up for families.”\n\n“So, he’s exactly upside down from his promise.”\n\nWarren’s comments highlighted Trump’s gamble. There’s no way that importers can bear the cost of tariffs of 20% or 25% without passing them onto consumers. And when tomatoes, and fruit and gas and alcohol shoots up in price and new cars are suddenly out of reach, his lifelong and untested faith in the magic properties of “beautiful” tariffs could crash headlong into reality.",

        "title": "Why those reports of DOGE using AI have experts worried about ‘massive risk’",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "New York CNN —\n\nElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team is reportedly using artificial intelligence to guide its cost-cutting decisions, a tactic AI experts say could cause security breaches, biased firing choices and cuts of highly qualified, essential government staffers.\n\n“It’s just so complicated and difficult to rely on an AI system for something like this, and it runs a massive risk of violating people’s civil rights,” said David Evan Harris, an AI researcher who previously worked on Meta’s Responsible AI team. “I would go so far as to say that with the current AI systems that we have, it is simply a bad idea to use AI to do something like this.”\n\nMusk has said he’s aiming to rapidly cut at least $1 trillion from the federal budget deficit. But in the process, his work with DOGE has caused uncertainty, chaos and frustration across the government, as he’s gutted entire departments and made confusing demands of federal employees.\n\nSeveral recent media reports citing unnamed sources indicate Musk’s DOGE team is now using AI to help accelerate those cuts.\n\nExperts say this approach reflects the same “cut first, fix later” thinking that Musk brought to his Twitter takeover two years ago, which resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs, spending cuts that caused technical glitches and lawsuits and controversial policies that alienated users and undermined the platform’s core ad business. But the consequences of dismantling government agencies, systems and services could be more widespread and severe than slimming down a tech company.\n\n“It’s a bit different when you have a private company,” John Hatton, staff vice president of policy and programs at the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, told CNN. “You do that in the federal government, and people may die.”\n\nThe moves also come as Musk has tried to establish himself and his startup, xAI, as leaders in the AI industry. It’s not clear whether the company’s technology is being used by DOGE.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk, DOGE and the US Office of Personnel Management did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nReports of AI to downsize the government\n\nIn early February, members of DOGE fed sensitive Department of Education data into AI software accessed through Microsoft’s cloud service to analyze the agency’s programs and spending, two unnamed people familiar with the group’s actions told the Washington Post.\n\nDOGE staffers have also been developing a custom AI chatbot for the US General Services Administration called GSAi, Wired reported last month, citing two people familiar with the project. One of the unnamed sources said the tool could help “analyze huge swaths of contract and procurement data.”\n\nAfter the Office of Personnel Management sent an email to federal workers on February 23 asking them to send five bullet points detailing what they “accomplished last week,” DOGE staffers considered using AI to analyze responses, NBC News reported citing unnamed sources familiar with the plans. The AI system would evaluate the responses and determine which positions were no longer needed, according to the report, which did not specify what AI tool would be used.\n\nMusk said in an X post that AI would not be “needed” to review the responses and that the emails were “basically a check to see if the employee had a pulse.”\n\nWired also reported last month that DOGE operatives had edited Department of Defense-developed software known as AutoRIF, or Automated Reduction in Force, that could be used to automatically rank employees for cuts, citing unnamed sources.\n\nLast week, 21 employees at the United States Digital Services (USDS) — the agency that has evolved into DOGE under the Trump administration — said they were resigning in protest. The group did not mention AI specifically, but said “we will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.” The group addressed its letter to White House chief of staff Susan Wiles and shared it online.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the resignations in a statement saying, “anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,” according to a report by the Associated Press.\n\nIn an X post, Musk called the USDS employees who resigned “Dem political holdovers who refused to return to the office.”\n\nPart of the problem may be that, building an effective and useful AI tool requires a deep understanding of the data being used to train it, which the newly instated DOGE team may not have, according to Amanda Renteria, chief executive of Code for America, a non-profit group that works with governments to build digital tools and increase their technical capabilities.\n\n“You can’t just train (an AI tool) in a system that you don’t know very well,” Renteria told CNN, because the tool’s outputs may not make sense, or the technology could be missing information or context crucial to making the right decision. AI tools can also get things wrong or occasionally make things up – an issue known as “hallucination.” Someone unfamiliar with the data they’re asking the technology to analyze might not catch those mistakes.\n\n“Because government systems are older, oftentimes, you can’t just deploy a new technology on it and expect to get the right results,” she said.\n\nA pedestrian near a General Services Administration (GSA) building in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Feb. 24, 2025. Reports that DOGE is using AI as part of its efforts to reshape the federal government are raising concerns among technology experts. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn their letter, the former USDS employees said they were interviewed by people wearing White House visitor badges who “demonstrated limited technical ability,” and accused DOGE of “mishandling sensitive data, and breaking critical systems.”\n\nAmong the employees working at DOGE are a handful of men in their early 20s and staffers brought over from Musk’s other companies, CNN and others have reported.\n\nThe White House has said Amy Gleason – who has a background in health care and worked at USDS during President Donald Trump’s first term – is the acting administrator of DOGE, although White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Musk oversees the group’s efforts.\n\nOn Monday, Democracy Forward, a left-leaning non-profit policy research organization focused on the US executive branch, said it had submitted a series of Freedom of Information Act requests as part of an investigation into reported AI use by DOGE and the Trump administration. “The American people deserve to know what is going on – including if and how artificial intelligence is being used to reshape the departments and agencies people rely on daily,” Democracy Forward CEO Skye Perryman said in a statement.\n\nAI concerns\n\nMany of the concerns surrounding DOGE’s reported use of AI are similar to those regarding the technology’s use in other settings, including that the technology can replicate the biases that often exist among humans.\n\nSome AI hiring tools have, for instance, been shown to favor White, male applicants over other candidates. Big tech companies have been accused of discrimination because of how their algorithms have delivered job or housing ads. AI-powered facial recognition technology used by police has led to wrongful arrests. And various AI-generated photo tools have taken heat for producing inaccurate or offensive depictions of different races.\n\nIf AI is now being used to determine what roles or projects to eliminate from the government, it could mean cutting crucial staffers or work simply because of what they look like or who they serve, Harris said, adding that women and people of color could be adversely affected.\n\nTake, for example, the idea of using AI to evaluate email responses from federal government employees outlining their weekly accomplishments. Harris said responses from “really talented” federal workers whose first language is not English “may be interpreted by an AI system less favorably than the writing of someone for whom English is a native language.”\n\n“Even if the AI system is not programmed to be biased, it might still favor the idiomatic expressions or the type of language used by certain groups of people over other groups of people,” he said.\n\nWhile the nature of these concerns isn’t new, the potential fallout from using AI to determine mass government cuts could be more serious than in other settings.\n\nMusk has acknowledged that DOGE may make mistakes and that it’s already eliminated crucial efforts, such as Ebola prevention, that he said it would restore. It’s not clear how or if AI was involved in that decision.\n\nAI does offer efficiency-boosting benefits; it can rapidly parse and analyze huge amounts of information. But, if not used carefully, it could also put sensitive government data or people’s personal information at risk, experts say. Without proper protections and limits on who can access the system, data that’s fed to an AI program in a query could unexpectedly surface in responses to separate requests – potentially to people who shouldn’t have access to it.\n\nHarris is particularly worried about DOGE’s handling of personnel records, which he described as being among the “most sensitive types of documents in any organization.”\n\n“The idea that this group of people that has not had time to go through a lot of training about how to handle extremely sensitive documents, all of a sudden will not only have access to personnel records from a wide swath of public agencies, but then be able to use those (records) to make rapid firing decisions, is very concerning,” he said.\n\nAnd Renteria said the consequences of lax data security by the government could be significant.\n\n“If we, as a society, lose the idea that government’s going to take care of your data, at the very least, that really begins to break down people filing taxes, people going to access food assistance,” Renteria said.\n\nBut perhaps the most pressing concern, experts say, is the lack of transparency around DOGE’s reported use of AI. What AI tools are being used? How were they vetted? And are humans overseeing and auditing the results? CNN sent these questions to DOGE and did not receive a response.\n\nJulia Stoyanovich, computer science associate professor and director of the Center for Responsible AI at New York University, said for AI to be effective, users must be clear about their goals for the technology, and adequately test whether the AI system is meeting those needs.\n\n“I’d be really, really curious to hear the DOGE team articulate how they are measuring performance, how they’re measuring correctness of their outcomes,” she said.",

        "title": "What to watch during Trump’s address to Congress",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night will act as an extension – and explanation – of the rapid change he’s unleashed in just 44 days of his new term.\n\nHe will face his biggest audience yet as he pushes for congressional Republicans, who have narrow majorities, to turn his agenda into law – the outcome of which will go a long way toward shaping the success of his presidency.\n\nRepublicans have largely rallied around the president, but there have been early cracks in party unity over some of the administration’s actions to cut government services and Trump’s recent rhetoric toward Ukraine. Late Monday, Trump paused military aid to Ukraine, which may raise concern in some corners of the GOP even as many Republicans have praised Trump for last week’s Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump’s speech is also coming on the same day as his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada are set to go into effect – the promise of which sent stocks tumbling on Monday and raised alarm among some GOP senators about the impact on their states.\n\nThe White House announced Monday evening that “The Renewal of the American Dream” is the theme of the speech.\n\n“Tomorrow night will be big,” Trump wrote Monday on social media. “I will tell it like it is.”\n\nHere is what to watch during Trump’s first address to Congress of his new administration:\n\nHe’ll try to deliver on his campaign pledges – but will there be specifics?\n\nAfter becoming the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote, Trump now faces pressure to deliver on campaign promises, like lowering prices.\n\nHis party has full control of Congress, but given how fast political winds can shift in Washington, Trump’s advisers have made speed their priority in pushing his agenda – targeting the two-year window before the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nTrump himself has taken a lesson from his first term – he’s not waiting for the perfect moment to execute on his promises. Instead, he signs executive orders almost every day, sometimes deciding only in the minutes beforehand which to sign.\n\nOne Trump adviser said a goal of the president’s speech would be connecting his flurry of early moves to the lives of average Americans. Trump will likely address his plan to lower prices, although the specific contours of his speech were still coming together Monday.\n\nExplaining whiplash-inducing changes\n\nSince taking office a second time, Trump has overseen a dramatic reshaping of the federal government, much of it at the hand of the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who has emerged as one of the most visible and influential advisers to Trump, will be in the House chamber for the speech, a White House official told CNN, and will be held up as a leading example of the administration’s swift action to change Washington.\n\nEntire agencies – which in a previous age would be sending their priorities to the White House for inclusion in the speech – have been gutted in the new Trump era. Tens of thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs.\n\nNot all Republicans are fully on board. Some lawmakers been bombarded with constituent phone calls and voters at town halls who are angry at the dramatic cuts to the federal government.\n\nRallying GOP Congress behind his agenda\n\nThe president’s address comes amid disagreement among House and Senate Republicans over how to enact a budget that aims to reduce spending, protect Social Security and make permanent the signature tax cuts from Trump’s first term.\n\nHe is poised to rally Republicans behind his agenda, advisers said, without offering specific guidance for how to achieve it.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who will sit behind Trump’s left shoulder, has proven more than willing to accommodate the president’s whims.\n\n“There is no daylight between the House Republicans and Senate Republicans,” Johnson told CNN. “We all have exactly the same idea and mission and that is to deliver the America First agenda.”\n\nHow much will he speak to foreign affairs?\n\nTrump’s speech will be heavily focused on his domestic agenda, an official told CNN, with Trump previewing his core policy proposals for the next four years.\n\nStill, one of the main areas of interest is how the president uses the global stage to address the wars abroad, specifically between Russia and Ukraine – and how hard a line he takes against Ukraine after pausing aid.\n\nTrump has discarded decades of American foreign policy orthodoxy, forging ahead in pursuit of new deals with countries like Russia – while other allies like Ukraine are left as collateral damage. Foreign ambassadors who customarily attend the address have been scrambling to explain the changes to their capitals.\n\nIt was only a year ago that Biden administration officials tried to get Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s president, to Washington as a guest at the 2024 State of the Union speech (she couldn’t make it, citing scheduling conflicts). Trump’s address comes four days after Trump castigated her husband in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump said a day ahead of the speech that he would address the Ukraine situation.\n\n“Well, I’ll let you know. We’re making a speech, you probably heard about it, tomorrow night, so I’ll let you know tomorrow night,” he said Monday when asked if he thought the mineral deal with Ukraine was dead.\n\nHow Democrats respond\n\nBack in 2020, Trump’s rivals felt emboldened. After his address that year, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be seen on camera ripping up a copy of his speech.\n\nAn open question this year is how Democrats respond in the room. Party leaders are still scrambling to settle on a message and a plan for how to present a counterbalance to Trump, mindful of the drubbing that Democrats took in the November elections.\n\nThe party has tapped freshman Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan to deliver the formal rebuttal, an often thankless task that can still elevate a junior politician’s profile. A former CIA analyst and member of the US House, Slotkin won Michigan last year at the same time that Trump carried the state.\n\nMade-for-TV moments\n\nEver the television showman, Trump has long relied on an element of surprise for his primetime addresses to Congress.\n\nWhile the president’s speechwriting team has been working on multiple drafts, aides said Monday that Trump has spent little time on the address – aside from a few theatrical moments that are intended to resonate with the audience on television and inside the House chamber.\n\nUnlike during Trump’s first term, top adviser Stephen Miller hasn’t taken the lead in crafting this speech, leaving the task to other speechwriters. However, he and Trump’s other senior aides will all be involved in edits heading into Tuesday evening.\n\nTrump is expected to take a victory lap, touting his election win – something he argues delivered him a mandate to enact sweeping change, despite its relatively small margin – as well as lauding what one senior White House official referred to as the “successes and accomplishments” from his first six weeks in office.",

        "content": "CNN\n\nJason Miller, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, said the president plans to “lean into” tariffs during his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.\n\n”I would say that he’s going to lean into it, and he’s going to talk about how increasing tariffs can actually go and close the trade deficits, which January, we saw a record trade deficit, particularly when it comes to countries such as Canada, Mexico, China,” Miller said when asked by CNN’s Audie Cornish if Trump would have to acknowledge his blanket 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that took effect on Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s senior adviser said the president also plans to “level set” with Americans about the state of the country.\n\n“Typically, this would be done after the first year a president is in office. But since President Trump has already served as president before. He’s going to come in, he’s going to level set with the American people about where exactly we are as a country, what’s happened over these past four years, what he’s been able to accomplish over the last four or five weeks. Then what we still have yet to go and accomplish,” Miller said.\n\nMore on the presidential address: Trump will also discuss what will happen next in his agenda, Miller said.\n\n”We have to go and get this tax bill done. I think you’ll hear the president this evening talk about the one big beautiful bill so we can keep taxes low and take it even lower for Americans. Also need to make sure to make these border fixes permanent,” Miller said.\n\nHe continued, “And then also, as we look ahead, really, we got to look to the future and make sure we’re winning things such as the AI war against China, having a Marshall Plan for energy. So, it’s a bit of where we are, what we’ve accomplished and what we’re going to do, both in the short and in the longer term.”\n\nOn the pause in aid to Ukraine, Miller said Trump is being aggressive in his attempts to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to a deal that would stop the war.\n\n“President Trump is the only person, the only person talking about stopping the killing, and sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,” Miller said. “And in this case, I think President Trump is using the 2 by 4 to go and get his point across to President Zelensky, and that is that President Trump wants to stop the killing. Zelensky has got to get back to the table. He has to take this seriously.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s blanket 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, an extraordinary action aimed at bringing America’s top trading partners to heel. But it threatens to weaken the North American economy, including that of the United States, at a time of significant stress for inflation-weary consumers.\n\nTrump also doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%. Those duties sit atop existing tariffs on hundreds of billions in Chinese goods. China and Canada immediately retaliated with tariffs on American goods, threatening to ignite a damaging trade war. Mexico said it would announce retaliator measures Sunday.\n\nThe Trump administration said the tariffs were necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.\n\n“While President Trump gave both Canada and Mexico ample opportunity to curb the dangerous cartel activity and influx of lethal drugs flowing into our country, they have failed to adequately address the situation,” according to a statement released by the White House shortly before the tariffs took effect.\n\nBut the tariffs come at a time when inflation remains stubbornly high. Americans, and the US economy as a whole, are on shakier ground, as evidenced by recent data.\n\nTrump’s tariffs threaten to raise the prices Americans pay for a wide array of goods that are imported from the three nations, which collectively shipped $1.4 trillion worth of goods to the US last year, according to Commerce Department data. That accounts for more than 40% of the value of all goods the US imported last year.\n\nThe only goods that won’t face a 25% tariff from Canada are energy-related items such as crude oil, one of the top goods the US imports from there. Instead, they’ll be subject to a 10% tax.\n\nFresh produce, cars and car parts and electronics, including phones and computers, are among the top goods the US imports from Mexico, Canada and China that will now face tariffs between 20% and 25%.\n\nThe stocks of global carmakers that have plants in Mexico fell sharply on Tuesday morning. Germany’s Volkswagen dropped almost 4% by 5.46 a.m. ET, while Stellantis (STLA) — the maker of Chrysler and Jeep — fell nearly 7%.\n\nChina and Canada hit back. Mexico is next\n\nBeijing retaliated on Tuesday by announcing 15% tariffs on chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton imports from the US, according to a statement from the State Council Tariff Commission. Additionally, a 10% tariff on “sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products,” was also imposed, it said.\n\nSeparately, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it added 15 American companies, including drone maker Skydio, to its export control list, which would bar Chinese companies from exporting dual-use equipment to them.\n\nChina’s retaliatory tariffs followed a “restrained, targeted approach aimed at causing pain to those industries that matter the most to the supporters of the Trump administration,” said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, head of the China Center for the Conference Board. He noted China’s tariffs give it room for negotiations to potentially avoid even more damaging tariffs down the road.\n\nSpeaking at a regular briefing on Tuesday, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, said: “China will fight till the end” if the US “insists on waging a tariff war, trade war or any other kind of war.”\n\n“I want to reiterate that the Chinese people have never feared evil or ghosts, nor have we ever bowed to hegemony or bullying. Pressure, coercion and threats are not the right ways to engage with China. Trying to exert maximum pressure on China is a miscalculation and a mistake,” he added.\n\nChina announced more measures targeting America on Tuesday. These include stopping lumber imports from the United States, suspending the permits of three US companies to export soybeans to the country and an anti-dumping investigation into some imports of American fiber optic products.\n\nPart of Trump’s stated motivation for imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico is to pressure those countries into exerting stricter controls on the flow of fentanyl into the US.\n\nUS law enforcement believes a number of China-based entities supply precursor chemicals, which can be used to make finished fentanyl in labs operated by drug cartels in the US and Mexico.\n\nOn Tuesday, China’s State Council Information Office published a document outlining the steps the government had taken in recent years to control the production and distribution of fentanyl-related substances, according to China’s state news agency Xinhua. Referring to China’s approach to international drug control, Xinhua quoted the document as saying that the country “advocates mutual assistance… and opposes finger-pointing and buck-passing.”\n\nIn Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said hours before the tariffs took effect that Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on C$30 billion ($20.7 billion) of US goods. By March 25, he said Canada would impose an additional C$125 billion ($86.2\n\nbillion) tariff on American goods.\n\n“Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” Trudeau said in a statement.\n\nThe premier of Ontario, Canada’s largest province, has also repeated his earlier threat to cut off energy supply to the US in response to Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy, with a smile on my face. And I’m encouraging every other province to do the same,” Doug Ford told reporters on Monday, adding that eastern US relies on “our energy – they need to fell the pain.”\n\nDespite Trump’s prior claims that exporters pay for tariffs, it’s actually the parties receiving goods from abroad that pay the tariff upfront. Those parties, often businesses, typically then pass on the additional tariff costs to consumers by raising prices. But in some cases, they may opt to, or be forced to, absorb the higher costs.\n\nMexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Tuesday morning that she would announce retaliatory tariffs on American imports into Mexico, as well as non-tariff measures, on Sunday. She said she will probably have a call with Trump on Thursday.\n\n“The unilateral decision made by the United States affects national and foreign companies operating in our country, as well as our people,” she said at a press conference in Mexico City.\n\n“No one benefits from this decision,” she added.\n\nImpact on spending\n\nAlthough America’s economy remains resilient, tariffs come during a time of increasing cracks in the foundation. A Bureau of Economic Analysis report Friday showed consumer spending unexpectedly fell in January, and a recent inflation report showed consumer prices rebounded in January and inflation continues to grow at a stubbornly high pace.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer confidence fell the most to start a year since 2009, and a separate consumer sentiment report last month registered the biggest decline since records began in 1978. That’s a problem because consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of America’s economic activity.\n\nFriday’s jobs report is expected to show growth continues to stagnate. First-time applications for jobless benefits ticked up more than expected last week, and the Trump administration is laying off thousands of federal workers, potentially disrupting local economies. Federal spending has also been curtailed, turning off access to some people’s livelihoods and services.\n\nTrump’s immigration crackdown also threatens homebuilding, agriculture and other key industries.\n\n“Imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico threatens to chill a collaborative effort to strengthen our shared border and risks starting a trade war with America’s closest trading partners,” National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) vice president for global trade policy Tiffany Smith said in a statement Monday.\n\nSmith said NFTC, a trade organization, supports the Trump administration’s goal “to address illicit activity at our borders.” However, they are “deeply concerned” by the new tariffs, which they claim will “raise costs for American businesses and consumers and undermine US economic growth.”\n\nMore to come?\n\nTrump and his administration have suggested that the latest round of tariffs, though significant, are only the beginning.\n\nSteel and aluminum tariffs are set to go into effect March 12. And reciprocal tariffs, dollar-for-dollar tariffs that match what other countries impose on US goods, are expected to go into effect on April 2.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump keeps hinting at more tariffs to come. Last week, Trump signed an executive order to investigate lumber tariffs. Although he has long suggested America doesn’t need Canadian lumber, the tariff threatens to raise the prices of new homes, a key inflation driver for American families.\n\nTrump also hinted Monday that he would impose tariffs on agricultural imports, in an attempt to boost domestic sales. Such tariffs would go into effect on April 2, he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nWhen the Trump administration abruptly terminated ten thousand foreign assistance contracts and grants last week, it ended funding for programs around the world – including those that had been granted waivers by the State Department to continue their lifesaving work.\n\nMillions of people may be affected by the cancelation of the funding, sources said, noting that it exacerbates the impact already felt from the dismantling of USAID and the sweeping foreign aid freeze and stop work orders put in place in late January.\n\nAlthough some had been restored, such as for production of emergency food products at one company following CNN reporting, many remained terminated as of Monday. Those terminated last week included contracts for work providing clean water and shelter, treating infants and children with HIV/AIDS, preventing infectious diseases, and countless other efforts.\n\nThat freeze included an exemption for Secretary of State Marco Rubio to issue waivers for lifesaving services like food and water. However, a USAID official was put on leave after they wrote a memo saying that they were unable to implement the waivers due to actions by Trump administration appointees.\n\nAccording to the administration, the terminations were the result of Rubio and the State Department finishing a review of the frozen foreign assistance.\n\n“You cannot pause a plane in mid-flight, fire the crew, without a catastrophe,” said Atul Gawande, a former head of USAID’s Global Health Bureau. “You can’t terminate just by shutting off … you have to be able to enable a proper transition, or people will be hurt.”\n\nSeveral humanitarian officials described the terminations of the awards as “a bloodbath.” Others said the rollout of the terminations from the State Department and USAID was confusing and unexpected, even to some officials within those agencies. Two sources said termination notices had metadata tying them to DOGE employees who are detailed to the agencies.\n\nThere did not seem to be a pattern in the terminations, over which the Trump administration claimed Rubio had final say. Each termination notice said the award was being terminated for “convenience,” sources said, and some ended by thanking them for being a partner of USAID or the State Department and “God Bless America.”\n\nMany noted that it seemed to be timed in response to a judge’s order compelling the Trump administration to pay nearly $2 billion in unpaid fees to humanitarian organizations and contractors by last Wednesday night. That part of the lawsuit is now before the Supreme Court.\n\nOfficials from half a dozen humanitarian aid organizations said they received termination notices for programs that had received waivers.\n\nThe Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), for example, said last week it “received award termination notices for three of its primary USAID agreements, which had previously received approval to resume limited work under the PEPFAR waiver for lifesaving work from the Department of State.”\n\n“These agreements cover HIV programming in Lesotho, Eswatini, and Tanzania that serves pregnant women, children, and families with HIV,” the organization said in a press release. “These projects are supporting more than 350,000 people on HIV treatment, including nearly 10,000 children and more than 10,000 HIV-positive pregnant women. Terminating these programs will have a devastating impact on the communities EGPAF serves and our work to end AIDS in children, youth, and families.”\n\nAnother humanitarian official, who spoke on background for fear of retribution, said more than 80% of their organization’s foreign assistance awards were terminated, including “more than a dozen that had lifesaving waivers in place.”\n\nThat included work in the Democratic Republic of Congo, they said, meaning that 14,000 internally displaced persons “are at risk of contracting cholera and other waterborne illnesses because we can’t keep delivering the safe drinking water.”\n\n“More than 12,000 will be forced to live in the open and crowded and dangerous collective centers because we can’t deliver the emergency shelter kits we were meant to,” the official said.\n\nAn official from another humanitarian organization said programs that provided seeds to farmers, ones that provided support to malnourished children, and “programs designed to help youth make the choice not to get involved in extremist groups” had all been terminated. They told CNN that about a quarter of the programs that had been terminated were issued waivers.\n\n“What we don’t understand is the Secretary of State made clear that lifesaving programs, especially but not only food assistance programs, he wanted to continue and then many of them have been terminated,” they said.\n\n“We’re really at a loss, and we’re assuming that there’s been some kind of mistake here,” the official said. “We are hoping that they will reverse these decisions, which are going to be very damaging to people.”",

Customs and Border Protection is encountering a record-low number of illegal aliens at the southern border. Thanks to combination of increased enforcement and the threat of deportation, President Trump is delivering on his promise to end illegal immigration. He’ll need more resources from Congress to finish the job and finally secure the border.\"\n\nEPSTEIN: A\n\n\"Promises made, promises kept, the public is strongly behind him on this, and Democracies don't survive too long under the Biden open borders approach,\" Epstein said.\n\nForeign Policy:\n\nBLUEY: B\n\n\"President Trump promised to end the war between Russia and Ukraine in 24 hours. That’s proving to be more difficult, mostly because of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s unrealistic demands,\" Bluey said. \"After Friday’s blowup in the Oval Office, it’s unclear when peace talks will resume. In the Middle East, Trump is hoping to replicate the success of the Abraham Accords negotiated during his first term. Trump set the tone with his ultimatum for Hamas to release hostages, although there are approximately 59 still in captivity. With the first phase of the ceasefire coming to an end, it’ll take more U.S. diplomacy to get a deal done.\"\n\nEPSTEIN: B\n\n\"The Zelenskyy Presser meltdown didn't make anyone look good on the global stage, Epstein said. \"Rule #1: get your act together before you go public. And where are our hostages in Gaza? On the other hand, Trump is playing three-dimensional chess in each theater, where Biden was playing checkers and never made much meaningful progress.\"\n\nCulture wars (DEI, trans issue):\n\nBluey: A+\n\n\"Using his executive powers, President Trump ordered an end to DEI throughout the federal government—and exposed its deep roots across the bureaucracy,\" Bluey told Fox News Digital. \"By eliminating DEI jobs, he’s ensuring that taxpayers no longer subsidize this Marxist idea. He also signed an executive order banning men from women’s sports, an iconic moment with young athletes cheering him on. His confrontation with Maine Gov. Janet Mills over the issue shows he’s serious about enforcing it.\"\n\nEpstein: A\n\n\"The American people never wanted the cultural revolution that the far left was trying to impose on race and gender, the president will have a super majority of public support on this,\" Epstein said.\n\nTRUMP SET TO CONTINUE UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF ACTIONS, ADDRESS CONGRESS IN 7TH WEEK BACK IN OFFICE\n\nDOGE:\n\nBluey: A\n\n\"Elon Musk and the DOGE team are on the hunt to save taxpayers $1 trillion, which would cut the budget deficit in half,\" Bluey told Fox News Digital. \"They’ve already found $65 billion and showcased the results on a public website. But that represents just 6.5% of Musk’s goal, revealing what a daunting task it will be. Fortunately, there’s finally someone in Washington with the guts to cut spending and bring accountability to federal agencies. Musk shows no signs of slowing down, buoyed by recent polls showing support for spending reductions.\"\n\nEpstein: B+\n\n\"Trump, must, will have public support to rid the bureaucracy of all its flab, self dealing and cultural revolutionary ideology,\" Epstein said. \"But they're acting like they are in a breathless race against father time on this, when in fact they have time to make sure they don't cut off important things like cancer research.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEconomy:\n\nBluey: B\n\n\"President Trump acknowledged that inflation will be hard to tame, placing the blame on his predecessor,\" Bluey explained. \"It’s true that the Biden administration’s spending spree got us into this mess. And it doesn’t help that Trump is also facing a bird flu outbreak causing a spike in egg prices. Voters, however, expect Trump to deliver on his promise to help with the cost of living. His efforts to reduce regulatory burdens and provide tax relief are important steps. He’ll need to keep a watchful eye on Americans’ views of their personal finances to measure his success.\"\n\nEpstein: B\n\n\"Biden made a lot of mistakes and did a lot of dumb things, probably the dumbest was back shelving inflation,\" Epstein said. \"For all of the whirlwind, we've seen very little in the way of Trump tackling inflation in the first month.

        "content": "New Mexico authorities launched an investigation into the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, after officials found the couple dead in their Santa Fe home nearly one week ago.\n\nWhile Hackman and Arakawa's bodies were found under what detectives are calling \"suspicious\" circumstances, officials confirmed no external trauma was seen on either Hackman or Arakawa and the case remains open pending autopsy and toxicology results.\n\nDetectives recovered two cellphones, an orange prescription bottle and a 2025 planner while inspecting the residence, according to the search warrant inventory list obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\nFormer FBI investigator Bill Daly explained to Fox News Digital why every piece of evidence will play a crucial role in determining when and how Hackman and his wife died.\n\nGENE HACKMAN DEATH: COMPLETE COVERAGE\n\n\"After receiving the cell phones, investigators can determine when they stopped moving, when they lost communication, which can tell the time of disablement or death,\" Daly said.\n\nDaly noted that investigators are likely looking at \"when the pacemaker signal stopped working\" to get a better indication of Hackman's date of death.\n\nGENE HACKMAN'S DEATH: WHERE INVESTIGATION STANDS, CHALLENGES AHEAD\n\n\"They can do geolocating around the property to see what was pinging around that time, though they won't be able to tell who without a warrant, but can tell what activity there was before and afterward, even if they're not suspecting foul play,\" he said.\n\n\"Toxicology – there could have been some other type of poisoning, possibly food? They'll go through their trash, fridge … this is stuff the police can do in the meantime while gathering evidence. There are a number of possibilities.\"\n\nGENE HACKMAN, WIFE TESTED NEGATIVE FOR CARBON MONOXIDE: SHERIFF\n\nHackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza confirmed at Friday's press conference. Their residence was tested for the colorless, odorless gas and was cleared by the Santa Fe City Fire Department after authorities found no evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning.\n\nMendoza confirmed the last recorded activity on Hackman's pacemaker occurred on Feb. 17. Authorities assumed this was Hackman's last day alive, as the Oscar-winner's body was not discovered for nine more days.\n\nLISTEN: GENE HACKMAN 911 CALL\n\n\"According to the pathologist, I think that is a very good assumption that that was his last day of life,\" Mendoza said during the press conference.\n\nGENE HACKMAN DEAD AT 95: HIS LIFE IN PHOTOS\n\nHackman and Arakawa were found by maintenance workers Jesse Kesler and Roland Lowe Begay. Kesler, who worked as a personal contractor for the couple for 16 years, made the frantic 911 call on Feb. 26.\n\n\"They'll take a look at the surrounding community,\" Daly said of the gated community where Hackman and Arakawa lived. \"They could tell if there was movement in and out of the property after they passed away. There could be some cameras in and around their house to look at just to piece it together.\"\n\nPeter Valentin, certified senior crime scene analyst, questioned if the postmortem interval – which is the amount of time, or length of time, between death and discovery – was the same for Hackman and his wife.\n\nIn a search warrant affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital, officials revealed that Arakawa's body was found decomposed with bloating on her face and mummification in her hands and feet. Hackman was also found to have the same signs of decomposition as his wife.\n\n\"There was something about the way that his wife was described in the bathroom that I think is worth looking into a bit more,\" Valentin said. \"And she was in the bathroom.

        "content": "OTTAWA, Canada — As new tariffs came into effect on Tuesday, analysts say that if Canada's Liberal Party holds onto power, the party can thank President Donald Trump in part for such a reversal of political fortune.\n\nSince Trump's inauguration, Canada's official opposition Conservative Party – once leading the governing Liberals by a wide margin – has seen their popularity in public-opinion polls gradually decline.\n\nAn Ipsos poll released last week found that, for the first time since the Liberals won the last federal election in 2021, they’re ahead of the Conservatives by two points, with 38% popularity compared to the Conservatives at 36%. Six weeks earlier, the Conservatives were leading the Liberals by 26 points. A general election is expected to be called as early as this spring by Trudeau's successor, who will be announced on Sunday.\n\nDarrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Global Public Affairs, told Fox News Digital that he has never seen a party experience such a rapid and dramatic drop during his four-decade career in polling.\n\nWHO IS PIERRE POILIEVRE? CANADA'S CONSERVATIVE LEADER SEEKING TO BECOME NEXT PRIME MINISTER AFTER TRUDEAU EXIT\n\nHe believes the Conservatives' decline is attributable to two factors.\n\nJustin Trudeau, whose personal popularity has plummeted since he became Canada’s 23rd prime minister in 2015, will step down as head of the Canadian government and Liberal Party on March 9; \"And the threat from Trump to use economic force on Canada to bend us to his knee and possibly absorb us as a 51st state,\" explained Bricker, about the president’s planned tariffs against Canada and his repeated references regarding annexation.\n\nThroughout February, Nanos Research found the gap narrowing between the Liberals and Conservatives, who the month before were poised to form a \"super-majority\" government with as many as 240 members of Parliament (MPs) in an expanded 343-seat House of Commons that takes effect after the next general election.\n\n\"That’s completely out the window now,\" said Nik Nanos, founder and chief data scientist of the Canadian polling firm, who also believes Trudeau’s imminent departure and Trump’s rhetoric against Canada have contributed to the Liberals’ bump in the polls.\n\nThe president \"has effectively changed the ballot question from: Is it time for a change? – which was bad news for the Liberals – to who can best deal with Donald Trump, the new existential threat to the Canadian economy?\" offered Nanos.\n\nHe explained that Canadian Conservative Official Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre and his party played a part in the Liberals’ boost by \"showing they were a little out of touch\" in focusing on the Liberal government’s tax on carbon emissions and vowing to remove it while Canadians became increasingly concerned about Trump’s threats.\n\n\"In hindsight, when the Conservatives had a 27-point advantage in our polling, it didn’t have anything to do with Pierre Poilievre being strong or liked, or the Conservatives being brilliant strategists,\" said Nanos. \"It all had to do with dislike of Justin Trudeau and people wanting change and the Conservatives being the agent of change.\"\n\nAccording to the Ipsos poll, 86% percent of 1,000 respondents said that they want a general election \"immediately\" to have a federal government \"with a strong mandate\" to deal with Trump’s tariff threat.\n\nBricker said the Liberals’ lead in the polls, particularly in Canada’s most populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, over the Conservatives could even widen should Mark Carney, the former governor of the central banks of England and Canada and the frontrunner in the Liberal leadership race, succeed Trudeau as prime minister.\n\nINFLUENTIAL LEADER OF CANADA'S ONTARIO PROVINCE SEEKS TRUMP, MUSK MEETING: US 'NEEDS US LIKE WE NEED THEM'\n\nVeteran Canadian pollster Angus Reid said the latest polling by his company found that 51% said Carney and the Liberals were best suited to improve relations with the U.S., including on tariffs, compared to 35% who chose the Conservatives under Poilievre, who is seen by many Canadians as holding a \"Trump-light agenda.\"\n\nFrom south of the border, the president has \"eroded Conservative support because it completely changed the political dynamic in Canada, completely changed what could be considered the most important ballot question that was all about getting rid of some of the baggage from the Trudeau era,\" explained Reid, founder and chair of the Angus Reid Institute.\n\n\"Now it’s one of defending the sovereignty and economy of the country.\"\n\nAnother Angus Reid poll found that with Carney as Liberal leader, his party is virtually tied at 44% with the Conservatives, at 45% on voting intention. In Quebec, a Carney-led Liberal Party enjoys 31% support compared to the Conservatives at 22%.\n\nReid said the annexation and tariffs issue especially resonates with Quebecers more than any other region in Canada.\n\nCarney’s further challenge for Poilievre is that the former \"on paper, looks like a Conservative,\" said Nanos.\n\n\"The guy worked in the banking sector and the private sector, like Goldman Sachs, and chaired, until recently, large enterprises like Bloomberg and Brookfield [Asset Management]. He walks and talks like a Conservative.\"\n\nCarney, an Oxford-educated economist who has never held elected office, is expected to call a snap election should he be chosen as Trudeau’s successor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf the polling numbers continue to rise in favor of the Liberals, they could not only win the national vote in such a contest but form a majority government, added Reid.\n\nCurrently, the Liberals have 153 MPs in the 338-seat House of Commons, which constitutes a minority government.",

Some of the more moderate ideas floated reportedly include carrying egg cartons to highlight costs, carrying protest signs, and coordinating outfits.\n\n\"The part that we all agree on is that this is not business as usual and we would like to find a way — productively — to express our outrage,\" one lawmaker told Axios.\n\nOther Democrats discussed plans to storm out of the chamber if Trump crosses certain rhetorical lines, such as discussing gender-confused youths.\n\nTHEME OF TRUMP’S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS REVEALED\n\nDemocratic leaders reportedly encouraged members in closed-door meetings this week to keep their protests civil, however, with many arguing that major outbursts would only help Trump.\n\n\"There are definitely a lot of constituents that really want Democrats to disrupt and there are constituents who feel like that just plays into his hands,\" another lawmaker told the outlet.\n\nTRUMP SET TO CONTINUE UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF ACTIONS, ADDRESS CONGRESS IN 7TH WEEK BACK IN OFFICE\n\nMore traditional protest plans include the Democratic Women's Caucus encouraging members to wear pink, as well as women with the Congressional Black Caucus discussing plans to wear black.

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump's new tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico took effect at midnight Tuesday morning, increasing the taxes that U.S. importers will pay on certain goods when they enter the country.\n\nEffective Tuesday, U.S. imports from China, the third-largest U.S. trading partner, will be subject to a new 10% tariff on top of the initial 10% tariff he imposed on Chinese goods last month.\n\nTariffs on imported goods from Canada and Mexico – America's two largest bilateral trading partners, according to Census Bureau data – are also set to rise, with 25% tariffs levied on all imports from the two countries. The tariffs include a carve-out for a lower 10% tariff on Canadian oil imports.\n\nPresident Trump was asked on Monday whether there was room left for any room left for Canada or Mexico to make a deal to avoid tariffs and he replied, \"No room left for Mexico or for Canada. No, the tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow.\"\n\nWARREN BUFFETT SAYS TARIFFS ARE AN ECONOMIC 'ACT OF WAR': 'TOOTH FAIRY DOESN'T PAY 'EM'\n\nShortly after taking office in January, Trump announced he would impose tariffs on the three countries and cited the flows of illegal fentanyl shipments across the Mexican and Canadian borders, as well as precursor chemicals for fentanyl shipped from China. He cited authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nWhile the China tariffs were implemented on schedule, the president delayed the Canada and Mexico tariffs for a month after the two countries announced border security measures.\n\n\"Just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico and, as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada. And China also had an additional 10%, so it's 10 plus 10. And it comes in from Canada, and it comes in from Mexico, and that's a very important thing to say,\" Trump said during Monday's press conference.\n\nWHO GETS STUCK WITH THE BILL FOR TARIFFS ON IMPORTED CANADIAN OIL?\n\nU.S. trading partners have already signaled they will retaliate through their own tariffs on American exports, as well as potential non-tariff trade barriers that would be aimed at U.S. firms.\n\nCanada announced that it will impose a 25% tariff on a wide variety of American exports, including machinery, auto parts, apparel products, alcohol and tobacco, sports equipment, plastic products, construction materials, lumber, agricultural products, appliances, furniture, chemicals and more.\n\nIt also plans additional tariffs on other U.S.-made products that are expected to include cars, trucks, buses, electric vehicles (EVs), recreational vehicles, steel and aluminum products, fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, dairy products and more.\n\nCONSUMER CONFIDENCE SLUMPS IN FEBRUARY WITH BIGGEST MONTHLY DROP IN NEARLY 4 YEARS\n\nMexico's government signaled in February that it is planning retaliatory tariffs it would implement if Trump imposed tariffs on Mexico, though it didn't specify those measures at the time. A report by Reuters citing sources familiar with the matter suggested the potential tariffs could range from 5% to 20% on U.S. pork, cheese, produce, and manufactured steel and aluminum.\n\nChina retaliated against the initial tariffs by imposing 15% tariffs on U.S. energy exports, including coal, natural gas and petroleum; as well as 10% tariffs on manufactured goods, including trucks and agricultural machinery, a Brookings Institution analysis noted.\n\nThe newly imposed tariffs are expected to elicit more retaliation from China, as the AP reported that the Chinese government is eyeing tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports and food products as targets.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAn analysis by the Tax Foundation found that the tariffs imposed on imports from China would reduce long-run GDP by 0.1%, while the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods would deal a bigger blow to economic output, reducing GDP by 0.3%. Those figures are before accounting for retaliation by those countries against American products.\n\nThe Tax Foundation's analysis noted that the U.S. imported $292 billion of non-energy products from Canada in 2024, as well as $120 billion in energy products. Imports from Mexico totaled $504 billion last year, while those from China totaled $430 billion plus additional imports shipped using the \"de minimis\" loophole.",

        "content": "After months of anticipation, Meghan Markle’s Netflix series is finally here and receiving lukewarm reviews from several royal experts.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex’s eight-episode lifestyle series, \"With Love, Meghan,\" became available for streaming on March 4. It was originally scheduled to premiere in January but was delayed due to the Los Angeles fires.\n\nSeveral royal experts who watched the series told Fox News Digital that the \"Suits\" alum appears inauthentic on screen as she attempts to take on the role of relatable lifestyle guru.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE ADMITS TO MAKING ‘MISTAKES’ IN LAUNCHING AS EVER LIFESTYLE BRAND\n\n\"This isn’t innovative, it’s backwards,\" said Kinsey Schofield, host of the \"To Di For Daily\" podcast, about Markle’s how-tos. \"The projects themselves aren’t original. It lacks authenticity. It’s aesthetically pleasing but not where the content world is at right now. It’s too controlled. Too glossy. Too produced.\"\n\nBritish broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard said the opening shot is reminiscent of \"Gardeners’ World,\" a longstanding series in the UK that brings \"gardening ideas to life.\" Still, she said that 20 minutes in, the series \"appears mundane and lacks wow factor.\"\n\nWATCH: MEGHAN MARKLE WILL NEVER WIN OVER UK PUBLIC AGAIN, AUTHOR CLAIMS\n\n\"Meghan seems eager to play the altruistic, kind soul, but it is a tad smarmy,\" she claimed. \"My toes are curling… This is so cringey and not fun at all. It feels too staged, and the tips and tricks are far too basic… Meghan comes across as a modern Stepford Wife.\"\n\nAccording to the streaming giant, the show is not about a quest for perfection, but more about finding joy in the little things. As friends stop by a lush Montecito, California, estate, the mother of two shares her tips and tricks on gardening, cooking and hosting, among others.\n\nThe former American actress told People magazine that her series is not a traditional \"stand and stir\" format, where audiences learn step-by-step instructions as they follow along.\n\n\"Meghan seems eager to play the altruistic, kind soul, but it is a tad smarmy. My toes are curling… This is so cringey and not fun at all. It feels too staged, and the tips and tricks are far too basic… Meghan comes across as a modern Stepford Wife.\" — Helena Chard, British broadcaster and photographer\n\n\"It feels as though we’re just spending time together, which is what it ended up being,\" she explained to the outlet. \"I’d make a recipe and say, ‘Everyone try this,’ and there are certain dishes where you just watch everyone flock in. I’d say, ‘We’ve run out of spoons!’ It ended up feeling so communal, and that’s the spirit of the show.\"\n\nIn \"With Love, Meghan,\" there is no mention of the British royal family, a sigh of relief for the royal experts. Markle and her husband, Prince Harry, stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California.\n\nIn the first episode, she shows a picture of her lemon and elderflower wedding cake while she is baking one that also features lemon.\n\nAudiences learn more about Markle’s past life in Canada while she was filming \"Suits,\" as well as the \"joy\" she gets from being a hands-on parent. As she makes skillet pasta, a frittata using farm-fresh eggs and mint tea, she peppers in lines like, \"It’s like the Beyoncé song. ‘COZY,’\" – referring to her pasta dish - and \"Now we’re talking turkey.\"\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are raising their two young children in the wealthy, coastal city of Montecito.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nUK royal correspondent Neil Sean told Fox News Digital he found it difficult to believe that Markle applies her tutorials at home. In the series, she encourages audiences to make a rainbow-shaped fruit arrangement, fun-shaped sandwiches and a balloon arch for a children’s tea party.\n\n\"Do I honestly believe that she does all of this for the invisible children, who are Archie and Lili?\" he questioned. \"The whole point of the show is being relatable… You know it’s not her kitchen because she’s hesitant to look for things and, more importantly, she doesn’t look at home which of course it isn’t.\"\n\n\"The weirdest thing is that even if you liked what she was making, there’s no real direction,\" said Sean. \"… What did Netflix feel they were going to get from this?\"\n\nChard agreed, claiming viewers would be more encouraged to follow along if they were given how-to steps.\n\nSchofield noted that Markle faces fierce competition in the lifestyle space.\n\n\"Netflix wants people 18 to 39,\" she explained. \"They have 70 million monthly users on its most popular tier. Meanwhile, TikTok boasts over 1 billion monthly active users with the majority of TikTok users between 18 and 34. Key demo. TikTok is full of short, raw videos, primarily shot on mobile devices.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\n\"This is Meghan and an entire production crew, in full glam, taking TikTok content or a Pinterest board and expanding it into longer-form content to a demographic that’s developed a shorter attention span thanks to TikTok brain,\" she added.\n\nOne thing audiences will get is a sneak peek at Markle’s upcoming products. The former American actress recently announced on Instagram that her lifestyle brand was renamed to As Ever and has Netflix as a partner.\n\nThere are plenty of fruit preserves spread all around and \"flower sprinkles\" that she uses to decorate her dishes. She also shows how candles can be made with beeswax. In the first episode, Markle, in beekeeping gear, showcases her honey.\n\nThere is always room for a cookbook if she chooses to write one.\n\nSimilar to how Ina Garten tells her viewers \"store bought is fine,\" Markle also notes that you can easily buy what you need to bring her projects to life without emptying your wallet. Still, Schofield was not convinced.\n\n\"I feel like I’m watching the Home Shopping Network,\" she said. \"Meghan just tried to sell me a balloon blower upper and balloon garland. It’s like the cast of ‘Southern Charm’ trying to sell me Spanx on Amazon Live.\"\n\nSean claimed that Markle’s show struggles to make a mark.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"… There’s nothing new in the world of cookery,\" he said. \"Meghan has picked one of the hardest things to try and conquer. But remember, she’s not an influencer in her own words… The standout spot for me would be… it was beautifully shot, well-edited and fast-paced. But if you feel you’ve seen it all before, well then, you’ve already watched Pamela Anderson’s show… Who inspired who?\"\n\nFor Schofield, \"With Love, Meghan\" appears more like \"a PR exercise to change public perception.\"\n\n\"She’s been labeled a bully for the last four years – most recently in the January issue of Vanity Fair,\" said Schofield. \"This show needs to be a success for her professional reputation.\n\n\"[The Duke and Duchess of Sussex] have failed too many times in front of the world. Meghan has only had one commercial success for Netflix. ‘Heart of Invictus’ and ‘Live to Lead’ bombed. ‘Polo,’ not a success. ‘Pearl’ was canceled before it went into production.\"\n\n\"… One thing she says is, ‘The joy of hosting for me is surprising people with moments that let them know I was really thinking of their whole experience from morning to evening.’ This is an example of Meghan trying to tell us she’s not the palace bully,\" Schofield claimed.\n\n\"I think it’s interesting that she speaks to production staff off-camera versus speaking directly to the viewer. I wonder if that is also a strategy to dismiss the ‘dictator in high heels’ stories. ‘Look, I get along with my crew!’\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE BRACES FOR ‘MOMENT OF TRUTH’ WITH NETFLIX SERIES THAT COULD DETERMINE HOLLYWOOD FUTURE: EXPERT\n\nOne thing the experts do agree on is that viewers, fans or not, will be tuning in. Whether Markle does become a successful lifestyle influencer remains to be seen.\n\n\"Meghan believes there will be a second series because she’s garnered so much worldwide interest so far,\" claimed Sean. \"Netflix is waiting to see the final returns.\"\n\nSchofield claimed \"Meghan hasn’t paid her dues in this [lifestyle] space,\" at least not yet.\n\n\"She’s not Martha Stewart,\" said Schofield. She compliments herself constantly. Meghan Markle’s biggest fan is Meghan Markle.\n\n\"If you like Meghan Markle… you will appreciate this access to her. If you dislike Meghan Markle… this will not change your opinion.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Children whose families have implemented vegan diets in their homes have been seeking playdates with children of meat-eaters so they can try food they can't get at home, according to a recent article in The Daily Mail.\n\nA mother told the publication that it's \"insane\" watching children with restricted diets come to her house and \"never stop eating\" the forbidden foods.\n\nShe said these children aren't interested in vegan food when they come to visit.\n\nMEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'\n\nKelly Springer, a mother and registered dietitian in Skaneateles, New York, told Fox News Digital that a child between the ages of 4 and 8 needs about 19 grams of protein per day — but that number more than doubles between the ages of 9 to 13 and increases again from ages 14 to 18.\n\nDepending on the children's ages and how active they are, \"they may even need more protein,\" she said.\n\n\"And the reason it's important to have these conversations is that animal protein contains all nine essential amino acids, which means it's a complete protein.\"\n\nThe problem with plant protein, Springer said, is that \"most plant protein isn't complete on its own. So, it needs to be paired together.\"\n\nIS PROTEIN MAKING YOU FAT? HEALTH EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON TODAY'S FOOD FOCUS\n\nCourtney Cantrell, a Boca Raton, Florida, psychologist who specializes in child and adolescent therapy, told Fox News Digital that restricting a certain food \"does sometimes become something that is so desirable\" that a child might be inclined to seek it out simply because it's \"taboo.\"\n\n\"Could there be a greater level of inclination to want to consume that because their peers are doing so? Absolutely,\" Cantrell said.\n\nAnother reason kids on vegan diets might want to sneak meat is because they're lacking proper nutrition, Springer said.\n\nA child on a true vegan diet, Springer said, \"could be lacking in several vitamins and minerals, and this is because the animal is going to give us zinc, vitamin B-12, calcium and, potentially, vitamin D.\"\n\n'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP — HERE'S WHY'\n\nThese nutrients are \"very important\" for the immune system, Springer said.\n\n\"Deficiencies – or some deficiencies – are very, very likely with a vegan diet,\" she added.\n\n‘A lot of misinformation’\n\nLauren Manaker, a mother and registered dietitian in Charleston, South Carolina, said she doesn't believe children who are sneaking meat into their diets are doing it because of any nutritional deficiencies.\n\nManaker told Fox News Digital there \"certainly can be some advantages\" for children on vegan diets, with some caveats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"If a child is eating a vegan diet, but they're eating a lot of the plant-based options that are ultra-processed, they may not reap the same benefits as a child [who is] eating minimally processed, meat-free foods,\" Manaker said.\n\nIf she were to encounter a similar situation at her home with one of her children's friends wanting meat, Springer said she'd \"love to be able to\" provide it, \"especially if it's a part of our dinner.\"\n\nBut, Springer said, she'd also want to know if there was a certain religious reason that the child wasn't allowed to consume meat.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of misinformation out there about animal protein,\" Springer said.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\nShe believes it's important to educate parents about these misconceptions.\n\n\"I think the misinformation comes in the way of leading to heart disease and other diseases, cancers and things like that,\" Springer said.\n\n\"Children can follow a vegan diet safely\" with some caveats, said one expert.\n\n\"Yes, we do have some deli meats and, potentially, pepperonis that have nitrates that could potentially be carcinogens. But we also have extremely beneficial proteins like eggs and fish and lean chicken that are helping to heal our bodies and give us what we need.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nManaker added, \"Children can follow a vegan diet safely\" as long as the parents are aware there could be \"some nutritional gaps\" that can be remedied with \"proper supplementation.\"",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "The \"power\" and \"public image\" of disgraced Utah parenting blogger and mom of six Ruby Franke, who is facing up to 30 years in prison for child abuse, allowed her crimes against her children to go \"unchecked,\" according to a criminal defense attorney.\n\nFranke, 43, and Jodi Hildebrandt, a 55-year-old mother of two, ran a joint parenting and lifestyle YouTube channel called ConneXions Classrooms before they were arrested and pleaded guilty to four of six counts of second-degree aggravated child abuse in a St. George courtroom in December 2023.\n\n\"Cases of child abuse are unfortunately familiar, but this one stands out for how power, public image and systemic failures allowed it to go on unchecked,\" Jamie E. Wright, a Los Angeles millennial trial attorney and founder/CEO of the Wright Law Firm, told Fox News Digital. \"Over the years, Franke built up an online persona as the perfect mom, giving parenting advice to millions. But behind the carefully constructed smiles was a darker truth — a world of starvation, isolation and brutal punishment.\"\n\nWright added that the Franke/Hildebrandt case is \"a sobering reminder that social media can mask dysfunction with a gleaming facade.\"\n\nMOMMY BLOGGER RUBY FRANKE'S HUSBAND SAYS ‘SOME CRAZY S--T’ WENT ON IN ABUSE ACCOMPLICE'S $5.3M FORTRESS\n\nPrior to meeting Hildebrandt, Franke ran a successful parenting video blog, or vlog, on YouTube called 8Passengers, representing herself, her husband and their six children. The vlog was a success, with more than 2 million followers, generating the majority of her family's income for years.\n\nBut the 8Passengers empire came crumbling down once users started to notice Franke's unusual behavior and punishments for her children. The story of Franke's downfall is captured in a new Hulu documentary called \"Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke.\"\n\nYOUTUBE MOMMY BLOGGER RUBY FRANKE, CO-HOST JODI HILDEBRANDT SENTENCED FOR CHILD ABUSE: ‘DARK DELUSION’\n\n\"I want our channel to be a ray of sunshine in a world where people just criticize each other and make each other feel bad,\" Franke said in one early video shown in the documentary. \"We’re here to show that happy families are reality.\"\n\nBut other clips shown in the series are not the happy, edited versions Franke posted to social media. They show another side of the mommy blogger — one that had a short temper when her children or husband did things she didn't like.\n\nUTAH POLICE DISCOVER ‘PANIC ROOM’ INSIDE ABUSIVE MOMMY BLOGGER ACCOMPLICE'S $5.3M DESERT HOME\n\nIn one clip, Franke ordered her eldest son, Chad Franke, to \"fake being happy.\"\n\n\"All of a sudden, it wasn’t enough to just interact with her,\" Franke's husband, Kevin Franke, said in the documentary.\n\nMOMMY BLOGGER RUBY FRANKE ASKED DAUGHTER FOR ONE THING BEFORE ARREST: MEMOIR\n\n\"I had to interact with the camera … and she would pull it out and say, ‘Kevin, this camera is millions of people watching us.’\"\n\nBrannon Patrick, a clinical therapist who briefly worked under Hildebrandt and who is featured in the documentary series, said it was \"fascinating\" to watch Franke go from \"happy\" to \"upset and angry\" in the unedited videos.\n\n\"The reality is, everybody has issues and everybody has struggles, and nobody is perfect, and nobody can be perfect. And so on one hand, we're presenting this ideal thing. On the other hand, the reality is something completely different,\" Patrick said.\n\n\"Immediately when it all blew up, it was crazy. All these anti-Mormon podcasters … were just going off about it and how the church was complicit in it and just the church's teachings about sexuality and those types of things … really became front and center,\" he explained. \"And this triggered those talks … about perfectionism and being fake — acting like you're one way in front of people but when the doors are closed, it's actually quite the opposite.\"\n\nRUBY FRANKE'S HUSBAND DETAILS WIFE'S ‘CRAZY’ RELATIONSHIP WITH CHILD-ABUSE ACCOMPLICE:\n\nChad started to see a change in his mother once large checks started rolling in from her constant content creation. His mother had a shorter circuit and would lash out when her children were not behaving the way she wanted them to behave or responding how she wanted them to respond — particularly while she was recording and trying to portray a certain perfect image of her family.\n\nThe popularity of 8Passengers began to dwindle after Chad admitted nonchalantly in one of the videos she posted to her account that he had been sleeping on a beanbag for seven months as punishment for his behavior, and Franke's followers lashed out. Hildebrandt entered Franke's life after 8Passengers fell apart, and the two pals decided to create ConneXions Classrooms.\n\n\"I think we have a culture of perfectionism and shame in many ways, and … [the Franke case] just illustrated it.\" — Brannon Patrick\n\n\"Jodi just threw fuel on the fire and the fire that was already burning and took it to the extremes,\" Patrick said.\n\nYOUTUBE MOMMY BLOGGERS ARRESTED ON ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE: ‘FINALLY’\n\nConneXions Classrooms sold counseling sessions, packages and retreats ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.\n\nIn one ConneXions Classroom episode, Franke told her viewers, \"If your child comes to you on fire, you don’t pat them on the head and say, ‘It’s OK, I’ll help you.’ No, you beat them, and you kick them, and you hit them with a rod. You cannot put welts on your child’s legs and then lovingly apply gauze and expect healing.\"\n\nPatrick said he would diagnose Hildebrandt with clinical narcissism.\n\n\"She was really lonely.\" — Brannon Patrick\n\n\"I don't use that word lightly because I know it's thrown around way too much,\" he said. \"But she was a narcissist. … She was charming enough to draw people in, but she still, to me, felt very disconnected as a human being. She was very convincing in her speech, but she was disconnected. Her family life wasn't good. She didn't have any really close friends.\"\n\nUTAH CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR SENT DAMNING TEXT TO LOVER BEFORE HUBBY POISON PLOT: DOCS\n\nFOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X\n\nIn 2023, Utah authorities arrested the two pals and business partners for abusing Franke's two youngest children, a 9-year-old girl and 12-year-old boy. Some of the abuse occurred in Hildebrandt's home.\n\nThe allegations against Franke and Hildebrandt only came to light after Franke's son fled Hildebrandt's Ivins home and ran to a neighbor, who called 911 after seeing the malnourished boy with duct tape on his wrists and ankles.\n\n\"Social media helped Ruby Franke build a brand around extreme parenting, which likely made it harder for people to see the red flags,\" trauma therapist Malka Shaw, founder of Kesher Shalom Projects, told Fox News Digital. \"When someone presents as the authority on family values, there’s often a reluctance to question them—even when the content itself is unsettling.\"\n\nHEAR THE 911 CALL:\n\nWright noted that when \"a family’s life becomes abrand, perception triumphs over wellness.\"\n\n\"And thus secrecy thrives, and controltightens,\" she said. \"Ruby’s oldest daughter, Shari, has since spoken out about the damage that was done, joining a growing chorus of former child influencers and reality stars who have recently discussed the dangers of living their lives without protections in the public eye.\"\n\nShari explained in the documentary how her mother's company, 8Passengers LLC, listed Franke's six children as \"employees.\"\n\n\"When children are treated as commodities, they are vulnerable in every way, shape and form — whether living in a suburban home or in Hollywood.\" — Jamie E. Wright, Wright Law Firm\n\nWright said the \"most haunting question of all\" in the Franke-Hildebrandt case is why the abuse was not \"halted sooner.\" Shari Franke has also talked about how she tried for years to get the Department of Family and Child Services to take action against her mother in her memoir.\n\n\"Child protectionagencies are often under-resourced, hesitant to intervene in cases where the accused is a respected member of the community. A good image can be carefully curated, and a cover for an abuser for years,\" Wright explained.\n\nShe added that for many Utah locals, the case was a \"betrayal.\"\n\nSIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Franke wasn’t just another influencer; she was a sort of moral authority,\" Wright said. \"Her fall has sparked a conversation about how child welfare regulations should apply to content creators, and what ethical obligations content creators have to the subjects of their work. How do we protect children in digital media How do we ensure that they’re protected and that their rights and privacy are protected?\"\n\nFranke and Hildebrandt were both sentenced to serve four consecutive terms between a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 60 years in prison.\n\nRuby Franke spoke publicly for the first time at her sentencing hearing last year.\n\n\"For the past four years, I've chosen to follow counsel and guidance that has led me into a dark delusion,\" a teary Franke said in a statement at the time. \"My distorted version of reality went largely unchecked as I would isolate from anyone who challenged me. I was led to believe this world was an evil place, filled with cops who control, hospitals that injure, government agencies that brainwash, church leaders who lie and lust, husbands who refuse to protect, children who need abuse.\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe continued: \"To my babies, my six little chicks, you are part of me,\" she continued. \"I was the momma duck who was consistently waddling you to safety. … In the past four years, I was consistently leading you to danger.\"\n\nThe case has prompted discussions about how parenting and lifestyle blogs often present only a sliver of a person’s or family’s reality, as well as children’s rights to their own privacy if their parent is a social media star.",

        "content": "Vice President JD Vance gave his perspective on the widely-seen spat last week at the White House between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy , saying it all started when his answer to a journalist’s question set the Ukrainian leader \"off.\"\n\n\"I do think that there was just a certain sense of — there was a lack of respect. There was a certain sense of entitlement,\" Vance said Monday in an interview on \"Hannity,\" his first since the dustup.\n\nDuring the meeting in the Oval Office, the former Ohio senator explained the importance of engaging in diplomacy to end Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war when Zelenskyy asked if he could follow up.\n\nPUTIN ‘DOESN’T WANT PEACE,' EU CHIEF DIPLOMAT WARNS AHEAD OF TRUMP, ZELENSKYY DEAL\n\nHe described Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, previous failed peace agreements and a 2019 ceasefire that was violated by the Kremlin.\n\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?\" Zelenskyy asked incredulously.\n\n\"I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance responded. \"I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media…You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\"\n\nHe then chided the Ukrainian leader for being ungrateful for American aid and questioned if he'd even said thank you during their meeting. Zelenskyy has thanked the United States for its support multiple times on his X account and during a December 2022 address to Congress.\n\nVance told Fox News host Sean Hannity Monday that he attempted to defuse the situation, claiming he tried to have the conversation in private.\n\n\"The president was like, nope, actually, I don't want to have it in private anymore. I want to have this actual conversation in public for the American people to see,\" the vice president said.\n\nTrump and Zelenskyy engaged in a tense and unprecedented back and forth where the president claimed the Ukrainian leader was \"gambling with World War III.\"\n\nThe rare earth minerals deal that the two world leaders were supposed to sign fell through after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House.\n\nTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform that his counterpart could come back \"when he is ready for Peace.\"\n\n\"The president has set a very clear goal for his administration. He wants the killing to stop. And I think that it's very important that President Zelenskyy and of course, President Putin, too, they've both got to come to the negotiating table. And that's ultimately where things broke apart,\" Vance explained.\n\n\"I really don't care what President Zelenskyy says about me or anybody else. But he showed a clear unwillingness to engage in the peace process that President Trump has said is the policy of the American people and of their president.\"\n\nWORLD LEADERS BACK ZELENSKYY FOLLOWING TRUMP, VANCE OVAL OFFICE SPAT\n\n\"This thing cannot go on forever,\" he continued. \"There aren't enough Ukrainian lives, there isn't enough American money, and there isn't enough ammunition to fund this thing indefinitely. The only realistic pathway to bring this thing to a settlement is President Trump's pathway. We encourage both President Zelensky and President Putin to follow that path.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nThe real tragedy following last week's meeting with Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy and Vice President Vance, is not just that the Oval Office quarrel derailed a peace effort that might have stopped the killing in the Ukraine-Russia war, but also that so many people are still working hard to keep the war from ending.\n\nWhy? Because they hate President Trump more than they love peace.\n\nThe good news is that the spat between Trump and Ukraine President Zelenskyy has brought European leaders to the table; their increased commitments to defense could bring a proposed peace deal closer.\n\nThat is not how Trump’s critics see it. They blame the president for the rupture, of course.\n\nWILL UKRAINE MINERALS DEAL HAPPEN AFTER ZELENSKYYY FIASCO? TRUMP TO REVEAL IN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\nHoldovers from the Obama and Biden White Houses like former Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, all of whom have criticized Trump’s peace proposal, do not want the president to succeed because a cease-fire deal would highlight their failures. The Obama team allowed Russia to slice off Crimea and invade other regions of Ukraine with zero penalty, emboldening Putin to strike again.\n\nBiden’s group failed to prevent Russia’s 2022 invasion and then never developed a plan to end the war; they never spoke of actually winning. Even that hapless crew knew that Ukraine would never triumph over Russia. At best they hoped for a stalemate; but that modest goal proved elusive, as Ukraine gradually, inevitably, lost territory while President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken congratulated each other on uniting Europe…in defeat.\n\nDemocrats do not want Trump to end the war because they know that shutting down the carnage and the outflow of U.S. money would be wildly popular with voters. Almost certainly, a peace agreement would help the GOP maintain their control of Congress next year.\n\nNever-Trumpers also hate the idea of success, because they bet against a man who defied the odds and won the popular vote last year. Liz Cheney, who posted on X that Trump is \"busy surrendering to a KGB butcher\" doesn’t want a win for Trump; opposing the 45th president cost Cheney her political career. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – a state Trump won by 10 points – claimed the Oval Office brawl made her \"sick to her stomach\"; bucking the president will almost certainly end her career, too.\n\nConnecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy, who claims that the White House is an \"arm of the Kremlin\" would hate to see Trump succeed. He is desperate to become the Next Big Thing in the leaderless Democratic Party, curiously positioning himself as an extreme anti-Trumper, notwithstanding the president’s strong approval ratings.\n\nMurphy and other Democrats met with Zelenskyy ahead of the Oval Office gathering, reportedly coaching him to push back against the proposed deal; they have blood on their hands.\n\nSome blame President Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance for causing the rift. But it is undeniable that the White House team who gathered in the Oval Office did so expecting that Zelenskyy was ready to sign a deal that would lead to a ceasefire with Russia and ultimately to peace. He had signaled agreement earlier in Europe, but had insisted on traveling to the White House to ink the pact.\n\nBut then…Zelenskyy wanted to relitigate the deal, in front of the media. This was not smart.\n\nThe irony is that the blowup in the Oval Office may accomplish a principal ambition of President Trump's: getting Europe to shoulder a greater share of the West’s defense. There has already been progress. NATO reports: \"Over the past decade, European Allies and Canada have steadily increased their collective investment in defence – from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024…\" Recent pronouncements from EU heads of state and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggest that more spending is likely.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nStarmer, who recently met with President Trump, says he thinks the commitment of the U.S. president to peace is \"completely sincere\" but that the minerals deal on its own will not guarantee Ukraine’s security. He has offered increased support and boots on the ground. If France and Germany also step up, a comprehensive, strong agreement could result.\n\nThe proposal from President Trump, which entails the U.S. partnering with Ukraine to exploit that country’s minerals and rare earths, has been described by Treasury Secretary Bessent as an \"elegant\" solution. It would accomplish these objectives:\n\nThe partnership would allow Ukraine’s valuable resources to be developed. Ukraine cannot manage such an undertaking on its own, since it lacks both the money and know-how to do so. The U.S. could provide both. Money from the mining and production of these resources would be available not just to repay the U.S. taxpayer, but also to the repair of Ukraine, which has been shattered by three years of war. American voters will support our continued involvement with Ukraine if they see some dividends; Congress will follow their lead. Large-scale U.S. investment in Ukraine will deter Vladimir Putin from invading the country, knowing Americans will be willing and eager to defend their property. That is the backstop that critics of the deal refuse to acknowledge. However, a European peace-keeping force adds more protections. The arrangement provides U.S. security without putting boots on the ground.\n\nThe proposed scheme has the added advantage of lessening U.S. reliance on China. While Democrats are quick to accuse Trump of policies that favor Putin, few have explained why Joe Biden insisted on energy diktats that clearly deepen our dependence on China. Pushing the U.S. towards electric vehicles or solar panels meant greater imports of critical materials from our number one enemy. Being able to source some of those ingredients from a friendly nation would be a win.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump’s proposal makes sense, but becomes more credible and immediate with the involvement of Europe. The Oval Office brawl could, in the end, lead to peace.\n\nEveryone should be on board.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

        "content": "The European Union has a new plan to spend $840 billion more on its own defense after President Donald Trump paused aid to Ukraine and peace negotiations hit a wall.\n\n\"I do not need to describe the grave nature of the threats that we face, or the devastating consequences that we will have to endure if those threats would come to pass,\" EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nShe said she had written a letter to the heads of state of all European governments outlining a \"set of proposals\" to \"rearm Europe.\"\n\n\"A new era is upon us,\" von der Leyen wrote in the letter.\n\nThe plan details \"how to use all the financial levers at our disposal in order to help member states to quickly and significantly increase expenditures in defense capabilities, urgently now, but also over [a] longer period of time, over this decade.\"\n\nEUROPE MUST LEAD ON UKRAINIAN SECURITY GUARANTEES, GREEK FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS: 'WE ARE THE NEIGHBORS'\n\nCountries in the EU would have access to loans of up to $158 billion for defense investment, according to the proposal. It also calls for relaxing strict debt ceilings agreed to by the bloc for defense spending.\n\n\"This will allow member states to significantly increase their defense expenditures without triggering the excessive deficit procedure,\" she said, referring to the rule that requires nations to bring their deficits down if they breach a certain amount.\n\nThe proposal also involves using the existing EU budget to \"direct more funds towards defense-related investments.\"\n\n\"With this equipment, member states can massively step up their support to Ukraine. So, immediate military equipment for Ukraine,\" she said.\n\nThe new defense plan comes as Washington recalibrates its relationship with Europe, and conservative Republicans push Trump to lead efforts to pull the U.S. out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\nEuropean leaders held an emergency summit over the weekend in London to discuss how to support Ukraine after the Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brought peace negotiations to an abrupt halt.\n\nAt that summit, European leaders discussed ways to keep military aid flowing, increase economic pressure on Russia, and establish a \"coalition of the willing\" of European nations ready to offer forces to act as a safeguard against another invasion by Russia once the two sides reach a peace agreement.\n\nEUROPEAN LEADERS ON EDGE AS PROSPECT LOOMS OF TRUMP PULLING 20K TROOPS FROM CONTINENT\n\n\"This is a moment for Europe, and we are ready to step up,\" said von der Leyen.\n\nEven France’s Marine Le Pen, leader of the conservative National Rally party, called the U.S. action a form of \"brutality.\"\n\n\"I consider the brutality of this decision to be reprehensible,\" she said of the move to pause aid.\n\n\"It is very cruel for Ukrainian soldiers engaged in a patriotic defense of their country,\" she insisted, adding that it was \"very questionable\" not to give the Ukrainians a warning before doing so.\n\nThe temporary pause will apply to all U.S. military aid not yet in Ukraine. It is expected to last until the White House determines that Zelenskyy is committed to peace talks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,\" a White House official said.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden shipped over a $500 million aid package on his way out the door in January, some $3.86 billion from previously approved aid packages remains, a defense official told Fox News Digital, including Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) and anti-tank weapons and thousands of artillery rounds and armored vehicles.",

        "content": "A Republican-led Senate bill to prevent boys from participating in girls' sports failed to overcome the legislative filibuster on Monday night after it did not reach the necessary 60-vote threshold to advance.\n\nThe bill failed to clear the key procedural hurdle by a vote of 51-45, along party lines. All Democratic senators voted against the motion to proceed, with the exception of absent Sens. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and Peter Welch, D-Vt., who were absent.\n\nThe Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act would require Title IX to treat gender as \"recognized based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth,\" and would disallow any adjustment for it to apply to gender identity.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-AL, and has over 40 cosponsors in the Senate. It would also codify one of Trump's many recent executive orders, giving the policy better longevity.\n\nWHO IS ELISSA SLOTKIN, AND WHY DID DEMS CHOOSE HER FOR THE PARTY'S REBUTTAL TO TRUMP SPEECH?\n\nLast month, Trump issued an executive order titled, \"Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports.\"\n\n\"It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women’s sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth,\" it read.\n\nIn a statement shared by Tuberville's office prior to the Monday vote, the White House said, \"The Administration strongly supports passage of S. 9, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025.\"\n\n\"Through an amendment to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, this bill would expressly recognize what is already federal law—that it is an illegal act of discrimination for a man to participate in a federally funded athletic program or activity designated for women or girls,\" the statement said.\n\n\"This bill also recognizes that ‘sex,’ as used in the statutory scheme, is based solely on reproductive biology and genetics,\" it continued. \"Men participating in women’s sports not only is demeaning and dangerous to women and girls, but it erodes the integrity of our Nation’s civil rights laws. Congress’s affirmative vote on this bill would complement both federal court rulings and President Trump’s February 5, 2025, Executive Order, ‘Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports.'\"\n\nTuberville's effort to advance the bill has been years in the making, with the senator first introducing it during President Joe Biden's administration, during which there were no such executive orders.\n\nLike the executive order, the measure would ban federal funding from going toward sports programs that allow biological men to participate in women's and girls' sports.\n\nFLASHBACK: DEM SENATOR EMBROILED IN CONFLICT OF INTEREST ROW TARGETED SCOTUS IN ETHICS CRUSADE\n\n\"Female athletes who work extremely hard should not have their future in athletics hindered because they are forced to compete against biological males. Instead of standing up for women and girls, Democrats voted to cosign Joe Biden’s attempted assault on Title IX,\" said Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., in a statement. \"I will continue working with President Trump and my Republican colleagues to preserve Title IX, ensuring every woman and girl has the chance to succeed.\"\n\nThe bill and executive order come amid growing concerns about biological men and boys who identify as transgender participating in and winning in events and leagues for women and girls.\n\n\"President Trump ran on the issue of saving women’s sports and won in a landslide,\" Tuberville said in a statement to Fox News Digital in January when he reintroduced the bill for the 119th Congress. \"70% of Americans agree—men don’t belong in women’s sports or locker rooms. I have said many times that I think Title IX is one of the best things to come out of Washington. But in the last few years, it has been destroyed.\"\n\n\"While I’m glad that the Biden administration ultimately rescinded the proposed rule, Congress has to ensure this never happens again. I am welcoming my first granddaughter this spring and won’t stop fighting until her rights to fairly compete are protected. I hope every one of my colleagues will join me in standing up for our daughters, nieces, and granddaughters by voting for this critical bill.\"\n\n'UTTER DISASTER': LINDSEY GRAHAM CALLS FOR ZELENSKYY RESIGNATION AFTER WHITE HOUSE THROWDOWN\n\nAt the time, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had signaled his plan to move forward with Tuberville's bill, foreshadowing the early March vote.\n\nThe Senate's consideration of the bill comes as the Democratic Party faces an identity crisis, with many pointing to candidates' unpopular position in favor of transgender participation in women's sports as an example.\n\nSEE THE STAR-STUDDED LIST OF TRUMP ALLIES DESCENDING ON DC TO CHART FURTHER 100-DAY WINS\n\nLast year, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-MA, received backlash from the party after saying in an interview, \"Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,\" he told the New York Times.\n\nSoon after the comments, his campaign manager resigned and Moulton faced protests.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump is set to address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night for the first time in his second term and is expected to deliver a speech to outline his plans for the nation under the theme of \"The Renewal of the American Dream.\"\n\nThe president is scheduled to speak before all members of Congress on Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nTHEME OF TRUMP’S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS REVEALED\n\nThe speech is not officially called the \"State of the Union\" because Trump has not been in office for a full year, though it operates in a similar fashion. The yearly presidential address is intended to showcase the administration's achievements and policies.\n\nThe president has been working at a breakneck pace to align the federal government with his \"Make America Great Again\" policies. The president took more than 200 executive actions on his first day in office on Jan. 20 and has not slowed the pace since.\n\nWhite House officials exclusively told Fox News Digital that the speech , themed \"The Renewal of the American Dream,\" will feature four main sections: accomplishments from Trump's second term thus far at home and abroad; what the Trump administration has done for the economy; the president's renewed push for Congress to pass additional funding for border security; and the president's plans for peace around the globe.\n\nTrump’s joint address \"will be must-see TV,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital.\n\nTRUMP SET TO CONTINUE UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF ACTIONS, ADDRESS CONGRESS IN 7TH WEEK BACK IN OFFICE\n\n\"President Trump has accomplished more in one month than any president in four years, and the renewal of the American Dream is well underway,\" Leavitt said. \"In his joint address to Congress, President Trump will celebrate his extraordinarily successful first month in office while outlining his bold, ambitious and commonsense vision for the future.\"\n\nThe president will review his administration’s \"accomplishments from his extraordinarily successful first month in office, both here at home and abroad,\" White House officials told Fox News Digital.\n\nOfficials said the president will also discuss what his administration has done and continues to do to \"fix the economic mess created by the Biden administration and end inflation for all Americans.\"\n\nThe president is expected to highlight the more than $1.7 trillion in investments made since he took the oath of office to bring manufacturing back to the United States, including increases in energy production, investments in the private sector on AI and more.\n\nAlso in the address, the president will push Congress to pass more border security funding to fund deportations and the continued construction of the border wall along the U.S. southern border.\n\nOn foreign policy, the president is expected to outline his plans \"to restore peace around the world.\" A White House official told Fox News Digital that he will lay out his plans to end the war in Ukraine. He will also focus on the work of his administration to ensure the release of all hostages from Gaza.\n\nThe president posted on his Truth Social account on Monday morning teasing his address, saying, \"Tomorrow night will be big. I will tell it like it is!\"\n\nWhen asked for comment on the president’s post, a White House official told Fox News Digital, \"As always, President Trump will keep it real and speak the truth.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Channel, Fox News Digital and Fox News Go will have live coverage of the event Tuesday evening.\n\nFox News Channel will also preview the speech during its primetime and afternoon programming.",

        "content": "Former NCAA athlete Riley Gaines, Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, and a state-level DOGE official are just some of the faces Americans will get a glimpse of inside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday night.\n\nMembers of Congress spoke with Fox News Digital about their guests for President Donald Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress for his second term.\n\nRep. Marianette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, said she invited Gaines after they both attended a White House event where Trump signed an executive order aimed at limiting transgender athletes' participation in school sports. Girls' sports was a top issue for Miller-Meeks during her close House race in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., told Fox News Digital he would be bringing Ross Ulbricht, founder of the darkweb platform Silk Road.\n\nTUNE IN: LIVE COVERAGE OF TRUMP'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS TUESDAY NIGHT ON FOX NEWS\n\nHis operation of the site, which was known for facilitating the trafficking of firearms and narcotics, saw him get arrested by the FBI and hit with a sentence of double life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n\nUlbricht was pardoned by Trump, who called him a victim of a weaponized government.\n\nIn another nod to the Trump administration's work so far, Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, is attending the speech with the chair of her home state's own DOGE task force.\n\nEmily Schmitt, who works as chief administrative officer and general counsel for Sukup grain manufacturing company, was appointed to the role by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds following Trump's own Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts, led by Elon Musk.\n\nHinson herself is a member of the House DOGE Caucus.\n\nAmong the guests of House GOP Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., are U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame honorees Buzz Schneider and Rob McClanahan. The Minnesota natives were part of the Gold Medal-winning 1980 U.S. Olympic men's hockey team.\n\nTRUMP'S UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF EXECUTIVE ACTION\n\nTheir victory over the Soviet Union that year inspired the sports film, \"Miracle on Ice.\"\n\nGuests invited by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Main Street Caucus Chairman Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., were a nod to Republicans' backing of law enforcement, Fox News Digital learned.\n\nRoy's guest is Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Lt. Chris Olivarez.\n\nJohnson is bringing Meade County Sheriff Pat West, who solved a sex trafficking case involving a 13-year-old girl who was abducted by a 33-year-old male sex offender, the congressman's office said.\n\nThe border also remains a top issue for Republicans, which Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is reflecting by inviting the father of Sarah Root, an Iowa native who was killed by an illegal immigrant. A provision known as \"Sarah's Law\" made it into the Laken Riley Act, the first bill Trump signed when he returned to office.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Democrats are using their guest tickets to message against Trump's policies.\n\nTOP WILDEST MOMENTS FROM PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHES TO CONGRESS\n\nDemocratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mark Warner of Virginia, and Rep. April McClain Delaney of Maryland, are bringing former federal workers who lost their jobs during Trump and Musk's DOGE housecleaning efforts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWarner's office told Fox News Digital the senator was \"bringing a laid-off park ranger from the Fredericksburg national battlefield.\"\n\n\"She is a cancer survivor who now has no health insurance,\" Warner's office said of his guest.\n\nNot all Democrats are following suit, however. Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia is attending with Al Lipphardt, commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), from Stone Mountain.",

        "content": "FIRST ON FOX: The Democratic senator who is being billed as a \"moderate\" and was tapped to give the rebuttal to President Trump’s Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress is still employing a staffer who faced backlash last year for her public support of Minister Louis Farrakhan.\n\nMichigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who will deliver the rebuttal to Trump, employed a deputy political director during her campaign last year who posted on Facebook in 2017 about her \"full week\" of \"supporting the Nation of Islam and the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan\" at the Nation of Islam's \"Saviours' Day Convention.\"\n\nThe staffer, Dr. Terra DeFoe, posted a photo of herself standing next to Farrakhan and wrote, \"Great time with my Brothers at Savior's Day Convention.\"\n\nFarrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, has been vocal about what he thinks of Jews, comparing them to termites and saying they are \"Satanic.\" He has also praised Adolf Hitler as a \"great man\" and has become one of the most controversial religious figures in the United States due to his derogatory comments about Israel.\n\n‘MY SQUAD’: NATIONAL COORDINATOR OF LEFT-WING GROUP ATTENDS NOTORIOUS ANTISEMITE'S ANNUAL GATHERING\n\nIn 2019, two years after DeFoe attended the Nation of Islam convention, she invited Troy Muhammad onto her talk show. Muhammad, who serves as a \"State Representative for Minister Louis Farrakhan and Minister of Muhammad Mosque No. 1\" and was pictured in DeFoe's 2017 Facebook post, was described by DeFoe in the introduction as a \"valued community leader in Detroit.\" The interview, which lasted nine minutes, according to an archived copy , did not include any questions about Farrakhan's controversial antisemitic comments.\n\nAfter the conclusion of Slotkin’s successful Senate campaign, DeFoe was given the position of regional director starting in January 2025, according to Legistorm.\n\nFederal Election Commission records show that DeFoe was paid tens of thousands of dollars from the Slotkin campaign between July 2023 and December 2024, weeks before she was promoted to the regional director position.\n\nPRO-FARRAKHAN PASTOR LEADING TARGET DEI BOYCOTT CALLS BLACK TRUMP SUPPORTERS 'COONS' AND 'RUNAWAY SLAVES'\n\nAfter Fox News Digital exclusively reported on DeFoe’s ties to Farrakhan last May, multiple Jewish activists called for Slotkin's staffer to be fired.\n\n\"StopAntisemitism is dismayed to learn that Representative Elissa Slotkin still employs a Farrakhan supporter who has openly praised one of America’s most notorious antisemites. Farrakhan uses antisemitic slurs, and pushes Jew-hating rhetoric, yet Rep. Slotkin has refused to fire this staffer, despite public outcry,\" Liora Rez, StopAntisemitism's executive director, told Fox News Digital on Monday.\n\n\"How can a Representative who enables this kind of extremism be considered a moderate? Rep. Slotkin’s silence needs to be addressed,\" she continued. \"If she won’t take a stand against antisemitism within her own team, why should her constituents trust her to stand up for American values at all?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTudor Dixon, who ran for governor of Michigan as a Republican in 2022, told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"No one will be fooled by Elissa Slotkin’s sudden ‘moderate’ rebrand.\"\n\n\"There’s nothing moderate about defending open borders, higher taxes, EV mandates, and coddling criminals. Elissa Slotkin is a far-left progressive who continues to surround herself with activists that are completely disconnected from the average American.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Slotkin's office and DeFoe multiple times but did not receive a response.",

        "title": "Trump’s tariffs are finally upon us — and Americans are nervous",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In recent weeks, the Trump administration’s economic policy agenda and the way that agenda is being implemented has spooked consumers, businesses, and investors. The so-called “soft data” — polls and sentiment surveys — reveal a distinctly downward drift in people’s feelings about Trump’s tariffs, DOGE’s layoffs and budget cuts, and the lack of attention to pre-existing stressors such as grocery and housing prices.\n\nThe most recent Consumer Confidence survey took a 6.7% nosedive in February, its biggest drop since August 2021. The index that specifically tracks respondents’ expectations as to where things might be headed fell even faster, down 11.3%. These monthly data tend to be noisy, but they’re backed up by a lot of other data. One consistent finding is that people think tariffs are going to create new price pressures (and, as I previously wrote, they’re right). A Washington Post-Ipsos poll found that “about 7 in 10 Americans think tariffs generally increase the price of products in the United States.” Other data show a 19% plunge in how consumers view buying conditions for big-ticket items, again because of beliefs that tariffs will soon raise prices.\n\nConsumers are nervous, and so are businesses and investors.\n\nGranted, there’s been more bluffing on tariffs than actual tariffs put in place, but that can only go on for so long before the bluffs lose any credibility. Which is perhaps why President Trump now says new tariffs of 25% on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada will take effect this week, plus an additional 10% on China.\n\nThe upshot is that consumers are nervous, and so are businesses and investors, due to the sharp rise in uncertainty about where relevant policy and government actions — trade policy, layoffs of federal workers, cutting of public spending and private contracts — are headed. Trade policy uncertainty is at its highest level since the first Trump administration, according to an index developed by economists Scott Baker, Nick Bloom and Steven Davis (although, as Stephen Cobert said last week, “can you ever really know where you are on the uncertainty index?”).\n\nBut what impact does this all have on the real economy, meaning jobs, incomes, and business investments? After all, during the Biden administration, we lived through years of bad vibes but strong growth, especially consumer spending.\n\nIn fact, the so-called “hard data” — jobs, GDP, unemployment — still look good, but there are worrying signs, with one in particular catching my attention. I’ll get to that indicator in a moment, but first let’s be clear that it takes a lot of bad policy (or bad luck, or bad financial or housing bubbles) to reverse the fortunes of an almost $30 trillion economy comprised of 340 million people. Trump inherited an economy that was reliably growing based on a simple, solid formula: The strong labor market, in tandem with easing inflation, was and is generating real wage gains that support consumer spending, which, at 68% of the US economy, is the biggest portion of GDP. At the same time, business investors have been pretty active, investing in technology, especially AI, but also, encouraged by Biden-era incentives, in domestic production of computer chips and clean energy.\n\nThat said, at the end of last week we learned about one hard indicator that may portend trouble: real consumer spending fell by 0.5% in January. That’s just one month in a noisy data series, January was unusually cold, which can dampen some spending (though not online spending, of course), and spending at the end of last year was strong, so maybe this is just a pause.\n\nBut maybe it isn’t. Spending on big ticket items—“durable goods”—was sharply down in January after strong months in November and December. That suggests consumers, worried about the price impact of the tariffs, tried to get ahead of them at the end of 2024.\n\nBusinesses are clearly concerned — and they know who to blame.\n\nSimilarly, because DOGE layoffs have the potential to hit the earnings of hundreds of thousand of federal workers and private contractors, it would make sense for them to precautionarily save right now. And indeed the January savings rate spiked up by more than a percentage point, a big jump for one month.\n\nBusinesses are clearly concerned — and they know who to blame. A new survey by S&P Global Businesses reports that “firms widely blamed lower sales and activity levels on uncertainty and instability surrounding new government policies in the US, including federal spending cuts and tariff-related developments.”\n\nIt’s not just the private sector feeling uncertain either: Pennsylvania, for example, had $2.1 billion in federal funding frozen or placed under review. After the administration restored the funding, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said, “The federal government entered into agreements with state government agencies to get those dollars out into people’s communities. Those agreements are binding. To put it simply: A deal is a deal.”\n\nYet what if a deal isn’t a deal? What does that do to an economy wherein business, state and local governments, and working families need to plan ahead? Those aren’t rhetorical questions: This degree of uncertainty, coupled with the inflationary impacts of sweeping tariffs, is toxic for sentiment and confidence first, followed by investment, jobs and growth next. It’s too early to know if we’re heading in that dark direction. But there are clear signs for concern.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "I was preparing dinner, as my wife, my 18-year-old son, Nico, and his developmental therapist sat in the family room. Nico is autistic and has Down syndrome; he communicates beautifully with sounds, signs, tech and actions, but each mode requires a lot of work, and it’s only in recent years that he’s begun to make real gains in verbal speech.\n\nSo, as I chopped vegetables and listened to a podcast, they were working on using an app that would say words out loud to prompt Nico’s verbal utterances. Suddenly, my wife called to me, telling me to listen as Nico pressed the screen and made the tablet said, “My dad’s name is David.” I stopped chopping and turned off the podcast. Nico smiled, and prompted by the therapist, verbally said, “Day-ve.” That was good enough for me, but the therapist reminded him to say the final “d,” pointing to it on the screen. Nico looked mischievous as he took a moment to do the full motor planning, his jaw and tongue twitching behind closed lips. Then, he said, “Day-vi-duh.”\n\nAs the first month of the Trump administration comes to a close, attacks on disabled people are emerging on all fronts.\n\nI teared up. I had never heard him say my name. I’m tearing up now as I write this.\n\nThese kinds of moments don’t just happen. They take work, mostly from my son, but also from family, friends, teachers, therapists, doctors, aides and others. That support system has been forged from a combination of laws and government-funded programs that guarantee my son’s rights, provide him resources and offer him opportunities.\n\nThe laws are federal. Much of the funding for the programs are federal. This infrastructure has generally enjoyed broad bipartisan support over the past few decades — until now. When it comes to work, communication, education and health care, not to mention basic human dignity, the Trump administration is ready to abandon kids like my son.\n\nAs the first month of the Trump administration comes to a close, attacks on disabled people are emerging on all fronts. The new “Make America Healthy Again” campaign reads as a targeted attack against support for conditions such as autism or mental illness, not to mention chronic diseases of all sorts. As they did during the last Trump regime, Republicans are seeking to gut Medicaid. Looming closures of Social Security Administration offices around the country will make it much harder for recipients of disability insurance and benefits under the program to apply, get approved and contest denials.\n\nThen there is the Education Department. Though the Senate confirmed Trump’s nominee for education secretary, Linda McMahon, by a 51-45 vote Monday, the White House is still attempting to abolish the department by executive order. For decades, federal funding has been absolutely crucial for special education programs. The Office of Civil Rights in the department provides the means for disabled students and their families to demand accountability and compliance with the law. Terminating the department could also accelerate the devolution of public education into state voucher programs for private schools, which are not legally required to accept disabled students. Even if the department survives, there’s no reason to think McMahon is committed to — or even understands — her department’s critical role in protecting access to education.\n\nI always am eager to look at policy and how it impacts people’s lives, but this story about the collapse of a great bipartisan consensus around disability extends beyond policymakers in Washington. Attacks on disabled Americans and the policies we rely on lie at the core of so much of MAGA culture.\n\nBy chance, the day before Nico said my name, Trump held a press conference about the horrific collision of an army helicopter and a commercial airliner in Washington that killed all 67 passengers and crew. He opened by talking about disability, saying you need to be a “special genius” in order to be an air traffic controller, but then blamed the Federal Aviation Administration for a targeted disability hiring program that includes “hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism.”\n\nFor the record, disabled workers had nothing to do with the crash. Also for the record, many disabled workers are entirely capable of being air traffic controllers. There are no controllers with intellectual disabilities, but plenty of people with other conditions can handle this high stress job as well as anyone else. The FAA, like most federal employers, has worked hard to live up to the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act and hire more disabled workers. It is, after all, not only federal law, but also a competitive advantage that is good for businesses.\n\nIf all this wasn’t enough, when conservatives yell on social media, they increasingly like to use the word “retard.” Trump used it at Joe Biden in the fall before his aides talked him out of it. In early January, Elon Musk tweeted it at a Finnish researcher who had criticized the billionaire. Subsequently, use of the slur tripled on his X platform. Musk now uses it all the time and it's spreading beyond social media.\n\nThis particular right-wing assault on a marginalized population is new. In 2012, conservative pundit Ann Coulter referred to President Barack Obama using that same offensive word, and faced backlash that was immediate, bipartisan and swept across the airwaves. When Fred Trump III, the president’s nephew, reached out to Republican leaders during the first Trump administration in order to shore up support for disabled people like his son, he found lots of allies. Normal Republicans want to help. Over the years, Republicans and Democrats have often disagreed about who counts as disabled and the amount of financial support these programs deserve, but they still preserved a basic consensus on the importance of the ADA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Medicaid.\n\nThis particular right-wing assault on a marginalized population is new.\n\nThose basic guardrails around work, education and health care are now broken. When Fred Trump III approached his uncle in the spring of 2020, the current president said it might be better if Fred’s son — the president’s grandnephew — just died. I believe it. At the FAA briefing the other day, the president talked about people who “suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website. Can you imagine? These are people that are … actually their lives are shortened because of the stress that they have.”\n\nThat’s false. The lives of people like my son are shortened because they don’t have health care. Because they can’t get jobs. Because they can’t find accessible housing. Because when a wildfire rages, no one communicates the threat in a way they can understand. And all of these threats can be ameliorated because the disability rights movement has — haltingly, with many setbacks and disagreements — forced or convinced politicians and policymakers to support basic human dignity. An insufficient but real enforcement mechanism can be found in nearly every federal agency, often located in civil rights wings. Alas, these are the very things now being gutted by the new administration.\n\nIt’s easy to miss the human side of policy, legal compliance, the nitty gritty of efficient government. To get caught up in slogans about fraud or waste. That’s what Musk and Trump are counting on right now as they install their vandals throughout the federal government. And yet my son said my name. I see, and hear, the human side every time my son says “Hi, Daddy!” or now even, “My dad’s name is David.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last week, House Republicans adopted their budget resolution, the first step toward enacting a bill that would kick millions off Medicaid and cut food assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to a meager $1.67 per meal for the typical recipient on average — all while providing an average tax cut of $278,000 to the top 0.1% and adding trillions of dollars to the national deficit.\n\nThere are still many steps left in this budgetary process, but House Republicans aim to use a procedure known as budget reconciliation, which allows the Senate to pass legislation with only 51 votes rather than the usual 60 required. In practical terms, this means Republicans can pass this budget without bipartisan support. In political terms, it means Republicans alone own this budget.\n\nWe know the true targets of this budget resolution.\n\nUnderstandably, there has been strong public pushback against a bill that would rip food and health care away from struggling households while enriching the wealthiest. In response, the refrain from GOP supporters of the budget resolution, again and again, has been to pretend that the resolution isn’t cutting Medicaid.\n\nSure, many House Republicans have said over and over they want to cut Medicaid and SNAP. But they claim they won’t do that. Instead, they say, this resolution merely directs the committees that oversee Medicaid and SNAP to cut spending. Wink, wink.\n\nPut simply, that’s a lie. Not only have House Republicans admitted their intentions, but the simple math of their budget resolution makes cutting these programs necessary.\n\nBudget resolutions create binding instructions for various committees to achieve certain deficit impacts, but those instructions are not and in fact must not be specific about how to achieve those impacts. In other words, while it’s true the instructions don’t specifically call out Medicaid and SNAP, that’s because they’re literally not allowed to mention Medicaid or SNAP.\n\nBut we know the true targets of this budget resolution, because the author — House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas — released a document in January specifying program cuts. And guess what that list featured: hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nRepublicans who support these cuts, even as they pretend the cuts don’t exist, won’t be able to maintain this fiction much longer.\n\nThe math the House voted to approve is also impossible without deep cuts to Medicaid and nearly impossible without cuts to SNAP. The budget resolution as passed instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find at least $880 billion in cuts from fiscal years 2025 through 2034. And it instructs the House Agriculture Committee to find at least $230 billion in cuts within the same window.\n\nThat deficit reduction must come from the programs the committees have jurisdiction over. Only around $500 billion of funding in the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction is not Medicare or Medicaid. If the advocates of this budget resolution aren’t cutting Medicare — which President Donald Trump has promised not to do — then there simply is not enough funding under the Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction to achieve $880 billion in deficit reduction without cutting Medicaid.\n\nThe House Agriculture Committee oversees $1.3 trillion in spending, of which SNAP makes up $1 trillion. It is mathematically possible to leave SNAP untouched — but it would require cutting everything else the committee oversees, on average, by 75 percent. Do you think House Republicans are going to cut all farm programs by 75 percent? Or do you think they’re cutting SNAP, as they’ve said they want to do countless times?\n\nRepublicans who support these cuts, even as they pretend the cuts don’t exist, won’t be able to maintain this fiction much longer. Right now, the House and the Senate are trying to come to an agreement on the budget resolution. At some point, they’ll have to write legislation rather than just a broad framework. And at that point, if the bill reflects what the House passed on Tuesday, the American public will see Republicans eviscerating health care and food assistance to help give tax cuts to millionaires.",

        "title": "Elon Musk said Social Security is a 'Ponzi scheme.' It's the opposite.",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Mega-billionaire and DOGE chief Elon Musk told Joe Rogan last week that he believes Social Security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” and suggested the program is wracked by fraud. That’s ironic coming from a plutocrat who is peddling false “savings” to provide cover for his project to hobble the federal government.\n\nIt was also ironic because Social Security is a highly functioning, universal and exceptionally efficient part of the American social safety net. It’s the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. Which is why the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose cutting it.\n\nThe only people in American politics who are likely to pull the rug out from under retirees is today’s Republican Party.\n\nIn a Ponzi scheme a scam artist lures investors into a fake investment project, pockets a lot of the cash and uses new “investors” to funnel cash to the older ones — until new recruits slow down and the whole thing collapses. Everyone is being lied to, and nobody is really getting returns on their investment.\n\nSocial Security, which has been around since the 1930s, is politically toxic to touch precisely because it does pay everybody out. It is not some kind of black box in which money sloshes around mysteriously but a simple “pay as you go” program, wherein current workers, via the payroll tax, fund payouts for retirees and disabled people. In 2024, about 1 in 5 U.S. residents received Social Security.\n\nAs the Social Security Administration explains, “In 2025, when you work, about 85 cents of every Social Security tax dollar you pay goes to a trust fund. This fund pays monthly benefits to current retirees and their families and to surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. About 15 cents goes to a trust fund that pays benefits to people with disabilities and their families.”\n\nAnd as the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities notes, in part because Social Security is universal and isn’t means-tested, it’s extremely cost-effective: Managing the program costs less than 1% of the revenue that funds the program.\n\nSocial Security isn’t unreliable — almost all retired Americans pay into it and draw from it. And, as the CBPP explains, Social Security is “most workers’ only source of guaranteed retirement income that is not subject to investment risk or financial market fluctuations.”\n\nMusk’s argument that Social Security is some kind of scheme to defraud the public rests in part on misinformation about dead people getting payouts. In the interview, Musk repeated a claim about tens of millions of people incorrectly being marked as “alive” in the Social Security database. But experts have debunked this claim by explaining that Musk has conflated Social Security number figures with actual beneficiaries and said there’s no evidence of widespread fraud. The SSA’s inspector general found in 2024 that only 0.84% of the trillions of dollars disbursed from 2015 to 2022 were improperly allocated. Most of those improper payments were overpayments, and some of them were recovered.\n\nThe other thing Musk cites as evidence that Social Security is a scheme are the numbers that show Social Security obligations exceed projected tax revenue. That’s true and universally acknowledged — and not remotely scandalous. With people living longer lives and the birth rate decreasing, there will need to be a change to Social Security funding in order to keep the program working at the level it currently works at. There are a number of strategies for dealing with this that have to do with changing the way taxes fund Social Security.\n\nThe only people in American politics who are likely to pull the rug out from under retirees is today’s Republican Party. Musk’s misinformation about Social Security, his and President Donald Trump’s constant claims that it needs to be probed for a nonexistent mass waste and fraud problems and massive cuts to the Social Security Administration’s workforce are themselves the red flags that should have American taxpayers who’ve paid into the system worried about being taken for a ride.",

        "title": "Trump and Musk's disregard for paying USAID contracts didn't come from nowhere",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday night temporarily paused a looming deadline for the Trump administration to release more than $1.5 billion in foreign aid funding. Chief Justice John Roberts’ order was brief but still a major win for the White House in its effort to tear down the U.S. Agency for International Development. In coverage of and reaction to the Supreme Court’s ruling, one fact has gone underemphasized: The lower court order, which is now on hold, required the government to pay for work that has already been completed.\n\nThe administration’s withholding of that money represents a stunning disregard for contracts signed and executed in good faith. This culture of deliberate default on display can’t spring from nowhere — it must be encouraged and supported at the top. Given the history of the two men driving this rapid, and likely illegal, dismantling of USAID, it follows that President Donald Trump and Elon Musk see paying bills as merely an option that can be discarded.\n\nThe administration’s withholding of that money represents a stunning disregard for contracts signed and executed in good faith.\n\nSince Trump was inaugurated, USAID has been the most imperiled test subject of his administration’s mad experiment to consolidate control of the federal government. The foreign aid freeze that he signed on his first day immediately jeopardized thousands of projects and many more lives around the world. A lack of understanding of how federal payment systems work reportedly led Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to say they believed USAID workers were willfully skirting the freeze — and deserved to be made into an example.\n\nMusk tried to dodge blame for one of the “accidentally canceled” programs, claiming that DOGE quickly “restored” funding for Ebola prevention that USAID administers. Current and former USAID officials told The Washington Post that is false. In fact, most of the aid work USAID was doing remains paused. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered the administration to disburse funding that USAID had previously promised to pay contractors and grant recipients. When the State Department’s lawyers dithered in court Tuesday on whether that money had been released, the judge on Tuesday issued a follow-up order to have USAID pay up for work that had already been done prior to his initial Feb. 13 order. The Trump administration argued to the Supreme Court that there wasn’t enough time to carry out Ali’s order, leading to Roberts’ stay.\n\nPurposefully letting bills go unpaid is something that most Americans have been conditioned to regard as rightly punishable; it is only the rich who can afford to disregard paying their creditors. Over the years, Trump and Musk have both been accused of reneging on deals after already receiving the benefit of others’ labor.\n\nTrump and his companies have been subject to numerous legal actions from contractors and others accusing the real estate developer of welching on deals. “The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years,” USA Today reported in 2016. “In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.”\n\nAnother investigation that year from The Wall Street Journal found “a pattern over Mr. Trump’s 40-year career of his sometimes refusing to pay what some business owners said Trump companies owed them.” Trump told the Journal he paid “thousands of bills on time,” which is not the same as all of his bills. He likewise told Reuters in a separate inquiry about his business practices: “‘I’ve had many people that when they work for me they get very rich,’ Trump said … but, ‘sometimes I renegotiate.’ Adding: ‘I’ll do that with probably 10 or 15 percent of contractors.’”\n\nPurposefully letting bills go unpaid is something that most Americans have been conditioned to regard as rightly punishable; it is only the rich who can afford to disregard paying their creditors\n\nMusk’s companies have also been subject to similar complaints. Within four months of his takeover of Twitter (now dubbed X) in late 2022, six companies sued his new business over unpaid bills. After less than a year under Musk, the number of lawsuits over unpaid bills had grown to more than two dozen. “Suing X,” wrote Ars Technica’s Jon Brodkin, “seems to be the most effective method of collecting on unpaid invoices.”\n\nReuters also reported last year that based on a review of Texas property records, Musk’s rocket company SpaceX has been slow to pay bills for work done as it expands. Reuters noted at the time that it “couldn’t determine for every lien whether outstanding bills were owed by SpaceX or by one of its contractors who commissioned work or materials on its behalf,” and Musk has attacked Reuters’ reporting repeatedly via his X account. As with Trump, many of those cases involving Musk have been settled while others face ongoing, potentially very expensive, litigation.\n\nThe amount that Musk and Trump have been accused of not paying totals somewhere in the millions — but the federal contracts at play are measured in the billions. State Department lawyers blamed the delay in restoring that funding on the complexity of the system, claiming it couldn’t be turned back on like a spigot. But in the same filings, they also noted the administration is eliminating 90% of the contracts USAID administers and more than $60 billion in foreign assistance. In short, the Trump administration is arguing that the spigot is under its sole control, not the courts’ or Congress’, and effectively claiming the right to break legally binding contracts on a whim.\n\nBased on the sweeping and arbitrary cuts to staff and funding we’re seeing, USAID won’t be the only agency whose partners and contractors will be subject to this kind of capriciousness. It is entirely possible, though, that the work that still needs to be done in the areas where staffing has been cut and contracts ended will now be much more expensive in the long run. (Think about how Trump’s reported issues with paying his lawyers on time drove up the prices for those attorneys willing to still take him on as a client.)\n\nMusk and DOGE claim that decimating USAID will save taxpayers money and increase government efficiency. Growing doubts that the federal government will pay for services rendered will likely be seen as a bonus for the architects of this quest to fracture the administrative state. If anything, removing trust in government contracts will more likely lead to higher costs for taxpayers, as expensive contractors require upfront payments to ensure that the U.S. won’t simply leave them on the hook once the job is done.\n\nMoreover, blatantly disregarding USAID’s contracts poses a danger to the entire underpinning of our civil court system, which is built on the idea that contracts signed without duress are sacrosanct. Musk and Trump’s actions have suggested instead that for a powerful enough agent — be it a company or the federal government — there can be no enforcement, no accountability should they change their mind. For that reason alone, the Supreme Court’s hold cannot be allowed to stand on the merits, not if contracts are to have any weight of law.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Late last week, a publication called The Record, which focuses on news related to cybersecurity, published a report that seemed hard to believe. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the outlet reported, “ordered U.S. Cyber Command to stand down from all planning against Russia, including offensive digital actions.”\n\nTwo days later, Rep. Mike Turner, the former Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation” and was asked if the report was true. The Ohio congressman said he was “certain” that it had to be wrong.\n\n“I’m confident, considering what Russia is currently doing against the United States, that the United States, the status against Russia would not be that, considering what we are facing from Russia operations,” Turner added.\n\nI can appreciate why the GOP lawmaker was incredulous. The idea that the Trump administration would take such a step certainly appears absurd. And yet, NBC News reported that the reporting in The Record was correct.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said. Hegseth gave the order to the head of the command, Air Force Gen. Tim Haugh, in late February, the official said. It is unclear clear how long the order will last.\n\nA report in The New York Times, which cited additional sources, added, “[R]etaining access to major Russian networks for espionage purposes is critical to understanding Mr. Putin’s intentions as he enters negotiations, and to tracking the arguments within Russia about what conditions to insist upon and what could be given up.”\n\nThat access, at least for now, has been curtailed. It led Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to say in a written statement, “Donald Trump is so desperate to earn the affection of a thug like Vladimir Putin he appears to be giving him a free pass as Russia continues to launch cyber operations and ransomware attacks against critical American infrastructure, threatening our economic and national security.”\n\nThe New York Democrat added, “It is a critical strategic mistake for Donald Trump to unilaterally disarm against Putin.”\n\nAs jarring as this is on its face, the developments appear even worse when seen in context.\n\nHegseth’s order roughly coincided with Donald Trump’s Oval Office debacle with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the American president echoing Kremlin talking points, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump White House curtailing U.S. aid to Ukraine, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration terminating an initiative to protect Ukraine’s energy grid, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the president saying he’s prepared to reward Russia by welcoming it back into the G7, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration disbanding the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration paring back enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration targeting U.S. intelligence officials as part of its mass firing campaign, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration slashing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nA cynic might wonder if the White House were simply taking directions from the Kremlin directly.\n\nAfter the story about Hegseth’s order reached the public, the president turned to his social media platform to declare that Americans “should spend less time worrying about Putin.” What a coincidence: That’s exactly what Moscow wants him to say.",

In the lead-up to the 2016 Oscars, the state of North Carolina banned trans people from bathrooms in one of the first attacks on trans rights to reach nationwide awareness. The state was hit with mass protests and boycotts for its intolerance. At the same time, actor Eddie Redmayne was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Danish trans woman Lili Elbe, one of the first transgender women to get gender-affirming surgery in the 1930s.\n\nRedmayne’s casting and subsequent Oscar buzz was widely decried by trans people, who argued that the role of one of history’s most significant trans women should have been played by a trans actress.\n\nAt the time, it was common practice to cast a cis male to play a trans woman in any mainstream Hollywood film, a decision that can incorrectly give moviegoers the idea that trans women are really men playing pretend as women. Just a year before, Jared Leto had won an Oscar for best supporting actor for playing a fictional trans woman in “Dallas Buyers Club.” A Redmayne win in 2016 would have given audiences the same idea. I can still remember the relief on trans Twitter that Oscar night when Redmayne didn’t win.\n\nIn the casting respect, at least, \"Emilia Pérez\" gets it right, having cast trans actress Karla Sofía Gascón in the lead role as a trans woman. She is up for best actress in this year’s Oscars, but her chances of winning are complicated by a series of offensive tweets about Muslims and George Floyd that surfaced from years ago.\n\nAs a trans person who also happens to run a podcast about cancel culture, I find it interesting that Gascón has been so quickly marginalized on the basis of old tweets, when other celebrities haven’t necessarily faced the same consequences for similar or even more egregious actions.\n\nMake no mistake, the tweets are racist and Islamophobic, and should be condemned. But she would hardly be the first celebrity with bigoted opinions. I mean, Mel Gibson seems to be embarking on a comeback after his infamous antisemitic rants. They’re still making “Harry Potter” movies for J.K. Rowling. Dave Chappelle still has a robust comedy career.\n\nThe frustrating reality is that trans women are often the first to get thrown under the bus when it comes to controversies like these. Social media is littered with the former accounts of trans women who dared draw negative attention to themselves before being run off the internet.\n\nThe frustrating reality is that trans women are often the first to get thrown under the bus when it comes to controversies like these.\n\nWhile Gascón said she still plans on attending the award ceremony itself, she has skipped the typical pre-Oscars pomp and parties that usuallt come with being a nominee. It feels to me as if she has been thrown out of the club to allow the absolutely horrid film she starred in to stay in the general Oscar hunt for other awards.\n\nGascón may be seemingly out of the running for an Oscar even though she’s nominated, but her cisgender co-stars and the film itself are still up for multiple awards despite near universal distaste for the movie.\n\nThere’s precedent for all of this. In 2019, the Oscars gave best picture to “Green Book,” despite widespread criticism from Black film critics and audiences, and amid reports of derogatory tweets and racist language from co-writer Nick Vallelonga and co-star Viggo Mortensen.\n\nIn the end, I wish films wouldn’t get rewarded by the academy for telling awful trans stories, or for portraying trans women as men playing pretend. It bothers me that “Emilia Pérez” is getting so many flowers this year while films like “I Saw the TV Glow,” an incredibly produced and nuanced horror film from A24 that tells an allegory about being in the closet as a trans person, has gone widely ignored (even, shockingly, by the GLAAD Awards). “I Saw the TV Glow” connected viscerally with nearly every trans person I know who saw it, and it was directed by nonbinary director Jane Schoenbrun.\n\n“Emilia Pérez,” on the other hand, perpetuates a lazy trope about the trans experience that feels especially harmful in the present political climate.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump is selling America, literally.\n\nThe administration's latest immigration proposal is something that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called the \"Trump gold card\" — a visa for wealthy foreigners willing to spend $5 million for a pathway to U.S. citizenship.\n\nWhen Trump delivers his first address to Congress on Tuesday night, he will likely frame this idea as a matter of economic pragmatism, although research shows these “golden visa” programs typically contribute no more than 0.3% of the gross domestic product and have a negligible impact on growth.\n\nBut it's more insidious than that. This new proposal is in keeping with Trump's idea of America as one of exclusion, not inclusion.\n\nAt the same time that he wants to sell citizenship to the highest bidders, Trump is seeking to remove people who are already here. In his first term, he separated families of migrants who had crossed the border illegally and sought to ban travelers from six Muslim majority countries. In his second term, he's outsourced deportations, used Guantánamo Bay as a migrant detention site and sought to make it easier for immigration agents to enter places of worship.\n\nIt's a wholesale rewrite of what it means to be an American.\n\nThe \"gold card\" proposal is the flip side of this dark record. More than just a policy, it's a wholesale rewrite of what it means to be an American. In Trump’s vision, citizenship is no longer about building a shared national project; it is an asset reserved for those who can afford it, as it is in countries with \"golden visa\" programs such as Malta and Cyprus. Being American would become a high-end commodity, available only to the wealthy.\n\nThe proposal exploits the growing disillusionment of working-class Americans in urban and suburban communities who feel the ground crumbling beneath them. They’ve spent their lives working hard, only to see their jobs shipped overseas and their communities hollowed out. As prices rise and making ends meet becomes harder, opportunity feels like a winner-takes-all scenario. When local programs lose funding, factories shut down and jobs disappear. When communities feel the surge of illegal immigration and see government resources misallocated, resentment festers. And when families who have lived in these neighborhoods for generations struggle while new arrivals seek a better life, frustration turns to division.\n\nBut immigrants don’t weaken America, they strengthen it. Families who come here to work, build and contribute are the very people who keep the country’s promise alive.\n\nDemocrats, meantime, are failing to meet the moment. It is not enough to call Trump’s immigration policies inhumane. They are that but they are also something more dangerous: a seductive narrative about who deserves to be here and why. And as Trump spins this narrative, Democrats remain unable to articulate a compelling vision of what American citizenship should mean.\n\nDemocrats had the chance in 2024, and they blew it. Instead of making a forceful argument for immigration as a system of order, security and national strength, they hedged and waffled. Instead of calling Trump’s bluff — pointing out that his party has no real plan beyond exclusion — they let the debate be defined on his terms because of border influx that the Biden administration failed to address and on out-of-touch ideas that presidential candidates floated in 2020.\n\nAmerica has never been just a marketplace. It has always been a national project of people and heritage — something greater than GDP, something defined not just by who gets in, but also by what those people contribute and how they become part of a shared culture and set of values. That is the difference between citizenship and consumerism, between a nation and a business deal. And it is that idea that Democrats must champion.\n\nThe American dream isn’t just an abstraction, it’s what has driven generations to work night shifts, to build something better, to believe in endless possibility.\n\nThe American dream isn’t just an abstraction, it’s what has driven generations to work night shifts, to build something better, to believe in endless possibility. And that dream can only survive if America remains a place that rewards effort, not just privilege. That is the vision Democrats need to fight for, not a country where citizenship is auctioned off to the highest bidder, but one where longtime residents and immigrants alike are given a fair shot.\n\nA serious Democratic vision for immigration cannot just respond to Trump’s daily theatrics. It must be a common-sense approach that upholds both security and strength, stops the flow of illegal immigration, fights crime and recognizes immigration as a cornerstone of the American project — not a problem to be managed, not a privilege for the rich, but an opportunity to strengthen the nation. If Democrats fail to make that case, they will once again find themselves on defense against a movement that has already decided what America should be.\n\nTrump's address should be a warning. His immigration agenda is not just a policy, but it's also a vision for America’s future. If Democrats do not counter it with one of their own, they will have lost the fight before it even began.\n\nSubscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates on and expert insight into the key issues and figures defining his second term.",

        "content": "As Friday’s fiasco in the Oval Office made painfully clear to the nation and the world, Donald Trump and his White House have a problem with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Indeed, over the last few days, there’s been all kinds of talk emanating from the West Wing about the Ukrainian leader needing to “apologize” to the American president — and perhaps even resigning.\n\nBut what is it, specifically, that Zelenskyy did that was wrong?\n\nZelenskyy apparently made the wrong fashion choices: Before the Ukrainian leader even entered the White House, he was greeted by Trump, who said: “Look, you’re all dressed up today.” Interest in Zelenskyy’s clothing intensified from there, especially among conservative media personalities — though they appeared far less concerned about Elon Musk wearing a baseball cap and a “tech support” T-shirt in the West Wing.\n\nZelenskyy apparently used “body language” the White House didn’t like: During an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said the Ukrainian president was “incredibly disrespectful” while being berated in the Oval Office. To bolster the point, he pointed to “the body language, the shaking of head ... the arms crossed.”\n\nZelenskyy apparently had criticisms for the authoritarian leader who invaded his country and butchered his people: After the Ukrainian leader said Russia’s Vladimir Putin “hates” Ukraine, Trump chided Zelensky for “speaking badly about somebody else” — because if there’s one thing we know about the Republican president, it’s that he just cannot abide speaking badly about people.\n\nZelenskyy apparently “litigated”: Waltz and JD Vance have complained more than once in recent days that the Ukrainian president “litigated” in public, which apparently means he told the truth about the war in his country. Those are facts U.S. officials recognized and agreed with up until six weeks ago, and it’s not at all clear why Zelenskyy was supposed to keep the truth to himself during his White House visit.\n\nZelenskyy apparently “Ukraine-splained”: Two days after the fiasco in the Oval Office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio complained that the Ukrainian leader “found every opportunity to try to ‘Ukraine-splain’ on every issue.” Of course, had the American president and vice president not made so many factual errors, and had been less eager to echo the Kremlin’s talking points, it’s likely that Zelenskyy wouldn’t have felt the need to explain the basics to his hosts in ways that hurt their feelings.\n\nEach of these complaints make Trump and his team appear rather weak and easily offended — unless, of course, the White House planned to take offense from the outset, and Republican officials looked for post-hoc rationalizations to justify the positions they were going to take anyway.",

        "title": "Elon Musk slams Social Security as a ‘Ponzi scheme,’ sparking new concerns",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s recent social media posts leave little doubt: He has been thinking about Social Security a lot lately. In fact, Donald Trump’s biggest campaign donor and the head of the quasi-governmental DOGE operation keeps tweeting bizarre claims about alleged fraud and “inconsistencies” he thinks he has identified in the Social Security system.\n\nThose claims have invariably collapsed under scrutiny. Indeed, it has become rather embarrassing lately. Musk claimed, for example, that millions of people over the age of 130 were receiving Social Security checks — he said it was perhaps “the biggest fraud in the history of humanity” — but none of this was true.\n\nIt’s possible that the billionaire GOP megadonor just doesn’t know enough about government programs to understand how wrong he is. It’s also possible that Musk is indifferent to the facts and is engaged in a misinformation campaign. Either way, there’s no reason for the public to take his claims at face value, since they keep getting debunked.\n\nIt’s against this backdrop that many of the nation’s most powerful Republicans, including Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, continue to peddle Musk’s claims about Social Security as if they were true. They are not.\n\nBut the problem is not limited to Musk’s falsehoods. After all, the fact that he’s plainly wrong might not be consequential at all: Musk claims to have found “fraud”; reality proves otherwise; and we all move on with our lives. Right?\n\nWell, maybe not. Making matters worse is the apparent fact that the donor helping run the executive branch in 2025 has a problem with the Social Security system itself. USA Today reported:\n\nElon Musk sharply criticized Social Security in a Friday podcast interview with Joe Rogan, labeling the critical elder benefits program a “Ponzi scheme.” Musk, who is the world’s richest man and an increasingly powerful adviser to President Donald Trump, also described the federal government as “one big pyramid scheme.” Musk is a leading figure in the administration’s effort — largely through the Department of Government Efficiency — to cut costs and dismantle the federal bureaucracy.\n\nAnd it’s at this point where the offensive becomes tougher to shrug off.\n\nIndeed, let’s take stock. Trump has put his top campaign donor in a position of enormous authority, despite Musk’s unfamiliarity with basics of governing. This same donor regularly peddles falsehoods about Social Security, keeps suggesting there are people receiving benefits checks that shouldn’t exist, is helping advance thousands of layoffs at the Social Security administration and, in case that weren’t quite enough, is condemning the structure of the popular social insurance program.\n\nIt’d be tough to blame someone who relies on Social Security for feeling a bit nervous right about now.\n\n“You don’t need to scratch your head and wonder what’s going on when you see that the Trump administration is decimating Social Security offices and staff,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “And you don’t need to ponder what might happen next when Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, says that the tens-of-millions of seniors, families, and children who depend on these earned benefits are part of some scam — because that’s a real threat and a real promise: they are coming for your Social Security.”\n\nThe New York Democrat added, “The richest man in the world and his sidekick, the President of the United States, have decided to attack the bedrock of America’s social safety net, and now your pocket is in the way.”\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "title": "How the right's anti-Ukraine shift happened",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "With President Donald Trump and officials in his administration channeling Kremlin-created narratives on the war in Ukraine, cozying up to Vladimir Putin and opposing a United Nations resolution naming Russia as the aggressor, one may legitimately ask if Trump’s America is now allied with Putin’s Russia. And another long-simmering question comes back with a new urgency: What is it with the American right and Putin?\n\nTo some extent, the right wing’s Putin lovefest is simply the result of cultlike fealty to Trump: If he blasted the Putin regime as an evil empire tomorrow, most conservative pundits and “influencers” would follow. But Trump’s evident affection for the Moscow dictator — which doesn’t require conspiratorial explanations like KGB recruitment or blackmail — also lines up with some independently existing trends on the right.\n\nTo some extent, the right wing’s Putin lovefest is simply the result of cultlike fealty to Trump.\n\nIn an astute analysis, expatriate Russian political strategist Stanislav Belkovsky argued that Trump’s affinity for Putin is explained by several factors: his hatred for the American and European political “establishment” and readiness to see its enemies (including Putin) as allies; his general affection for authoritarian rulers; and grudges over what he sees as his persecution by Democrats over charges of pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine misconduct.\n\nBut it’s not just Trump: Plenty of others on the right share some of these attitudes.\n\nAnti-establishment animus, for instance, has long flourished among conservatives — and, almost by definition, among libertarians.\n\nFor some, the hostility is directed at America’s “interventionist” global leadership and often accompanied by sympathy for America’s foes abroad. One prominent exponent of such views is former Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who, in addition to his GOP presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, actually was the Libertarian Party’s nominee in 1988. Paul was described as “Putin’s new best friend” by Lucia Graves in National Journal at the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2014 for his knee-jerk defenses of Putin and attacks on what Paul referred to as “Western politicians and media.” While his son Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a much tougher stance toward Moscow at the time, he has more recently moved into the more pro-Russia camp, even praising what he called Trump’s “message to the Ukrainian warmongers.”\n\nOthers see the modern secular West as a den of anti-Christian decadence and readily fall for Putin’s posturing as a champion of traditional and religious values. Back in 2013, right-wing populist Pat Buchanan — whose xenophobic revolt against the GOP establishment in the 1990s foreshadowed Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement — hailed Putin as “one of us” in the culture war against the “new immorality.” For others, the issue is “globalism” or “cancel culture” or distrust of the “mainstream media” — while Putin’s Russia is seen as a stronghold of national sovereignty, an “anti-woke” haven, or a source of alternative narratives.\n\nAnd for some figures on the right such as Tucker Carlson — who is a leader, not a follower, in the Trumpian right’s pro-Russia drift — all these preoccupations are rolled into one big ball of anti-Western, pro-Russian contrarianism.\n\nNeedless to say, Putin’s right-wing fans are untroubled by the contradictions between their ideals and the reality of the Putin regime — a reality in which the “cancellation” of dissenters is often quite literal (see Alexei Navalny or Boris Nemtsov), assaults on Christianity take the form of horrific persecution against Ukrainian evangelical Christians and other Protestants in Russian-occupied territories, and Ukraine’s national sovereignty is trampled in a brutal war of aggression. The regime’s actual values don’t matter as long as they can be a battering ram against “the establishment.”\n\nThe role of authoritarianism in the right’s Putin sympathies shouldn’t be discounted either. “National Conservatism,” an intellectual movement launched during Trump’s first term to give Trumpian populism a respectable foundation, is openly contemptuous of liberalism — not only in its left-of-center American political sense, but in a more classical sense that includes the pro-liberty, pro-individual rights conservatism of Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe role of authoritarianism in the right’s Putin sympathies shouldn’t be discounted.\n\nOne author associated with the movement, Christopher Caldwell, offered a gushy valentine to Putin as a “hero to populist conservatives around the world” in a 2017 speech at conservative-leaning Hillsdale College. While acknowledging Putin’s repression of dissent and likely connection to political murders, Caldwell wrote that Putin was an outstanding leader by “traditional measures” such as “the defense of borders and national flourishing.” While these claims look particularly ironic today after the damage Putin’s war has inflicted on Russia, the overt declaration that leaders should be measured by standards that pointedly exclude liberty and respect for human rights is especially startling.\n\nMeanwhile, far-right blogger Curtis Yarvin, a self-proclaimed monarchist who openly advocates for the replacement of liberal democracy with autocracy, has fantasized that the Putin regime will not only conquer Ukraine but reprise Tsarist Russia’s (brief) 19th-century role as the crusher of liberalism in Europe. This crankery would be negligible if Vice President JD Vance hadn’t expressed admiration for Yarvin’s work.\n\nStill, outright Putin love is fairly rare in GOP ranks; the fawning is limited mostly to a small cadre of pundits, too-online influencers and trolls. A recent Economist/YouGov poll found that only 18% of Republicans had a favorable opinion of the Russian dictator. But that’s still too high (the comparable numbers for Democrats and independents are 8% and 9%, respectively), and it’s likely this 18% comes from the hardcore, activist part of the “base.” In the same poll, Republicans were the only group in which negative opinions of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dominated: 40% unfavorable to 38% favorable.\n\nThose are dangerous trends. The MAGA-fied GOP may not be in the Putin camp, but it is already leaning toward the anti-Ukraine camp. And this drift is based on misguided devotion to Trump and even more misguided ideas about Russia and the West.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The NBC affiliate in Denver ran a strange story last week about a group of Republicans in Colorado who came up with an unusual request for the Trump administration. According to the local report, these GOP officials envision a scheme in which the White House agrees to block funding for the Rocky Mountain State until Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, agrees to pardon a convicted criminal named Tina Peters.\n\nIt was, to be sure, a bizarre pitch, which will not and cannot happen, but it was a timely reminder that for some on the far-right, Peters’ case remains highly relevant. In fact, The New York Times reported that even Donald Trump’s Justice Department has apparently taken an interest in the matter.\n\nThe Justice Department said on Monday that it would review the conviction of the former clerk of Mesa County, Colo., who was found guilty of state charges last summer of tampering with voting machines under her control in a failed attempt to prove that they had been used to rig the 2020 election against President Trump. The decision was the latest example of the Justice Department under Mr. Trump’s control seeking to use its powers to support those who have acted on his behalf and to go after those who have criticized or opposed him.\n\nWhile the Times’ report hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the developments are not the subject of rumor or scuttlebutt: The article specifically noted that the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil division unexpectedly filed a court this week, declaring that “reasonable concerns have been raised about various aspects of Ms. Peters’s case.”\n\nAt this point, some readers might be thinking, “Her name sounds familiar, but I’m not quite sure who Tina Peters is.” With this in mind, let’s take a stroll down memory lane.\n\nPeters was a county clerk in Colorado who eagerly embraced Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories about his 2020 election defeat, but that’s not all she did. Peters also acted on those lies and conspiracy theories, using someone’s security badge to allow a Mike Lindell associate to access county election equipment.\n\nThe apparent point of the endeavor was to leak election machinery data in pursuit of a conspiratorial plot that never existed in reality.\n\nNot surprisingly, Peters was caught and indicted. She pleaded not guilty, but after she and her attorney struggled to present a compelling defense, a Colorado jury convicted Peters, finding her guilty of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.\n\nAhead of sentencing, Peters showed no remorse. A judge ultimately sentenced her to nine years behind bars.\n\nThis was a state official, charged with state crimes, by state prosecutors, in a state court, with a state jury, overseen by a state judge. What did the case have to do with federal law enforcement? Literally nothing.\n\nAnd yet, six weeks into the Trump administration, the Republican-led Justice Department is nevertheless taking an interest in the case\n\nThe scrutiny of Peters case, according to Yaakov Roth, the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil division, was an extension of the president’s executive order related to ending the “weaponization of the federal government.”\n\nBut this turns reality on its head. The Justice Department’s unwarranted intervention in this case serves as a timely reminder that, in 2025, federal law enforcement is focused on the interests of Trump’s friends and allies.\n\nThe brazenness is so plainly ridiculous, the Republican administration is hardly even trying to keep up appearances, and there’s every reason to believe this will get worse in the coming days, weeks, months and years.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In no time at all, speaking a language other than English in public is going to feel like an act of political defiance. On Friday morning, The Wall Street Journal first reported that the president would sign an executive order to make English the official language of the United States. The White House later confirmed the move, and as NBC News notes, “it’s the first time in history the country would have an official language.”\n\nAt first glance, Donald Trump’s move might seem like common sense.\n\nAt first glance, Donald Trump’s move might seem like common sense. The vast majority of Americans speak English: According to the most recent census data, 78.3% of the country speaks only English at home. That the U.S. is an English-dominant country cannot be disputed. But the order would bring with it more insidious consequences that demonstrate Trump and his allies mean to enforce a restrictive definition of what it means to be American.\n\nBecause this executive order isn’t just about acknowledging the dominance of English. It would also rescind the federal mandate that requires federal agencies and other recipients of federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. This mandate, originally issued by President Bill Clinton, ensured that millions of Americans could access government services, regardless of their primary language. CBS News reports that agencies will still be able to provide documents and services in other languages, but this order strips away the requirement to do so. In effect, it gives permission to shut out non-English speakers from services their tax dollars pay for.\n\nStripping this access will make life significantly harder for millions — according to 2019 census data, approximately 8% of the country speaks English less than “very well” — leaving them without guaranteed access to critical information and support. Without required language access, navigating essential services will become more difficult.\n\nStill more troubling, Trump’s proposed executive order is not merely about language policy. It is also the latest move in a long American tradition of leveraging English proficiency to judge who “belongs” and who does not.\n\nThroughout our history, the effort to define this country as monolingually English has coincided with efforts to exclude certain groups from full participation in society. Indigenous children were forced into boarding schools where they were punished for speaking their own languages. Spanish was banned from classrooms in the Southwest to force assimilation. During World War I, laws were passed to ban German in schools. The push for English-only policies has never been about communication; it has always been about control, about who gets to be seen as fully American and who does not.\n\nThat sentiment was evident on Friday when ProEnglish — which bills itself as “the nation’s leading advocate of official English” but has ties to the modern anti-immigrant movement — quickly praised Trump’s plan.\n\n“The president properly responded to the disconnect that undermined America’s traditional process of immigrant assimilation. Every American should be proud of their national origin, race, native language, and customs. But without public policies that reinforce the English tie that unites us, multilingual diversity could well become the undoing of our country,” said acting ProEnglish Executive Director Stephanie White.\n\nRhetoric that frames non-English speakers (or even bilingual and trilingual Americans) as unpatriotic infiltrators might appeal to xenophobic Americans, but it has no basis in reality. Immigrants and their children overwhelmingly learn English. One Cato Institute report from 2019 estimates that “about 91 percent of immigrants in the United States between 1980 and 2010 reportedly spoke English compared with 86 percent who lived here from 1900 to 1930. While immigrants with different backgrounds are more or less likely to learn English than others, our analysis unambiguously shows that today’s immigrants are more likely to learn English than immigrants in the beginning of the last century.”\n\nRhetoric that frames non-English speakers (or even bilingual and trilingual Americans) as unpatriotic infiltrators has no basis in reality.\n\nYet English-only advocates continue to promote the false idea that linguistic diversity threatens national identity. They ignore the fact that the U.S. has always been multilingual; that by the 16th century, Spanish was spoken in much of the Southwest, years before English arrived; and that Indigenous languages existed here for centuries before colonization.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. is the fourth-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world, according to the Cervantes Institute, and home to more than 350 languages, according to the Census Bureau. The suggestion that the only authentic way to be American is to speak English, exclusively, ignores both history and modern reality: that America has always been polyglot.\n\n“America has never had an official language — because we don’t need one,” the Congressional Hispanic Caucus posted Friday afternoon on X. “Trump’s plan to make English official is a direct attack on our diversity and history. Millions of Americans speak other languages, and that doesn’t make them any less American.”\n\nTrump’s executive order would do nothing to improve government efficiency or to help Americans. It does not even have material benefits to those who speak only English. Rather, it strips away language access protections and sends a clear message: If you don’t speak English, you don’t belong. The move is yet more extremist, political bullying that divides us further.\n\nTrump can make English the official language, but language has always been fluid and evolving, shaped by the people who speak it. And in classrooms, communities and political spaces, non-English speakers have long been active participants in shaping this country. This proposed executive order cannot change that.",

        "content": "This post is part of the digital companion series to Jen Psaki’s “The Blueprint,” a new podcast examining where Democrats stand after big losses in 2024 and how they can win again. Below is an adapted excerpt edited for length and clarity from the March 3 episode featuring former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams.\n\nWithin hours of taking office, President Donald Trump followed through on one of his top campaign promises, attacking diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal workforce. But what Trump and other Republicans have failed to realize is that DEI isn’t new and it isn’t tangential. Although the acronym gained attention in the past 5 to 10 years, the core principles it represents have been around since America’s inception.\n\nWe’ve allowed the intention of DEI to be hijacked by those who want the freedom to discriminate.\n\nWe know that from the very beginning of this country, despite our national credo, the government purportedly by and for the people immediately raised barriers to block full participation in the American Dream. To dismantle these impediments, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments were necessary first steps toward including Black Americans. Native Americans received citizenship in 1924 and the Chicano Movement began to remedy the oppression of Mexican-Americans. We had the 19th Amendment and Title IX to help women get on equal footing. We have the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title I for poor kids, and the Family and Medical Leave Act. Despite their timing and target, these are all massive DEI laws. Laws passed by Democrats and Republicans, all intended to make sure that diversity, equity and inclusion are part of our nation’s story.\n\nSimply put, diversity means all people. That’s all it is. Diversity means all people should have the chance to participate. Equity means that everyone has a fair opportunity. Inclusion means everyone should have a pathway to the American dream. Our entire country is premised on DEI, a foundational set of values that oppose uniformity, inequality and exclusivity. But the problem is, we’ve allowed the intention of DEI to be hijacked by those who want the freedom to discriminate.\n\nSo when you see people who are anti-DEI, what we should be asking is which part don’t they like? Is it opposition to the diversity part, because they think too many people get a fair shot in today’s America? Do they not like the idea of equity, because they don’t want to have to compete? Or are they offended by inclusion because they believe some people should be isolated and kept away from opportunity?\n\nWe, as Americans, have to correct past mistakes and provide everyone with access to the ability to improve their beginnings and imagine more. As legal scholar Kenji Yoshino said to me recently, “Talent is everywhere. Opportunity is not.” DEI is about how we marry the two.\n\nToo often, race, gender, disability, class, sexual identity and other differences are dismissed as cultural issues. And it’s not just the Republican Party treating immutable characteristics as choices to be made. In the aftermath of Kamala Harris’ loss, some members of the Democratic Party argued that paying too much attention to the attacks on these communities drove voters away. But I push back on that idea and against the relegation of my humanity as merely a cultural issue, like the kind of music I like or the TV shows I prefer.\n\nPart of Trump’s tactical toolbox is chaos and cacophony. He makes so much noise that you forget to look at what he’s actually doing.\n\nI am a woman, so abortion rights are not a cultural issue. It’s a medical issue. It’s an economic issue. It’s an educational issue. It’s a moral issue. As a Black person, my race isn’t a cultural fascination. In this country, race has long been the excuse for barriers to a person’s ability to take care of themselves and their families. When identity becomes weaponized as an excuse for blocking access, we are not the America we aspire to be.\n\nCreating divides by pretending differences are distractions is just one small part of what Trump and the Republican Party seek to accomplish with their flurry of executive orders. The administration has flooded the zone with a barrage of policy changes to distract the American people from what it means to cancel a contract with a service-disabled veteran or make a lactation room a violation of federal policy.\n\nSo if Americans want to fight back, we must pay attention. We must differentiate between what is shock and awe and what is meaningful action. Part of Trump’s tactical toolbox is chaos and cacophony. He makes so much noise that you forget to look at what he’s actually doing — that’s why I call him a flimflam artist. The pain and harm he causes is real and we should never diminish that, but we also can’t give him more credit than he’s due.\n\nFor example, despite what Trump says about birthright citizenship, the president cannot rescind a constitutional amendment with an executive order. Something like that can’t happen unless we allow it to happen. And simply because your particular identity isn’t under attack, do not be fooled. You might be next. Right now, we have systems in place to stop our nation from restoring its original sins, but Trump has weakened our faith in our systems and each other.\n\nAmerica doesn’t simply exist by wishing and hoping, our systems of laws and customs exist by intention. My advice for Democrats is not to just talk about resistance, but also demonstrate insistence. We have to insist on recognizing our common humanity, our bounty of differences, our system of government and our work that has yet to be done. And we have to insist on our politicians doing their jobs to protect us all.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A combat veteran fired from his job at the IRS. Another vet fired from a job at the Veterans Administration. An architect who was restoring George Washington’s office at Valley Forge, also fired. The mother of a child with cystic fibrosis who has benefited from medical research conducted at the National Institutes of Health. A patient terrified that Congress will cut the Medicaid that allows her to get treatment for her breast cancer.\n\nThese are some of the guests Democratic members of Congress are taking to President Donald Trump’s address Tuesday night, people whose experiences tell a very different story from the one Trump wants to tell. For a change, Democrats are sending exactly the right message to the public, even if their megaphone isn’t as large as Trump’s: When you eviscerate the federal government, real people get hurt.\n\nTrump’s speech will undoubtedly paint a picture of a transformed America, returned at last to its lost greatness. While this isn’t technically a State of the Union address, it should encourage Democrats to remind voters of reality.\n\nThey need to point Americans to the objective facts and encourage them to take a good, hard look at what the actual state of our union is, especially as it has changed in the six weeks since Trump took office.\n\nThe mass firings of federal workers ordered by the Trump administration’s Elon Musk-led (but not officially) “Department of Government Efficiency” have begun what will most likely be the largest single round of government layoffs in American history, creating the risk of touching off a recession as the impact of job losses spreads through communities around the country. Trump is also about to impose 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and increase tariffs on Chinese goods, which is almost certain to fuel more price increases. That may be part of the reason consumer confidence is dropping. And we all know how expensive eggs have gotten.\n\nThat’s just the beginning.\n\nDemocrats also have an opportunity to be the party that stands in opposition to cutbacks that will make us all more vulnerable to corruption and abuse.\n\nDemocrats must take the opportunity to shine light on how Musk’s rampage through federal agencies will most likely result in a degradation of both taxpayer-facing services and key government functions. The administration will be firing thousands of workers at the Social Security Administration and plans to close many of the offices that provide customer service to beneficiaries (Musk recently called the incredibly popular program a “Ponzi scheme,” an extraordinary gift to Democrats). As Americans start preparing their tax returns, thousands of workers at the IRS are also on the chopping block, most likely producing worse customer service and slower processing of returns.\n\nIn the heart of flu season and amid a deadly new measles outbreak, the Food and Drug Administration canceled its annual meeting to determine next year’s flu vaccine, potentially damaging our response to the next round of infections. Warnings are coming in that the mass layoffs will threaten our ability to fight wildfires, prevent new epidemics and deliver basic services that millions of Americans rely on.\n\nDemocrats also have an opportunity to be the party that stands in opposition to cutbacks that will make us all more vulnerable to corruption and abuse.\n\nThe administration has dropped multiple cases against financial firms being investigated for misleading consumers and engaging in various kinds of misbehavior as part of its gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, giving a green light to scammers everywhere to prey on people. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is preparing to cut off most of the funding for the enforcement of fair housing laws. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department has stopped enforcement of a rule meant to make it more difficult to launder money and set up phony shell companies, and it has all but shut down oversight of the crypto industry. What could go wrong?\n\nThen, Democrats should make the case to America that there’s foreseeable long-term damage — which will become visible only over time.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, the engine of America’s world-leading medical research, has stopped issuing new grants and is in a general state of chaos. Internship programs in a wide variety of agencies that recruit talented young people to government service have been canceled. The administration is doing everything in its power to crush the development of renewable energy and increase carbon emissions, potentially worsening the effects of climate change. And Trump plans to cut the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 65%, the probable result of which will be dirtier air and water.\n\nIf that weren’t enough, the government could shut down in less than two weeks.\n\nAs horrifying as all that may be, there’s another, more hopeful story taking shape — and Democrats should be making Americans aware of it, as well.\n\nDemocrats should make the case to America that there’s foreseeable long-term damage — which will become visible only over time.\n\nPeople are rising up to oppose what Trump and Musk are doing: Fired federal workers are organizing to educate the public about how the government serves them and what is being lost, demonstrators are assembling in national parks around the country to protest cuts to the National Park Service, constituents are flocking to town halls to express their anger at Republican representatives who support the brutal cuts to federal staff and services that the administration is carrying out.\n\nThere is a grassroots movement forming, and only some of it is coming from liberal activists; it also includes people who may have voted for Trump because they were mad about inflation and never thought he’d cut off disease research or fire their neighbors. Democrats should get behind that movement — and know that if they don’t, they could face their own backlash from voters who want them to meet the moment.\n\nIt would be a mistake to think the damage from this effort to decimate the government won’t be awful. But perhaps when it’s over, more Americans will appreciate the value the federal workforce brings to all our lives. They may even learn that the military veterans who enjoy nearly universal esteem make up around 30% of federal workers, despite representing only 6% of the adult population (the federal government gives preference to veterans in hiring, a form of affirmative action even Republicans support).\n\nDemocrats have been slow to respond to the carnage happening around them, stunned by the sheer audacity of Trump’s assault and unsure about what their message should be. But as they look around, they should see that people are not happy about the state of the union. Showing the public exactly who is being hurt by the destruction of government, which Trump’s address has given them the chance to do, is a good place to start.",

He proposed everything from a \"golden visa\" for the wealthy to a cryptocurrency reserve, but for now they remain just proposals.\n\nHere’s a mostly complete look at what the Trump administration has done over the last seven days:\n\n• Passed a House budget on party lines that could cut Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\n• Imposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada that went into effect on Tuesday.\n\n• Scrambled to rehire staffers with the Food & Drug Administration who monitor the safety of medical devices.\n\n• Proposed a \"gold card\" visa that would allow people to become lawful permanent residents for $5 million.\n\n• Criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face in a shockingly contentious White House meeting.\n\n• Slashed staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, fulfilling a Project 2025 goal.\n\n• Announced the White House would take control of a press pool run by journalists for more than a century.\n\n• Announced that it would strip security clearances from a white-shoe law firm for working with former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\n• Announced that the Treasury Department will no longer enforce an anti-money laundering law.\n\n• Began planning a nationwide operation to potentially deport children who came into the U.S. without a parent or guardian.\n\n• Proposed that the U.S. government purchase and hold cryptocurrencies in a \"Crypto Strategic Reserve.\"\n\n• Said, through the Health and Human Services secretary, that measles deaths are \"not unusual,\" though the U.S. hasn't had one since 2015.\n\n• Wrote an unusual op-ed for Fox News in which the HHS secretary said the measles vaccine should be \"readily accessible for all those who want them.\"\n\n• Reportedly moved to cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to overhaul air traffic control systems and give it to Musk’s Starlink.\n\n• Made plans for large-scale layoffs at federal agencies in March and April in a memo calling the federal workforce \"bloated\" and \"corrupt.\"\n\n• Floated a plan to put tariffs on copper as part of a move to hurt China's growth in the sector.\n\n• Threatened to put 25% tariffs on the European Union, claiming, inaccurately, that the economic bloc was formed \"to screw\" the U.S.\n\n• Filed three bills to impeach judges who ruled against the Trump administration in recent weeks.\n\n• Invited billionaire federal contractor Elon Musk to Trump’s first Cabinet meeting, although he is not a member of the Cabinet.\n\n• Said at that Cabinet meeting that the country has \"gotten bloated and fat and disgusting.\"\n\n• Denied access to The Associated Press, Reuters, HuffPost and a German newspaper at the Cabinet meeting.\n\n• Revealed, after refusing to answer for weeks, that federal worker Amy Gleason is nominally the head of the DOGE effort.\n\n• Floated removing government spending from gross domestic product (GDP) reports, complicating any analysis of DOGE cuts.\n\n• Floated a controversial budget maneuver that would let Congress say that Trump's tax cut bill cost nothing, instead of trillions.\n\n• Posted a video on Truth Social that showed the Gaza Strip as a resort featuring gold statues of Trump.\n\n• Threatened to sue journalists who use anonymous sources or off-the-record quotes in news articles and books.\n\n• Blamed, without evidence, \"paid 'troublemakers'\" for Republican lawmakers facing tough questions at town hall meetings.\n\nSubscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates on and expert insight into the key issues and figures defining his second term.",

        "content": "Mega-billionaire Elon Musk has posted a “wall of receipts” online that he claims shows how much money he has saved taxpayers with his cost-slashing “Department of Government Efficiency” operation. But it turns out that ledger is riddled with massive amounts of misinformation and inaccuracies that dramatically exaggerate — or, to put it less charitably, deceive — the public about how much money Musk’s “efficiency” initiative is saving.\n\nMusk said on his wall of receipts that DOGE saved $8 billion from a single canceled contract at the Department of Homeland Security. It turned out that contract was for just $8 million. A listed $1.9 billion cut at the Treasury Department actually took place under President Joe Biden. An Associated Press analysis found that 40% of contracts cut by DOGE aren’t expected to save the government any money, according to the administration’s own data.\n\nMusk is being efficient, if one takes the view that he is more interested in destroying things than building things in the government.\n\nMusk is also quietly scrapping some of the false information that he posts, but without any kind of acknowledgment of inaccuracy. The New York Times points out that the original top five items listed on the “wall of receipts” have been deleted after scrutiny from reporters revealed they were incorrect. Among other things, those items included three $655 million cuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development that was actually a single cut that was counted three times, and a $232 million cut at the Social Security Administration that turned out to actually be a much smaller $560,000 project. While these items have been removed from the list, the total listed savings have only grown — but without any clear explanation of how.\n\nMusk’s wall of receipts also showcases yet another example of how farcical it is to say DOGE is about making the government run “efficiently.” As NBC News reports, the wall of receipts lists dozens of blanket purchase agreements, or BPAs, on its list of canceled spending. But BPAs aren’t actual orders; they’re “more like a catalog of things the government might buy,” as NBC News explains. Listing BPAs exaggerates canceled spending, because the money allocated for them wasn’t necessarily going to be spent.\n\nAnd, just as important, listing BPAs obscures the fact that they exist for the precise purpose of keeping costs down. They involve negotiated rates from vetted vendors for likely purchases — they’re arrangements for saving money and moving procurement more quickly. NBC News found that Musk listed at least $1 billion value in canceled contracts from BPAs. The BPA cancellations are a perverse two-for-one deal: they allow Musk to exaggerate savings and demonize the kinds of deals that would allow the government to save money.\n\nSome of this might seem somewhat counterintuitive. Every day there’s news about how DOGE is wreaking havoc on the federal workforce and its ability to administer services through cutbacks and mass firings.\n\nOn some level DOGE is having an extraordinary effect on the government. That’s all true. At the same time, it’s also true that Musk regularly peddles misinformation about what he’s doing and how much money he’s saving. In fact, even Musk’s non-credible topline claim of having saved $65 billion so far through DOGE cuts amounts to only about 0.9% of the 2024 federal budget.\n\nIn a way, Musk is being efficient, if one takes the view that he is more interested in destroying things than building things in the government. In a very short period of time with a very small team, he has done an extraordinary job of demoralizing and intimidating millions of federal workers and disabling the federal government’s ability to administer social services — particularly those seen as liberal. He's also very quickly shrouded some of the most basic elements of governance in a cloud of unreliable information, making it harder to hold him accountable.\n\nBut as far as making the government efficient or saving lots of money for taxpayers, this has the makings of a scam.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "It’s been four years since President Donald Trump last addressed a joint session of Congress, and you can bet that tonight’s speech will not focus on unifying our nation through measured, bipartisan policy proposals. Instead, I anticipate an address full of dubious bluster designed to elate his base, unnerve the left and deflect attention away from one of his most glaring broken promises thus far.\n\nMy educated guess is, generally, that we will be in for a long night. (I wouldn't be surprised if he surpasses President Bill Clinton's impressively long 90-minute State of the Union in 2000.)\n\nTo begin, I expect Trump to spend at least some time relitigating his last four years out of office.\n\nTo begin, I expect Trump to spend at least some time relitigating his last four years out of office. Think of this as the, “I was wronged” portion of the evening. This is where he is likely to go off the prompter and attack former President Joe Biden, rant about the Department of Justice and insult former special counsel Jack Smith. At the end of this section, look for some sort of mention of retribution.\n\nThen, I predict, he will transition to achievements from his first six weeks in office, especially on the topic of immigration. According to early data, illegal border crossings along the U.S. border with Mexico have dropped dramatically, a legitimately big win for the Trump administration and something he will absolutely emphasize.\n\nElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is also a key part of Trump’s 100 days agenda, albeit a much murkier one. There are many questions swirling around the amount of savings actually achieved by DOGE, and its inexcusable, sloppy firings of federal employees. But Trump isn’t going to acknowledge any of that, of course. Expect him instead to tout Musk’s crusade against government waste — real or imagined — as he did at CPAC a couple of weeks ago.\n\nOn the foreign policy front, our “America First” president will be unable to avoid discussing the very public White House blowup he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week. Again, the base seems to love Trump’s chest-thumping bravado, but keep an eye out for any Republicans tempering their applause.\n\nTrump loves to threaten his perceived rivals, and the Ukrainian debacle has given him a whole new reason to go after the European Union and our allies abroad. Zelenskyy was welcomed with open arms by European leaders over the weekend, and there is very little doubt that Trump will take this as a snub. It’s even possible Trump will announce some new form of punishment, tied to NATO or tariffs.\n\nThat’s the kind of moment that the base loves but leaders on both sides of the party dread, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nTrump often said that he would start his Oval Office tenure on “day one” by lowering the price of groceries.\n\nWhich brings us to a topic I will be watching very closely: How Trump handles the economy. Once considered one of his biggest assets, this “kitchen table” issue is looking increasingly like a liability. According to a recent Reuters poll, “Americans who think the economy is on the wrong track rose to 53%” in mid-February, which is up from 43% at the end of January.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump often said that he would start his Oval Office tenure by lowering the price of groceries on “day one.” He even held a press event next to tables filled with food items — oddly focused on breakfast foods like cereal — to rally against the rising costs of food. These days, however, Trump is virtually silent on pricing, preferring to bring up DEI or transgender issues to deflect from his failure to reverse the trend.\n\nDistraction is a tried-and-true tactic for Trump, and distraction is what I’m expecting in spades. From impugning enemies to flirting with potential new trade wars, the more noise Trump generates, the harder it is to focus on any one issue. Like, for example, the very real cost of eggs.",

        "title": "Three weeks later, White House endorses Hegseth’s ‘rookie mistake’",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As Pete Hegseth prepared to become defense secretary, his many critics made a persuasive case that the former Fox News host was, among other things, wildly unprepared to lead the Pentagon. Soon after, he took steps that helped prove his detractors right.\n\nIn fact, it was just a few weeks ago when the hapless Pentagon chief declared publicly that it was “unrealistic” to think that after the war in Ukraine ends, Russia wouldn’t keep portions of Ukraine it took by force. He added that Ukrainian membership in NATO simply wouldn’t happen.\n\nThe comments were certainly in line with the Kremlin’s wishes — a familiar problem with this administration — but they were also immediately recognized as a dramatic misstep: Before negotiations on a possible peace plan even began, Hegseth was already giving Moscow what it wanted.\n\nThe mistake did not go unnoticed. Not only were U.S. allies taken aback, but Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, chided the defense secretary for making a “rookie mistake.”\n\nHegseth quickly tried to walk back his comments, though three weeks later, it appears his “rookie mistake” has become the White House’s official policy. Politico summarized White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz’s appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz on the ultimate cease-fire deal, on “State of the Union”: “This will clearly be some type of territorial concession for security guarantees going forward. ... This needs to be a permanent end, not a temporary end. This needs to be European-led security guarantees going forward. Part of that is Europe’s contribution to its own defense. ... And then, you know, let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves — what type of support we provide or not is to be negotiated. But one thing is clear: We do not see Ukraine being a member of NATO.”\n\nLet’s recap. In February, Hegseth said that Russia will be able to keep parts of Ukraine that it took by force, and now in March, the White House national security adviser said Ukraine will, as far as the Trump administration is concerned, have to make “some type of territorial concession” to Russia.\n\nIn February, Hegseth said that Ukrainian membership in NATO was effectively off the table, and now in March, the White House national security adviser said effectively the same thing.\n\nIn fact, Waltz managed to go further than Hegseth, telling a national television audience the administration isn’t sure whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy should remain as Ukraine’s leader. “We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war,” Waltz said. “And if it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy’s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands.”\n\nIn other words, the diplomatic work has hardly even begun, but as far as the White House is concerned, Ukraine should be prepared to reward Russia with territory, give up on NATO membership, and even prepare to choose a new president more in line with Donald Trump’s wishes.\n\nIt’s one thing for an amateur Cabinet secretary to make a “rookie mistake.” It’s something else for an administration to embrace the error as U.S. foreign policy.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "While President Donald Trump has made a point of going after drug cartels, the Mexican government says U.S. gunmakers should be held liable for violence caused by their weapons in Mexico. The Supreme Court is about to hear arguments over whether Mexico can press its novel $10 billion claim.\n\nIt’s not a Second Amendment case before the court, which has sided with gun rights in recent years, but Mexico might face a skeptical bench all the same Tuesday.\n\nThe legal questions presented to the justices are:\n\nWhether the production and sale of firearms in the U.S. are a “proximate cause” of alleged injuries to the Mexican government stemming from violence committed by Mexican drug cartels.\n\nAnd whether that production and sale amounts to “aiding and abetting” illegal firearms trafficking because firearm companies allegedly know that some of their products are unlawfully trafficked.\n\nRepresented by Noel Francisco, a former Trump solicitor general, the gunmakers argue that Mexico’s claim is too attenuated because it’s based on “an eight-step causal chain — peppered by independent criminal actors and derivative sovereign harms — to try to link the lawful production and sale of firearms within the United States to the chaos ravaging Mexico courtesy of its drug cartels.” On the aiding and abetting point, they say the lawsuit is simply a challenge to “routine business practices.”\n\nBut Mexico argues that the gunmakers “deliberately sell their firearms in large quantities to known red-flag dealers” and “cultivate a market for their firearms in Mexico through design and marketing decisions.” And rather than simply arguing against routine business practices, Mexico alleges the companies “engage in unlawful behavior by intentionally facilitating the unlawful export of their firearms into Mexico through red-flag dealers and abnormal sales.”\n\nThe companies appealed to the justices after they lost in the federal appeals court. In that ruling last year, a panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Mexico’s lawsuit wasn’t barred by a federal law that otherwise insulates the firearms industry. The panel noted that Mexico has strict gun laws but that gun violence increased there after the U.S. ended its assault weapons ban in 2004.\n\nMexico’s complaint — against seven manufacturers and one distributor — detailed “a steady and growing stream of illegal gun trafficking from the United States into Mexico, motivated in large part by the demand of the Mexican drug cartels for military-style weapons,” the appellate ruling recounted. In turn, Mexico says it has suffered increased costs for medical, mental health and other services for victims and their families; increased costs for law enforcement and its judicial system; and diminished property values and business revenues.\n\nEven the appellate ruling in Mexico’s favor emphasized that it was only deciding that that government’s case was legally sufficient to move forward at a preliminary stage of litigation, and that whether the country could ultimately support its claims “remains to be seen.” But ahead of Tuesday’s oral arguments in Washington, it remains to be seen whether Mexico’s case can move forward at all.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in Donald Trump’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This post is part of the digital companion series to Jen Psaki’s “The Blueprint,” a new podcast examining where Democrats stand after big losses in 2024 and how they can win again. Below is an adapted excerpt from the March 3 episode featuring former Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nWhen I reflect on November’s election, two glaring omissions are missing from the Democratic Party’s messaging: acknowledgment and empathy. The lesson Democrats should take away from Kamala Harris’ loss to Donald Trump is the importance of meeting people where they are emotionally. If Democrats don’t do that, their message isn’t going to stick.\n\nJust consider my home state of Ohio. Over the years, deindustrialization, globalization and automation have just compounded, leaving many Ohioans in a tough spot. What I wish the Democratic Party would have said to these voters is simple: “I know you’re hurting but it’s going to take a little time for us to right this ship.”\n\nIt’s time to start building the case for the American people. But that doesn’t mean Democrats should run around with hair on fire over every issue.\n\nThe country just went through a pandemic. Disinvestment and deindustrialization decimated entire communities. Democrats know that — that’s why they’ve passed massive bills and implemented policy to try to help, investing in infrastructure, chip manufacturing, wind and solar energy, batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nBut the Democratic Party also needs to be honest with the American people. There’s no quick solution here. There’s going to be a lot of bumps along the way so Democrats should tell voters, “We’re sorry but we’re going to do this as quickly as we can.”\n\nThat’s a message I believe Joe Biden could have successfully communicated to voters. When he was still the party’s nominee, I wish he could have just said to the American people: “Hang with me. Trust me. I’ve lived in communities like yours. I’ve seen this before. It’s going to take a while to fix but just give me a chance.”\n\nDemocrats should have acknowledged the tough spot a lot of Americans were in. They should have shown voters they’re empathetic. But we also can’t just look in the past and talk about what the Democratic Party should have done. Democrats in Congress have a real opportunity to right that ship and show voters what the party really stands for.\n\nThere’s an analog element to this, members should be holding town hall meetings as often as they can. They need to get on the local news. It’s time to start building the case for the American people. But that doesn’t mean Democrats should run around with hair on fire over every issue.\n\nConsider the Trump administration’s recent cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. During my time in Congress, I voted on foreign aid. I sat on the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee. I know the value of those programs and how they save the U.S. money in the long run. But I don’t think Democrats want the discussion to be about how they’re defending foreign aid while people in their districts are still trying to figure out how to make ends meet and buy a carton of eggs. Why take the bait on that? Haven’t Democrats learned?\n\nDemocrats don't want the discussion to be about how they’re defending foreign aid while people in their districts are still trying to figure out how to make ends meet.\n\nMy advice for Democrats is just that: Don’t take the bait on everything coming out of this White House. Sometimes the smartest strategy is just to play possum. As Democratic strategist James Carville recently suggested in a guest essay for the New York Times, maybe the most daring political maneuver Democrats could implement right now is to “roll over and play dead.”\n\nJust let people see what the Trump administration is doing, uninterrupted. Then Democrats can point and say, “Wait, Trump didn’t say he would do that during the campaign. Trump said he would fix the economy. So why is he so focused on Ukraine? Why is he proposing tax breaks for billionaires?”\n\nOnce voters start seeing that and feeling the impact of Trump’s policies — like a mother who lost her child care because of budget cuts — they will start to realize he’s not delivering on his promises. That’s when Democrats can acknowledge, empathize and recapture the narrative to show the American people what their party truly stands for.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "UPDATE (March 2, 2025, 10:45 p.m. ET): On Sunday night, \"Anora\" was named the year's best picture at the 2025 Academy Awards. The honor capped a night of wins for the acclaimed film, including best actress, best director and best original screenplay.\n\nOn the surface, Sean Baker’s “Anora,” which has been nominated for multiple Oscars and has already won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, doesn’t seem interested in the present political moment. For example, the film’s Russian and Russian American characters show no discernible awareness of a war started by Vladimir Putin in 2022. But upon closer inspection, the movie probes a timely subject: the superwealthy and how they bend and distort civil society to their selfish whims.\n\n“Anora” is many things at once. It’s a meditation on sex work, a theme Baker examines with ingenuity in films like “Starlet,” “Red Rocket” and “Tangerine.” It’s a genre-toggler — shifting between a farcical rom-com, a gangster movie and an indie flick. It’s also a handy introduction to oligarchs and the obscene power they wield over institutions and the lives of working-class people.\n\n“Anora” subverts the feel-good vibe that movies like “Pretty Woman” radiated when portraying sex workers and their “kindhearted” johns.\n\nAt first, “Anora” appears to be stampeding to what in earlier decades would have been its Hollywood ending. We watch an exotic dancer from the outer boroughs named Ani/Anora (Mikey Madison) practice her craft at the local strip club. Because she speaks some Russian, her manager introduces her to a patron named Vanya (played by Mark Eydelshteyn).\n\nCute and absurdly wealthy, 21-year-old Vanya takes an apparent shine to Ani. He invites her to accompany him from one bender to another. Ani, with tinsel in her hair, seems to like him too. Still, she negotiates her price on each cocaine-fueled outing. Soon they end up in Las Vegas, where assorted onlookers (and Sean Baker’s giddy camera work) celebrate their shotgun wedding as fireworks discharge above.\n\nBut then “Anora” subverts the feel-good vibe that movies like “Pretty Woman” radiated when portraying sex workers and their “kindhearted” johns. Hours after the Vegas wedding, Vanya’s disapproving Russian parents spring into action. None too pleased about their son’s marriage to “a prostitute,” they dispatch their local goon squad to annul the union. The goons are an Armenian Orthodox priest (Father Toros, played by Karren Karagulian) and his two enforcers Garnick (also Armenian, played by Vache Tovmasyan) and the Russian “gopnick,” or “street thug,” Igor (Yuriy Borisov).\n\nGarnick and Igor break into Vanya’s Mill Basin mansion, a location with its own real-life connection to oligarchy. Vanya flees the scene, leaving his bride behind to deal with the intruders. What follows is no longer comedy, but every woman’s nightmare.\n\nHaving grown up in South Brooklyn, permit me to say that Mikey Madison does a spot-on imitation of a very pissed-off resident of Brighton Beach. Terrified Ani resists the goons and a wild melee ensues. After screaming “rape” at the top of her lungs, she is gagged. Father Toros — not, I surmise, a pro-choice advocate in his ministerial capacity — informs Ani that he will arrange an abortion should that be necessary.\n\nWhere, oh where is Vanya? Our boy has scampered off to other benders. His lushery encompasses Everything We Talk About When We Talk About Toxic Man-boys. Inability to establish emotional intimacy? Check. Obsession with video games? Yup. Construing sex as a sort of sprint? That too. We soon learn how little he cares about his wife. It is only the sex worker, Ani, who behaves as if marriage is a sacrament.\n\nFor oligarchs, by contrast, nothing is sacred. Vanya’s parents so control the priest Toros that he abandons a baby’s baptism midceremony to heed their call. If religious leaders will always play ball with the wealthy, so will the judicial system. In one crucial scene, these Russian nationals use their well-compensated American lawyer to set up an emergency annulment hearing in a New York City courtroom — which is the wrong place to annul a Nevada marriage. Now we are headed to Las Vegas. So are Vanya’s parents, who recently alighted from their jet and were rapidly processed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nVanya’s mother, Galina (Darya Ekamasova), makes it very clear to Ani that she must agree to legally terminate her marriage (“You are getting on this plane [to Las Vegas] and you are getting divorce”). Failure to do so, she threatens gleefully, will result in legal destruction. Imagine that! A wealthy foreigner feels so flush with power that she can use the American legal system to bully a working-class citizen. Naturally, Galina insinuates that Ani will be physically harmed if she refuses to comply.\n\nAs they part, Galina calls Ani “a disgusting hooker.” Ani bites back: “Your son hates you so much, he married one to piss you off.” Finally, the verbal smackdown we have been craving. That’s the stuff! Make the oligarchs squirm, Ani!\n\nBut oligarchs, as it turns out, don’t squirm. Ani’s sick burn immediately elicits uncontrollable laughter from Galina’s husband (Aleksey Serebryakov). His Papa Karamazov cackle, at once nihilistic and demented, reminds us of a truism: The superrich find all of this human suffering stuff fantastically funny.\n\n“Anora’s” final scene, which has been widely analyzed and debated, switches to art house mode. Ani initiates sex in a car with the “gopnik” Igor. She then breaks down and sobs over his supine body (the masculinity of the silent and supportive Igor might be usefully contrasted to Vanya’s loud, party-boy antics). The credits roll to the accompaniment of the loudest windshield wipers in the history of cinema.\n\nMadison and Baker insist that the meaning of this cryptic scene is up to the viewer. With that interpretive license granted, permit me to advance my own. Yes, Ani is likely crying over the betrayal, violence and feelings of powerlessness she’s endured. But in light of “Anora’s” portrait of the elite, maybe we could think of this sobbing woman as us — the U.S., weeping over what the wealthiest people in the world are doing to Americans.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "After watching the Oval Office exchange on Friday between President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance and their invited guest, Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy — I’m feeling some unusually visceral thoughts about my country. Betrayal, anger, embarrassment. Shame.\n\nTrump and Vance’s display in the Oval Office presented America to the rest of the world in a dramatically shameful light.\n\nWe already know the post-World War II order is over. The U.S. voted against its allies — and with the dictatorships of North Korea and Belarus — at the United Nations this week, opposing a resolution condemning Russia for invading Ukraine and occupying about 20% of its land. We’ve already heard Trump praise Russian President Vladimir Putin (many times) and call Zelenskyy a “dictator.” At a Cabinet meeting this week, Trump dismissed pleas from our NATO allies, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, to provide a “backstop” security guarantee in Ukraine, saying, “We’re going to have Europe do that.”\n\nBut Trump and Vance’s display in the Oval Office presented America to the rest of the world in a dramatically shameful light, making it plain that our government is no longer a worthy ally to liberal democracies around the world.\n\nZelenskyy expressed his appreciation to Trump for what he described as a “first step toward real security guarantees” for Ukraine, while also insisting there should be “no compromises” with the “killer” and “terrorist” Putin. Shortly after, Trump said that Zelenskyy ought to be more “grateful” and that his “hatred” for Putin makes it “tough to make a deal.”\n\nDeclaring himself a peacenik, Trump wrongly claimed his position — which is essentially to pre-emptively hand over Ukraine’s bargaining chips at the negotiating table, give Putin whatever he wants and take him at his word that he won’t reinvade — is more in line with Europe and the world’s sentiments than Zelenskyy’s.\n\nTrump, typically incoherent, rambled and repeated himself, so his vice president helpfully stepped in, saying Putin invaded Ukraine because then-President Joe Biden was weak and “the path to peace and prosperity is diplomacy.”\n\nZelenskyy, armed with facts to counter Vance’s MAGA rhetoric, noted that Putin first invaded Ukraine in 2014 (Trump incorrectly tried to correct him, saying it was 2015), and that he occupied Crimea and had been aggressing on Ukrainian territory ever since, including the four years of Trump’s first term. He also noted that Putin’s brutal 2022 invasion was itself a violation of a previous ceasefire — bringing further absurdity to the idea that Putin’s promises for “peace” can be trusted.\n\nThat was when Vance went into attack poodle mode, scolding Zelenskyy as “disrespectful” for trying to litigate the matter (i.e. telling the truth with verifiable facts) in front of the American media. Vance barked that he should be thanking Trump and not attacking the administration that is “trying to prevent the destruction of your country.”\n\nZelenskyy, remarkably, kept his cool, trying to get in a word over the shouts of Trump and Vance, warning them that even though the U.S. has an ocean between itself and Europe, that the country would “feel” the consequences of capitulating to Russia “in the future.”\n\nThat’s when it completely went off the rails.\n\nVance went into attack poodle mode, scolding Zelenskyy as ‘disrespectful’ for trying to litigate the matter (i.e. telling the truth with verifiable facts) in front of the American media.\n\nTrump bellowed, “You’re gambling with World War III” and attempted to humiliate Zelenskyy by saying “you don’t have the cards.” (The Ukrainian president replied that he’s not playing cards, he’s fighting a war.) Trump did a mock impersonation of Zelenskyy saying, “I don’t want a ceasefire!” Vance said Zelenskyy should have raised his objections in private and not in front of the media, adding, “We know that you’re wrong.”\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump what would happen if Putin broke a future ceasefire, the leader of the free world replied, “What if a bomb drops on your head right now?” before going on another incoherent rant about how Putin himself had suffered through the “phony witch hunt” and blamed the “Russia Russia Russia” investigation on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and “shifty Adam Schiff.”\n\nHe then turned to Zelenskyy and said, “I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States,” adding that if he doesn’t “make a deal” with Putin — the U.S. is “out.” Then Trump abruptly ended the press conference, noting “this is going to be great television.” As reporters were shunted out of the room, Vance reassuringly patted his boss on the arm.\n\nMinutes after the meeting ended, Trump posted to his social media site Truth Social: “I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” Trump also reportedly kicked Zelenskyy out of the White House.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Russia’s nominal president during the four years from 2008-12 when Putin pretended he wasn’t actually in power, posted to X: “The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is ‘gambling with WWIII.’”\n\nThose few minutes in the Oval Office are destined for the history books as a catastrophic and disgraceful moment in the story of America.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio — who sat silently next to Vance during the Oval Office fiasco — in February 2022 tweeted: “The people of #Ukraine are tough people who will NEVER accept being ruled by #Putin … Men, women, children, the elderly, they are going to fight … And they are going to maim & kill alot [sic] of Russians.” Now that he works for Trump, Rubio posted this on Friday: “Thank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before.”\n\nI’m not one for extensive self-flagellating over America’s many flaws. There are sins committed by this country’s government and its people, both recent and historic, that can never be fully atoned for — but which we should always be working to understand and strive to never repeat. Still, I don’t walk around life thinking the United States is irredeemable. ​​Far from it, actually. On the ledger of history and in broad terms, I believe we’ve been more right than we’ve been wrong.\n\nAnd yet, those few minutes in the Oval Office are destined for the history books as a catastrophic and disgraceful moment in the story of America.\n\nOur president, for almost a century known as the “Leader of the Free World,” has abandoned that post. We, as represented by our government, offer support only in mafia-esque transactional terms (“You give us your nation’s natural resources, and we’ll protect you, maybe”). Our leaders parrot the propaganda of an imperialist dictator who has acted as one of America’s primary adversaries over the past two and a half decades. And a democratic ally that has miraculously survived an existential attack by its nuclear-armed neighbor for three years was humiliated on the world stage and essentially blamed for fighting back against Putin’s aggression.\n\nMost perversely, the president’s admirers call this “diplomacy” and acting toward “peace.”\n\nIt’s too soon to say “we’re the bad guys,” but it’s not at all too soon to say “we’re on the side of the bad guys” — and historic alliances and mutual values mean nothing to us anymore. The “shining city on a hill” is a gangster’s paradise. It’s a shameful day for America.",

        "title": "The 'No Other Land' Oscars speech accomplished a remarkable feat",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Sunday's best documentary Oscar winner was surprising for a few notable reasons: “No Other Land,” a film co-directed by Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers, covers the forced expulsions of Palestinians from their homes in the occupied West Bank from a vantage point largely unexplored in the world of U.S.-focused Western cinema. Both the win itself and the acceptance speeches were rare and powerful moments, when a harsh worldly reality inserted itself into an affair that is by nature performative, even self-indulgent.\n\nThe win is even more noteworthy given the filmmakers haven’t been able to find a distributor to work with them in the United States, and yet it has grossed more than any of the other Oscar-nominated documentaries this year.\n\nWhile some rose in standing ovation, many attendees looked visibly nervous about what to clap for.\n\nThe documentary tells the story of Palestinians in Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in Hebron, being violently and systematically expelled through intimidation, from destroying water sources and other threats to assassinations. The film shows, among other devastating acts of violence, Palestinian co-director Basel Adra’s brother being killed.\n\nAdra and Israeli Yuval Abraham, two of the four co-directors, spoke in accepting the award. Adra and his family are from Masafer Yatta.\n\n“About two months ago, I became a father, and my hope to my daughter is that she will not have to live the same life I am living now, always fearing violence, home demolitions, forced displacement that my community, Masafer Yatta, is facing every day,” Adra said in his Sunday speech. “‘No Other Land’ reflects the harsh reality we have been enduring for decades and still resist as we call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.”\n\nAbraham added: “We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger. We see each other. The atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end; the Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of Oct. 7, which must be freed.”\n\nThe discomfort in the room was palpable. Practically no one clapped in response to Abraham’s comment about the destruction of Gaza and its people — to date over 46,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed, many of whom are women and children — whereas his comment about bringing Israeli hostages home was met with uproarious applause.\n\nNevertheless, Abraham persisted with his message:\n\n“When I look at Basel, I see my brother. But we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military laws that destroy lives, that he cannot control. There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people.\n\n“And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path. Why? Can’t you see that we are intertwined? That my people can be truly safe if Basel’s people are truly free and safe? There is another way. It’s not too late for life, for the living.”\n\nWhile some rose in standing ovation, many attendees looked visibly nervous about what to clap for.\n\nEven if for just a few moments, Adra and Abahams accomplished a remarkable feat: They forced attendees and viewers at home to confront a reality that so many Palestinians continue to face. Some in attendance may have chosen not to clap, but those who watched couldn’t escape acknowledging a reality so many have attempted to belittle or deny.",

        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the Feb. 28 episode of \"Chris Jansing Reports.\"\n\nOn Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump met at the Oval Office to finalize the details of a minerals deal both parties agreed to earlier this week. This deal would grant the United States access to some of Ukraine’s critical minerals. Both sides entered the meeting feeling confident it was a good deal for both countries. But, instead of discussing that deal, the conversation quickly devolved into a shouting match, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance repeatedly accusing the Ukrainian leader of not being grateful enough to the United States.\n\nThat meeting was horrific. It was a tragedy for American national security interests, and it did neither side any good. Trump and Vance’s confrontation with Zelenskyy doesn’t make the American people any better off tomorrow than they were today. The only winner of this spat was Vladimir Putin. Russian officials and commentators close to the Kremlin are downright likely giddy about the outcome.\n\nTrump and Vance’s confrontation with Zelenskyy doesn’t make the American people any better off tomorrow than they were today.\n\nVance pleaded for the leader of another country to pledge his fealty to Trump and say thank you. But Zelenskyy didn’t need that reminder. Time and time again, he has thanked the U.S. and the American people for their contributions in helping Ukraine fight against unprovoked Russian aggression. It is also worth noting the vice president voted against aid to Ukraine during his time in Congress, so I’m not quite sure why he believes he should be thanked. Trump’s Republican Party also delayed approving the last package of assistance for six months, a delay that resulted in many Ukrainian soldiers dying on the battlefield.\n\nInstead of focusing on the present — what is good for American national interests today — Trump also felt compelled to relitigate his past.\n\nTrump and Vance’s performance was a distraction from the intended goal of Friday’s meeting. The deal Zelenskyy and Trump were supposed to sign was good for the United States and good for Ukraine. But instead of signing that deal, Trump ranted on about the past and criticized former President Joe Biden’s handling of the war and stretched back to his past grievances about other American politicians to 2016, complaining again about what he called the Russia hoax. (In 2016, Putin's intelligence services stole emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign and then published them with the aim of trying to influence the outcome of that election. The Justice Department later published a report on Russia's interference.)\n\nThe president should prioritize the country’s interests and stop reliving the past. What we saw in the Oval Office on Friday was not in America’s best interest.\n\nMoving forward, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his team should attempt to get U.S.-Ukraine relations back on track with their Ukrainian diplomatic counterparts, including signing the minerals deal and working to negotiate an enduring and just end to this horrific war. And they should do so behind closed doors, not in the Oval Office with cameras rolling.",

        "title": "Trump’s tariffs are finally upon us — and Americans are nervous",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In recent weeks, the Trump administration’s economic policy agenda and the way that agenda is being implemented has spooked consumers, businesses, and investors. The so-called “soft data” — polls and sentiment surveys — reveal a distinctly downward drift in people’s feelings about Trump’s tariffs, DOGE’s layoffs and budget cuts, and the lack of attention to pre-existing stressors such as grocery and housing prices.\n\nThe most recent Consumer Confidence survey took a 6.7% nosedive in February, its biggest drop since August 2021. The index that specifically tracks respondents’ expectations as to where things might be headed fell even faster, down 11.3%. These monthly data tend to be noisy, but they’re backed up by a lot of other data. One consistent finding is that people think tariffs are going to create new price pressures (and, as I previously wrote, they’re right). A Washington Post-Ipsos poll found that “about 7 in 10 Americans think tariffs generally increase the price of products in the United States.” Other data show a 19% plunge in how consumers view buying conditions for big-ticket items, again because of beliefs that tariffs will soon raise prices.\n\nConsumers are nervous, and so are businesses and investors.\n\nGranted, there’s been more bluffing on tariffs than actual tariffs put in place, but that can only go on for so long before the bluffs lose any credibility. Which is perhaps why President Trump now says new tariffs of 25% on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada will take effect this week, plus an additional 10% on China.\n\nThe upshot is that consumers are nervous, and so are businesses and investors, due to the sharp rise in uncertainty about where relevant policy and government actions — trade policy, layoffs of federal workers, cutting of public spending and private contracts — are headed. Trade policy uncertainty is at its highest level since the first Trump administration, according to an index developed by economists Scott Baker, Nick Bloom and Steven Davis (although, as Stephen Cobert said last week, “can you ever really know where you are on the uncertainty index?”).\n\nBut what impact does this all have on the real economy, meaning jobs, incomes, and business investments? After all, during the Biden administration, we lived through years of bad vibes but strong growth, especially consumer spending.\n\nIn fact, the so-called “hard data” — jobs, GDP, unemployment — still look good, but there are worrying signs, with one in particular catching my attention. I’ll get to that indicator in a moment, but first let’s be clear that it takes a lot of bad policy (or bad luck, or bad financial or housing bubbles) to reverse the fortunes of an almost $30 trillion economy comprised of 340 million people. Trump inherited an economy that was reliably growing based on a simple, solid formula: The strong labor market, in tandem with easing inflation, was and is generating real wage gains that support consumer spending, which, at 68% of the US economy, is the biggest portion of GDP. At the same time, business investors have been pretty active, investing in technology, especially AI, but also, encouraged by Biden-era incentives, in domestic production of computer chips and clean energy.\n\nThat said, at the end of last week we learned about one hard indicator that may portend trouble: real consumer spending fell by 0.5% in January. That’s just one month in a noisy data series, January was unusually cold, which can dampen some spending (though not online spending, of course), and spending at the end of last year was strong, so maybe this is just a pause.\n\nBut maybe it isn’t. Spending on big ticket items—“durable goods”—was sharply down in January after strong months in November and December. That suggests consumers, worried about the price impact of the tariffs, tried to get ahead of them at the end of 2024.\n\nBusinesses are clearly concerned — and they know who to blame.\n\nSimilarly, because DOGE layoffs have the potential to hit the earnings of hundreds of thousand of federal workers and private contractors, it would make sense for them to precautionarily save right now. And indeed the January savings rate spiked up by more than a percentage point, a big jump for one month.\n\nBusinesses are clearly concerned — and they know who to blame. A new survey by S&P Global Businesses reports that “firms widely blamed lower sales and activity levels on uncertainty and instability surrounding new government policies in the US, including federal spending cuts and tariff-related developments.”\n\nIt’s not just the private sector feeling uncertain either: Pennsylvania, for example, had $2.1 billion in federal funding frozen or placed under review. After the administration restored the funding, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said, “The federal government entered into agreements with state government agencies to get those dollars out into people’s communities. Those agreements are binding. To put it simply: A deal is a deal.”\n\nYet what if a deal isn’t a deal? What does that do to an economy wherein business, state and local governments, and working families need to plan ahead? Those aren’t rhetorical questions: This degree of uncertainty, coupled with the inflationary impacts of sweeping tariffs, is toxic for sentiment and confidence first, followed by investment, jobs and growth next. It’s too early to know if we’re heading in that dark direction. But there are clear signs for concern.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "I was preparing dinner, as my wife, my 18-year-old son, Nico, and his developmental therapist sat in the family room. Nico is autistic and has Down syndrome; he communicates beautifully with sounds, signs, tech and actions, but each mode requires a lot of work, and it’s only in recent years that he’s begun to make real gains in verbal speech.\n\nSo, as I chopped vegetables and listened to a podcast, they were working on using an app that would say words out loud to prompt Nico’s verbal utterances. Suddenly, my wife called to me, telling me to listen as Nico pressed the screen and made the tablet said, “My dad’s name is David.” I stopped chopping and turned off the podcast. Nico smiled, and prompted by the therapist, verbally said, “Day-ve.” That was good enough for me, but the therapist reminded him to say the final “d,” pointing to it on the screen. Nico looked mischievous as he took a moment to do the full motor planning, his jaw and tongue twitching behind closed lips. Then, he said, “Day-vi-duh.”\n\nAs the first month of the Trump administration comes to a close, attacks on disabled people are emerging on all fronts.\n\nI teared up. I had never heard him say my name. I’m tearing up now as I write this.\n\nThese kinds of moments don’t just happen. They take work, mostly from my son, but also from family, friends, teachers, therapists, doctors, aides and others. That support system has been forged from a combination of laws and government-funded programs that guarantee my son’s rights, provide him resources and offer him opportunities.\n\nThe laws are federal. Much of the funding for the programs are federal. This infrastructure has generally enjoyed broad bipartisan support over the past few decades — until now. When it comes to work, communication, education and health care, not to mention basic human dignity, the Trump administration is ready to abandon kids like my son.\n\nAs the first month of the Trump administration comes to a close, attacks on disabled people are emerging on all fronts. The new “Make America Healthy Again” campaign reads as a targeted attack against support for conditions such as autism or mental illness, not to mention chronic diseases of all sorts. As they did during the last Trump regime, Republicans are seeking to gut Medicaid. Looming closures of Social Security Administration offices around the country will make it much harder for recipients of disability insurance and benefits under the program to apply, get approved and contest denials.\n\nThen there is the Education Department. Though the Senate confirmed Trump’s nominee for education secretary, Linda McMahon, by a 51-45 vote Monday, the White House is still attempting to abolish the department by executive order. For decades, federal funding has been absolutely crucial for special education programs. The Office of Civil Rights in the department provides the means for disabled students and their families to demand accountability and compliance with the law. Terminating the department could also accelerate the devolution of public education into state voucher programs for private schools, which are not legally required to accept disabled students. Even if the department survives, there’s no reason to think McMahon is committed to — or even understands — her department’s critical role in protecting access to education.\n\nI always am eager to look at policy and how it impacts people’s lives, but this story about the collapse of a great bipartisan consensus around disability extends beyond policymakers in Washington. Attacks on disabled Americans and the policies we rely on lie at the core of so much of MAGA culture.\n\nBy chance, the day before Nico said my name, Trump held a press conference about the horrific collision of an army helicopter and a commercial airliner in Washington that killed all 67 passengers and crew. He opened by talking about disability, saying you need to be a “special genius” in order to be an air traffic controller, but then blamed the Federal Aviation Administration for a targeted disability hiring program that includes “hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism.”\n\nFor the record, disabled workers had nothing to do with the crash. Also for the record, many disabled workers are entirely capable of being air traffic controllers. There are no controllers with intellectual disabilities, but plenty of people with other conditions can handle this high stress job as well as anyone else. The FAA, like most federal employers, has worked hard to live up to the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act and hire more disabled workers. It is, after all, not only federal law, but also a competitive advantage that is good for businesses.\n\nIf all this wasn’t enough, when conservatives yell on social media, they increasingly like to use the word “retard.” Trump used it at Joe Biden in the fall before his aides talked him out of it. In early January, Elon Musk tweeted it at a Finnish researcher who had criticized the billionaire. Subsequently, use of the slur tripled on his X platform. Musk now uses it all the time and it's spreading beyond social media.\n\nThis particular right-wing assault on a marginalized population is new. In 2012, conservative pundit Ann Coulter referred to President Barack Obama using that same offensive word, and faced backlash that was immediate, bipartisan and swept across the airwaves. When Fred Trump III, the president’s nephew, reached out to Republican leaders during the first Trump administration in order to shore up support for disabled people like his son, he found lots of allies. Normal Republicans want to help. Over the years, Republicans and Democrats have often disagreed about who counts as disabled and the amount of financial support these programs deserve, but they still preserved a basic consensus on the importance of the ADA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Medicaid.\n\nThis particular right-wing assault on a marginalized population is new.\n\nThose basic guardrails around work, education and health care are now broken. When Fred Trump III approached his uncle in the spring of 2020, the current president said it might be better if Fred’s son — the president’s grandnephew — just died. I believe it. At the FAA briefing the other day, the president talked about people who “suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website. Can you imagine? These are people that are … actually their lives are shortened because of the stress that they have.”\n\nThat’s false. The lives of people like my son are shortened because they don’t have health care. Because they can’t get jobs. Because they can’t find accessible housing. Because when a wildfire rages, no one communicates the threat in a way they can understand. And all of these threats can be ameliorated because the disability rights movement has — haltingly, with many setbacks and disagreements — forced or convinced politicians and policymakers to support basic human dignity. An insufficient but real enforcement mechanism can be found in nearly every federal agency, often located in civil rights wings. Alas, these are the very things now being gutted by the new administration.\n\nIt’s easy to miss the human side of policy, legal compliance, the nitty gritty of efficient government. To get caught up in slogans about fraud or waste. That’s what Musk and Trump are counting on right now as they install their vandals throughout the federal government. And yet my son said my name. I see, and hear, the human side every time my son says “Hi, Daddy!” or now even, “My dad’s name is David.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last week, House Republicans adopted their budget resolution, the first step toward enacting a bill that would kick millions off Medicaid and cut food assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to a meager $1.67 per meal for the typical recipient on average — all while providing an average tax cut of $278,000 to the top 0.1% and adding trillions of dollars to the national deficit.\n\nThere are still many steps left in this budgetary process, but House Republicans aim to use a procedure known as budget reconciliation, which allows the Senate to pass legislation with only 51 votes rather than the usual 60 required. In practical terms, this means Republicans can pass this budget without bipartisan support. In political terms, it means Republicans alone own this budget.\n\nWe know the true targets of this budget resolution.\n\nUnderstandably, there has been strong public pushback against a bill that would rip food and health care away from struggling households while enriching the wealthiest. In response, the refrain from GOP supporters of the budget resolution, again and again, has been to pretend that the resolution isn’t cutting Medicaid.\n\nSure, many House Republicans have said over and over they want to cut Medicaid and SNAP. But they claim they won’t do that. Instead, they say, this resolution merely directs the committees that oversee Medicaid and SNAP to cut spending. Wink, wink.\n\nPut simply, that’s a lie. Not only have House Republicans admitted their intentions, but the simple math of their budget resolution makes cutting these programs necessary.\n\nBudget resolutions create binding instructions for various committees to achieve certain deficit impacts, but those instructions are not and in fact must not be specific about how to achieve those impacts. In other words, while it’s true the instructions don’t specifically call out Medicaid and SNAP, that’s because they’re literally not allowed to mention Medicaid or SNAP.\n\nBut we know the true targets of this budget resolution, because the author — House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas — released a document in January specifying program cuts. And guess what that list featured: hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nRepublicans who support these cuts, even as they pretend the cuts don’t exist, won’t be able to maintain this fiction much longer.\n\nThe math the House voted to approve is also impossible without deep cuts to Medicaid and nearly impossible without cuts to SNAP. The budget resolution as passed instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find at least $880 billion in cuts from fiscal years 2025 through 2034. And it instructs the House Agriculture Committee to find at least $230 billion in cuts within the same window.\n\nThat deficit reduction must come from the programs the committees have jurisdiction over. Only around $500 billion of funding in the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction is not Medicare or Medicaid. If the advocates of this budget resolution aren’t cutting Medicare — which President Donald Trump has promised not to do — then there simply is not enough funding under the Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction to achieve $880 billion in deficit reduction without cutting Medicaid.\n\nThe House Agriculture Committee oversees $1.3 trillion in spending, of which SNAP makes up $1 trillion. It is mathematically possible to leave SNAP untouched — but it would require cutting everything else the committee oversees, on average, by 75 percent. Do you think House Republicans are going to cut all farm programs by 75 percent? Or do you think they’re cutting SNAP, as they’ve said they want to do countless times?\n\nRepublicans who support these cuts, even as they pretend the cuts don’t exist, won’t be able to maintain this fiction much longer. Right now, the House and the Senate are trying to come to an agreement on the budget resolution. At some point, they’ll have to write legislation rather than just a broad framework. And at that point, if the bill reflects what the House passed on Tuesday, the American public will see Republicans eviscerating health care and food assistance to help give tax cuts to millionaires.",

        "title": "Elon Musk said Social Security is a 'Ponzi scheme.' It's the opposite.",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Mega-billionaire and DOGE chief Elon Musk told Joe Rogan last week that he believes Social Security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” and suggested the program is wracked by fraud. That’s ironic coming from a plutocrat who is peddling false “savings” to provide cover for his project to hobble the federal government.\n\nIt was also ironic because Social Security is a highly functioning, universal and exceptionally efficient part of the American social safety net. It’s the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. Which is why the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose cutting it.\n\nThe only people in American politics who are likely to pull the rug out from under retirees is today’s Republican Party.\n\nIn a Ponzi scheme a scam artist lures investors into a fake investment project, pockets a lot of the cash and uses new “investors” to funnel cash to the older ones — until new recruits slow down and the whole thing collapses. Everyone is being lied to, and nobody is really getting returns on their investment.\n\nSocial Security, which has been around since the 1930s, is politically toxic to touch precisely because it does pay everybody out. It is not some kind of black box in which money sloshes around mysteriously but a simple “pay as you go” program, wherein current workers, via the payroll tax, fund payouts for retirees and disabled people. In 2024, about 1 in 5 U.S. residents received Social Security.\n\nAs the Social Security Administration explains, “In 2025, when you work, about 85 cents of every Social Security tax dollar you pay goes to a trust fund. This fund pays monthly benefits to current retirees and their families and to surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. About 15 cents goes to a trust fund that pays benefits to people with disabilities and their families.”\n\nAnd as the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities notes, in part because Social Security is universal and isn’t means-tested, it’s extremely cost-effective: Managing the program costs less than 1% of the revenue that funds the program.\n\nSocial Security isn’t unreliable — almost all retired Americans pay into it and draw from it. And, as the CBPP explains, Social Security is “most workers’ only source of guaranteed retirement income that is not subject to investment risk or financial market fluctuations.”\n\nMusk’s argument that Social Security is some kind of scheme to defraud the public rests in part on misinformation about dead people getting payouts. In the interview, Musk repeated a claim about tens of millions of people incorrectly being marked as “alive” in the Social Security database. But experts have debunked this claim by explaining that Musk has conflated Social Security number figures with actual beneficiaries and said there’s no evidence of widespread fraud. The SSA’s inspector general found in 2024 that only 0.84% of the trillions of dollars disbursed from 2015 to 2022 were improperly allocated. Most of those improper payments were overpayments, and some of them were recovered.\n\nThe other thing Musk cites as evidence that Social Security is a scheme are the numbers that show Social Security obligations exceed projected tax revenue. That’s true and universally acknowledged — and not remotely scandalous. With people living longer lives and the birth rate decreasing, there will need to be a change to Social Security funding in order to keep the program working at the level it currently works at. There are a number of strategies for dealing with this that have to do with changing the way taxes fund Social Security.\n\nThe only people in American politics who are likely to pull the rug out from under retirees is today’s Republican Party. Musk’s misinformation about Social Security, his and President Donald Trump’s constant claims that it needs to be probed for a nonexistent mass waste and fraud problems and massive cuts to the Social Security Administration’s workforce are themselves the red flags that should have American taxpayers who’ve paid into the system worried about being taken for a ride.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday night temporarily paused a looming deadline for the Trump administration to release more than $1.5 billion in foreign aid funding. Chief Justice John Roberts’ order was brief but still a major win for the White House in its effort to tear down the U.S. Agency for International Development. In coverage of and reaction to the Supreme Court’s ruling, one fact has gone underemphasized: The lower court order, which is now on hold, required the government to pay for work that has already been completed.\n\nThe administration’s withholding of that money represents a stunning disregard for contracts signed and executed in good faith. This culture of deliberate default on display can’t spring from nowhere — it must be encouraged and supported at the top. Given the history of the two men driving this rapid, and likely illegal, dismantling of USAID, it follows that President Donald Trump and Elon Musk see paying bills as merely an option that can be discarded.\n\nThe administration’s withholding of that money represents a stunning disregard for contracts signed and executed in good faith.\n\nSince Trump was inaugurated, USAID has been the most imperiled test subject of his administration’s mad experiment to consolidate control of the federal government. The foreign aid freeze that he signed on his first day immediately jeopardized thousands of projects and many more lives around the world. A lack of understanding of how federal payment systems work reportedly led Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to say they believed USAID workers were willfully skirting the freeze — and deserved to be made into an example.\n\nMusk tried to dodge blame for one of the “accidentally canceled” programs, claiming that DOGE quickly “restored” funding for Ebola prevention that USAID administers. Current and former USAID officials told The Washington Post that is false. In fact, most of the aid work USAID was doing remains paused. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered the administration to disburse funding that USAID had previously promised to pay contractors and grant recipients. When the State Department’s lawyers dithered in court Tuesday on whether that money had been released, the judge on Tuesday issued a follow-up order to have USAID pay up for work that had already been done prior to his initial Feb. 13 order. The Trump administration argued to the Supreme Court that there wasn’t enough time to carry out Ali’s order, leading to Roberts’ stay.\n\nPurposefully letting bills go unpaid is something that most Americans have been conditioned to regard as rightly punishable; it is only the rich who can afford to disregard paying their creditors. Over the years, Trump and Musk have both been accused of reneging on deals after already receiving the benefit of others’ labor.\n\nTrump and his companies have been subject to numerous legal actions from contractors and others accusing the real estate developer of welching on deals. “The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years,” USA Today reported in 2016. “In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.”\n\nAnother investigation that year from The Wall Street Journal found “a pattern over Mr. Trump’s 40-year career of his sometimes refusing to pay what some business owners said Trump companies owed them.” Trump told the Journal he paid “thousands of bills on time,” which is not the same as all of his bills. He likewise told Reuters in a separate inquiry about his business practices: “‘I’ve had many people that when they work for me they get very rich,’ Trump said … but, ‘sometimes I renegotiate.’ Adding: ‘I’ll do that with probably 10 or 15 percent of contractors.’”\n\nPurposefully letting bills go unpaid is something that most Americans have been conditioned to regard as rightly punishable; it is only the rich who can afford to disregard paying their creditors\n\nMusk’s companies have also been subject to similar complaints. Within four months of his takeover of Twitter (now dubbed X) in late 2022, six companies sued his new business over unpaid bills. After less than a year under Musk, the number of lawsuits over unpaid bills had grown to more than two dozen. “Suing X,” wrote Ars Technica’s Jon Brodkin, “seems to be the most effective method of collecting on unpaid invoices.”\n\nReuters also reported last year that based on a review of Texas property records, Musk’s rocket company SpaceX has been slow to pay bills for work done as it expands. Reuters noted at the time that it “couldn’t determine for every lien whether outstanding bills were owed by SpaceX or by one of its contractors who commissioned work or materials on its behalf,” and Musk has attacked Reuters’ reporting repeatedly via his X account. As with Trump, many of those cases involving Musk have been settled while others face ongoing, potentially very expensive, litigation.\n\nThe amount that Musk and Trump have been accused of not paying totals somewhere in the millions — but the federal contracts at play are measured in the billions. State Department lawyers blamed the delay in restoring that funding on the complexity of the system, claiming it couldn’t be turned back on like a spigot. But in the same filings, they also noted the administration is eliminating 90% of the contracts USAID administers and more than $60 billion in foreign assistance. In short, the Trump administration is arguing that the spigot is under its sole control, not the courts’ or Congress’, and effectively claiming the right to break legally binding contracts on a whim.\n\nBased on the sweeping and arbitrary cuts to staff and funding we’re seeing, USAID won’t be the only agency whose partners and contractors will be subject to this kind of capriciousness. It is entirely possible, though, that the work that still needs to be done in the areas where staffing has been cut and contracts ended will now be much more expensive in the long run. (Think about how Trump’s reported issues with paying his lawyers on time drove up the prices for those attorneys willing to still take him on as a client.)\n\nMusk and DOGE claim that decimating USAID will save taxpayers money and increase government efficiency. Growing doubts that the federal government will pay for services rendered will likely be seen as a bonus for the architects of this quest to fracture the administrative state. If anything, removing trust in government contracts will more likely lead to higher costs for taxpayers, as expensive contractors require upfront payments to ensure that the U.S. won’t simply leave them on the hook once the job is done.\n\nMoreover, blatantly disregarding USAID’s contracts poses a danger to the entire underpinning of our civil court system, which is built on the idea that contracts signed without duress are sacrosanct. Musk and Trump’s actions have suggested instead that for a powerful enough agent — be it a company or the federal government — there can be no enforcement, no accountability should they change their mind. For that reason alone, the Supreme Court’s hold cannot be allowed to stand on the merits, not if contracts are to have any weight of law.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Late last week, a publication called The Record, which focuses on news related to cybersecurity, published a report that seemed hard to believe. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the outlet reported, “ordered U.S. Cyber Command to stand down from all planning against Russia, including offensive digital actions.”\n\nTwo days later, Rep. Mike Turner, the former Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation” and was asked if the report was true. The Ohio congressman said he was “certain” that it had to be wrong.\n\n“I’m confident, considering what Russia is currently doing against the United States, that the United States, the status against Russia would not be that, considering what we are facing from Russia operations,” Turner added.\n\nI can appreciate why the GOP lawmaker was incredulous. The idea that the Trump administration would take such a step certainly appears absurd. And yet, NBC News reported that the reporting in The Record was correct.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said. Hegseth gave the order to the head of the command, Air Force Gen. Tim Haugh, in late February, the official said. It is unclear clear how long the order will last.\n\nA report in The New York Times, which cited additional sources, added, “[R]etaining access to major Russian networks for espionage purposes is critical to understanding Mr. Putin’s intentions as he enters negotiations, and to tracking the arguments within Russia about what conditions to insist upon and what could be given up.”\n\nThat access, at least for now, has been curtailed. It led Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to say in a written statement, “Donald Trump is so desperate to earn the affection of a thug like Vladimir Putin he appears to be giving him a free pass as Russia continues to launch cyber operations and ransomware attacks against critical American infrastructure, threatening our economic and national security.”\n\nThe New York Democrat added, “It is a critical strategic mistake for Donald Trump to unilaterally disarm against Putin.”\n\nAs jarring as this is on its face, the developments appear even worse when seen in context.\n\nHegseth’s order roughly coincided with Donald Trump’s Oval Office debacle with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the American president echoing Kremlin talking points, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump White House curtailing U.S. aid to Ukraine, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration terminating an initiative to protect Ukraine’s energy grid, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the president saying he’s prepared to reward Russia by welcoming it back into the G7, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration disbanding the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration paring back enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration targeting U.S. intelligence officials as part of its mass firing campaign, which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nAnd the Trump administration slashing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which was in line with Russia’s wishes.\n\nA cynic might wonder if the White House were simply taking directions from the Kremlin directly.\n\nAfter the story about Hegseth’s order reached the public, the president turned to his social media platform to declare that Americans “should spend less time worrying about Putin.” What a coincidence: That’s exactly what Moscow wants him to say.",

Mexican critics panned the film’s portrayal of cartel violence, while trans critics hated how gender transition was used as an empty plot device with a highly inaccurate depiction of the medical process of transitioning. And yet the musical has been nominated for an incredible 13 Oscars, the most of any film this awards season. With an audience score of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes, it’s clear almost everyone hates this movie, it seems, except for Oscar voters.\n\nWith an audience score of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes, it’s clear almost everyone hates this movie, it seems, except for Oscar voters.\n\nWhile all of this film discourse has taken place, the Trump administration is in the midst of broadly sweeping away the legal existence of trans people across the U.S. This is not the first time Oscars voters have propped up a trans-related film in the middle of a national political movement against trans rights. In the lead-up to the 2016 Oscars, the state of North Carolina banned trans people from bathrooms in one of the first attacks on trans rights to reach nationwide awareness. The state was hit with mass protests and boycotts for its intolerance. At the same time, actor Eddie Redmayne was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Danish trans woman Lili Elbe, one of the first transgender women to get gender-affirming surgery in the 1930s.\n\nRedmayne’s casting and subsequent Oscar buzz was widely decried by trans people, who argued that the role of one of history’s most significant trans women should have been played by a trans actress.\n\nAt the time, it was common practice to cast a cis male to play a trans woman in any mainstream Hollywood film, a decision that can incorrectly give moviegoers the idea that trans women are really men playing pretend as women. Just a year before, Jared Leto had won an Oscar for best supporting actor for playing a fictional trans woman in “Dallas Buyers Club.” A Redmayne win in 2016 would have given audiences the same idea. I can still remember the relief on trans Twitter that Oscar night when Redmayne didn’t win.\n\nIn the casting respect, at least, \"Emilia Pérez\" gets it right, having cast trans actress Karla Sofía Gascón in the lead role as a trans woman. She is up for best actress in this year’s Oscars, but her chances of winning are complicated by a series of offensive tweets about Muslims and George Floyd that surfaced from years ago.\n\nAs a trans person who also happens to run a podcast about cancel culture, I find it interesting that Gascón has been so quickly marginalized on the basis of old tweets, when other celebrities haven’t necessarily faced the same consequences for similar or even more egregious actions.\n\nMake no mistake, the tweets are racist and Islamophobic, and should be condemned. But she would hardly be the first celebrity with bigoted opinions. I mean, Mel Gibson seems to be embarking on a comeback after his infamous antisemitic rants. They’re still making “Harry Potter” movies for J.K. Rowling. Dave Chappelle still has a robust comedy career.\n\nThe frustrating reality is that trans women are often the first to get thrown under the bus when it comes to controversies like these. Social media is littered with the former accounts of trans women who dared draw negative attention to themselves before being run off the internet.\n\nThe frustrating reality is that trans women are often the first to get thrown under the bus when it comes to controversies like these.\n\nWhile Gascón said she still plans on attending the award ceremony itself, she has skipped the typical pre-Oscars pomp and parties that usuallt come with being a nominee. It feels to me as if she has been thrown out of the club to allow the absolutely horrid film she starred in to stay in the general Oscar hunt for other awards.\n\nGascón may be seemingly out of the running for an Oscar even though she’s nominated, but her cisgender co-stars and the film itself are still up for multiple awards despite near universal distaste for the movie.\n\nThere’s precedent for all of this. In 2019, the Oscars gave best picture to “Green Book,” despite widespread criticism from Black film critics and audiences, and amid reports of derogatory tweets and racist language from co-writer Nick Vallelonga and co-star Viggo Mortensen.\n\nIn the end, I wish films wouldn’t get rewarded by the academy for telling awful trans stories, or for portraying trans women as men playing pretend. It bothers me that “Emilia Pérez” is getting so many flowers this year while films like “I Saw the TV Glow,” an incredibly produced and nuanced horror film from A24 that tells an allegory about being in the closet as a trans person, has gone widely ignored (even, shockingly, by the GLAAD Awards). “I Saw the TV Glow” connected viscerally with nearly every trans person I know who saw it, and it was directed by nonbinary director Jane Schoenbrun.\n\n“Emilia Pérez,” on the other hand, perpetuates a lazy trope about the trans experience that feels especially harmful in the present political climate.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump is selling America, literally.\n\nThe administration's latest immigration proposal is something that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called the \"Trump gold card\" — a visa for wealthy foreigners willing to spend $5 million for a pathway to U.S. citizenship.\n\nWhen Trump delivers his first address to Congress on Tuesday night, he will likely frame this idea as a matter of economic pragmatism, although research shows these “golden visa” programs typically contribute no more than 0.3% of the gross domestic product and have a negligible impact on growth.\n\nBut it's more insidious than that. This new proposal is in keeping with Trump's idea of America as one of exclusion, not inclusion.\n\nAt the same time that he wants to sell citizenship to the highest bidders, Trump is seeking to remove people who are already here. In his first term, he separated families of migrants who had crossed the border illegally and sought to ban travelers from six Muslim majority countries. In his second term, he's outsourced deportations, used Guantánamo Bay as a migrant detention site and sought to make it easier for immigration agents to enter places of worship.\n\nIt's a wholesale rewrite of what it means to be an American.\n\nThe \"gold card\" proposal is the flip side of this dark record. More than just a policy, it's a wholesale rewrite of what it means to be an American. In Trump’s vision, citizenship is no longer about building a shared national project; it is an asset reserved for those who can afford it, as it is in countries with \"golden visa\" programs such as Malta and Cyprus. Being American would become a high-end commodity, available only to the wealthy.\n\nThe proposal exploits the growing disillusionment of working-class Americans in urban and suburban communities who feel the ground crumbling beneath them. They’ve spent their lives working hard, only to see their jobs shipped overseas and their communities hollowed out. As prices rise and making ends meet becomes harder, opportunity feels like a winner-takes-all scenario. When local programs lose funding, factories shut down and jobs disappear. When communities feel the surge of illegal immigration and see government resources misallocated, resentment festers. And when families who have lived in these neighborhoods for generations struggle while new arrivals seek a better life, frustration turns to division.\n\nBut immigrants don’t weaken America, they strengthen it. Families who come here to work, build and contribute are the very people who keep the country’s promise alive.\n\nDemocrats, meantime, are failing to meet the moment. It is not enough to call Trump’s immigration policies inhumane. They are that but they are also something more dangerous: a seductive narrative about who deserves to be here and why. And as Trump spins this narrative, Democrats remain unable to articulate a compelling vision of what American citizenship should mean.\n\nDemocrats had the chance in 2024, and they blew it. Instead of making a forceful argument for immigration as a system of order, security and national strength, they hedged and waffled. Instead of calling Trump’s bluff — pointing out that his party has no real plan beyond exclusion — they let the debate be defined on his terms because of border influx that the Biden administration failed to address and on out-of-touch ideas that presidential candidates floated in 2020.\n\nAmerica has never been just a marketplace. It has always been a national project of people and heritage — something greater than GDP, something defined not just by who gets in, but also by what those people contribute and how they become part of a shared culture and set of values. That is the difference between citizenship and consumerism, between a nation and a business deal. And it is that idea that Democrats must champion.\n\nThe American dream isn’t just an abstraction, it’s what has driven generations to work night shifts, to build something better, to believe in endless possibility.\n\nThe American dream isn’t just an abstraction, it’s what has driven generations to work night shifts, to build something better, to believe in endless possibility. And that dream can only survive if America remains a place that rewards effort, not just privilege. That is the vision Democrats need to fight for, not a country where citizenship is auctioned off to the highest bidder, but one where longtime residents and immigrants alike are given a fair shot.\n\nA serious Democratic vision for immigration cannot just respond to Trump’s daily theatrics. It must be a common-sense approach that upholds both security and strength, stops the flow of illegal immigration, fights crime and recognizes immigration as a cornerstone of the American project — not a problem to be managed, not a privilege for the rich, but an opportunity to strengthen the nation. If Democrats fail to make that case, they will once again find themselves on defense against a movement that has already decided what America should be.\n\nTrump's address should be a warning. His immigration agenda is not just a policy, but it's also a vision for America’s future. If Democrats do not counter it with one of their own, they will have lost the fight before it even began.\n\nSubscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates on and expert insight into the key issues and figures defining his second term.",

        "content": "As Friday’s fiasco in the Oval Office made painfully clear to the nation and the world, Donald Trump and his White House have a problem with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Indeed, over the last few days, there’s been all kinds of talk emanating from the West Wing about the Ukrainian leader needing to “apologize” to the American president — and perhaps even resigning.\n\nBut what is it, specifically, that Zelenskyy did that was wrong?\n\nZelenskyy apparently made the wrong fashion choices: Before the Ukrainian leader even entered the White House, he was greeted by Trump, who said: “Look, you’re all dressed up today.” Interest in Zelenskyy’s clothing intensified from there, especially among conservative media personalities — though they appeared far less concerned about Elon Musk wearing a baseball cap and a “tech support” T-shirt in the West Wing.\n\nZelenskyy apparently used “body language” the White House didn’t like: During an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said the Ukrainian president was “incredibly disrespectful” while being berated in the Oval Office. To bolster the point, he pointed to “the body language, the shaking of head ... the arms crossed.”\n\nZelenskyy apparently had criticisms for the authoritarian leader who invaded his country and butchered his people: After the Ukrainian leader said Russia’s Vladimir Putin “hates” Ukraine, Trump chided Zelensky for “speaking badly about somebody else” — because if there’s one thing we know about the Republican president, it’s that he just cannot abide speaking badly about people.\n\nZelenskyy apparently “litigated”: Waltz and JD Vance have complained more than once in recent days that the Ukrainian president “litigated” in public, which apparently means he told the truth about the war in his country. Those are facts U.S. officials recognized and agreed with up until six weeks ago, and it’s not at all clear why Zelenskyy was supposed to keep the truth to himself during his White House visit.\n\nZelenskyy apparently “Ukraine-splained”: Two days after the fiasco in the Oval Office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio complained that the Ukrainian leader “found every opportunity to try to ‘Ukraine-splain’ on every issue.” Of course, had the American president and vice president not made so many factual errors, and had been less eager to echo the Kremlin’s talking points, it’s likely that Zelenskyy wouldn’t have felt the need to explain the basics to his hosts in ways that hurt their feelings.\n\nEach of these complaints make Trump and his team appear rather weak and easily offended — unless, of course, the White House planned to take offense from the outset, and Republican officials looked for post-hoc rationalizations to justify the positions they were going to take anyway.",

        "title": "Elon Musk slams Social Security as a ‘Ponzi scheme,’ sparking new concerns",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s recent social media posts leave little doubt: He has been thinking about Social Security a lot lately. In fact, Donald Trump’s biggest campaign donor and the head of the quasi-governmental DOGE operation keeps tweeting bizarre claims about alleged fraud and “inconsistencies” he thinks he has identified in the Social Security system.\n\nThose claims have invariably collapsed under scrutiny. Indeed, it has become rather embarrassing lately. Musk claimed, for example, that millions of people over the age of 130 were receiving Social Security checks — he said it was perhaps “the biggest fraud in the history of humanity” — but none of this was true.\n\nIt’s possible that the billionaire GOP megadonor just doesn’t know enough about government programs to understand how wrong he is. It’s also possible that Musk is indifferent to the facts and is engaged in a misinformation campaign. Either way, there’s no reason for the public to take his claims at face value, since they keep getting debunked.\n\nIt’s against this backdrop that many of the nation’s most powerful Republicans, including Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, continue to peddle Musk’s claims about Social Security as if they were true. They are not.\n\nBut the problem is not limited to Musk’s falsehoods. After all, the fact that he’s plainly wrong might not be consequential at all: Musk claims to have found “fraud”; reality proves otherwise; and we all move on with our lives. Right?\n\nWell, maybe not. Making matters worse is the apparent fact that the donor helping run the executive branch in 2025 has a problem with the Social Security system itself. USA Today reported:\n\nElon Musk sharply criticized Social Security in a Friday podcast interview with Joe Rogan, labeling the critical elder benefits program a “Ponzi scheme.” Musk, who is the world’s richest man and an increasingly powerful adviser to President Donald Trump, also described the federal government as “one big pyramid scheme.” Musk is a leading figure in the administration’s effort — largely through the Department of Government Efficiency — to cut costs and dismantle the federal bureaucracy.\n\nAnd it’s at this point where the offensive becomes tougher to shrug off.\n\nIndeed, let’s take stock. Trump has put his top campaign donor in a position of enormous authority, despite Musk’s unfamiliarity with basics of governing. This same donor regularly peddles falsehoods about Social Security, keeps suggesting there are people receiving benefits checks that shouldn’t exist, is helping advance thousands of layoffs at the Social Security administration and, in case that weren’t quite enough, is condemning the structure of the popular social insurance program.\n\nIt’d be tough to blame someone who relies on Social Security for feeling a bit nervous right about now.\n\n“You don’t need to scratch your head and wonder what’s going on when you see that the Trump administration is decimating Social Security offices and staff,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “And you don’t need to ponder what might happen next when Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, says that the tens-of-millions of seniors, families, and children who depend on these earned benefits are part of some scam — because that’s a real threat and a real promise: they are coming for your Social Security.”\n\nThe New York Democrat added, “The richest man in the world and his sidekick, the President of the United States, have decided to attack the bedrock of America’s social safety net, and now your pocket is in the way.”\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "title": "How the right's anti-Ukraine shift happened",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "With President Donald Trump and officials in his administration channeling Kremlin-created narratives on the war in Ukraine, cozying up to Vladimir Putin and opposing a United Nations resolution naming Russia as the aggressor, one may legitimately ask if Trump’s America is now allied with Putin’s Russia. And another long-simmering question comes back with a new urgency: What is it with the American right and Putin?\n\nTo some extent, the right wing’s Putin lovefest is simply the result of cultlike fealty to Trump: If he blasted the Putin regime as an evil empire tomorrow, most conservative pundits and “influencers” would follow. But Trump’s evident affection for the Moscow dictator — which doesn’t require conspiratorial explanations like KGB recruitment or blackmail — also lines up with some independently existing trends on the right.\n\nTo some extent, the right wing’s Putin lovefest is simply the result of cultlike fealty to Trump.\n\nIn an astute analysis, expatriate Russian political strategist Stanislav Belkovsky argued that Trump’s affinity for Putin is explained by several factors: his hatred for the American and European political “establishment” and readiness to see its enemies (including Putin) as allies; his general affection for authoritarian rulers; and grudges over what he sees as his persecution by Democrats over charges of pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine misconduct.\n\nBut it’s not just Trump: Plenty of others on the right share some of these attitudes.\n\nAnti-establishment animus, for instance, has long flourished among conservatives — and, almost by definition, among libertarians.\n\nFor some, the hostility is directed at America’s “interventionist” global leadership and often accompanied by sympathy for America’s foes abroad. One prominent exponent of such views is former Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who, in addition to his GOP presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, actually was the Libertarian Party’s nominee in 1988. Paul was described as “Putin’s new best friend” by Lucia Graves in National Journal at the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2014 for his knee-jerk defenses of Putin and attacks on what Paul referred to as “Western politicians and media.” While his son Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a much tougher stance toward Moscow at the time, he has more recently moved into the more pro-Russia camp, even praising what he called Trump’s “message to the Ukrainian warmongers.”\n\nOthers see the modern secular West as a den of anti-Christian decadence and readily fall for Putin’s posturing as a champion of traditional and religious values. Back in 2013, right-wing populist Pat Buchanan — whose xenophobic revolt against the GOP establishment in the 1990s foreshadowed Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement — hailed Putin as “one of us” in the culture war against the “new immorality.” For others, the issue is “globalism” or “cancel culture” or distrust of the “mainstream media” — while Putin’s Russia is seen as a stronghold of national sovereignty, an “anti-woke” haven, or a source of alternative narratives.\n\nAnd for some figures on the right such as Tucker Carlson — who is a leader, not a follower, in the Trumpian right’s pro-Russia drift — all these preoccupations are rolled into one big ball of anti-Western, pro-Russian contrarianism.\n\nNeedless to say, Putin’s right-wing fans are untroubled by the contradictions between their ideals and the reality of the Putin regime — a reality in which the “cancellation” of dissenters is often quite literal (see Alexei Navalny or Boris Nemtsov), assaults on Christianity take the form of horrific persecution against Ukrainian evangelical Christians and other Protestants in Russian-occupied territories, and Ukraine’s national sovereignty is trampled in a brutal war of aggression. The regime’s actual values don’t matter as long as they can be a battering ram against “the establishment.”\n\nThe role of authoritarianism in the right’s Putin sympathies shouldn’t be discounted either. “National Conservatism,” an intellectual movement launched during Trump’s first term to give Trumpian populism a respectable foundation, is openly contemptuous of liberalism — not only in its left-of-center American political sense, but in a more classical sense that includes the pro-liberty, pro-individual rights conservatism of Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe role of authoritarianism in the right’s Putin sympathies shouldn’t be discounted.\n\nOne author associated with the movement, Christopher Caldwell, offered a gushy valentine to Putin as a “hero to populist conservatives around the world” in a 2017 speech at conservative-leaning Hillsdale College. While acknowledging Putin’s repression of dissent and likely connection to political murders, Caldwell wrote that Putin was an outstanding leader by “traditional measures” such as “the defense of borders and national flourishing.” While these claims look particularly ironic today after the damage Putin’s war has inflicted on Russia, the overt declaration that leaders should be measured by standards that pointedly exclude liberty and respect for human rights is especially startling.\n\nMeanwhile, far-right blogger Curtis Yarvin, a self-proclaimed monarchist who openly advocates for the replacement of liberal democracy with autocracy, has fantasized that the Putin regime will not only conquer Ukraine but reprise Tsarist Russia’s (brief) 19th-century role as the crusher of liberalism in Europe. This crankery would be negligible if Vice President JD Vance hadn’t expressed admiration for Yarvin’s work.\n\nStill, outright Putin love is fairly rare in GOP ranks; the fawning is limited mostly to a small cadre of pundits, too-online influencers and trolls. A recent Economist/YouGov poll found that only 18% of Republicans had a favorable opinion of the Russian dictator. But that’s still too high (the comparable numbers for Democrats and independents are 8% and 9%, respectively), and it’s likely this 18% comes from the hardcore, activist part of the “base.” In the same poll, Republicans were the only group in which negative opinions of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dominated: 40% unfavorable to 38% favorable.\n\nThose are dangerous trends. The MAGA-fied GOP may not be in the Putin camp, but it is already leaning toward the anti-Ukraine camp. And this drift is based on misguided devotion to Trump and even more misguided ideas about Russia and the West.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The NBC affiliate in Denver ran a strange story last week about a group of Republicans in Colorado who came up with an unusual request for the Trump administration. According to the local report, these GOP officials envision a scheme in which the White House agrees to block funding for the Rocky Mountain State until Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, agrees to pardon a convicted criminal named Tina Peters.\n\nIt was, to be sure, a bizarre pitch, which will not and cannot happen, but it was a timely reminder that for some on the far-right, Peters’ case remains highly relevant. In fact, The New York Times reported that even Donald Trump’s Justice Department has apparently taken an interest in the matter.\n\nThe Justice Department said on Monday that it would review the conviction of the former clerk of Mesa County, Colo., who was found guilty of state charges last summer of tampering with voting machines under her control in a failed attempt to prove that they had been used to rig the 2020 election against President Trump. The decision was the latest example of the Justice Department under Mr. Trump’s control seeking to use its powers to support those who have acted on his behalf and to go after those who have criticized or opposed him.\n\nWhile the Times’ report hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the developments are not the subject of rumor or scuttlebutt: The article specifically noted that the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil division unexpectedly filed a court this week, declaring that “reasonable concerns have been raised about various aspects of Ms. Peters’s case.”\n\nAt this point, some readers might be thinking, “Her name sounds familiar, but I’m not quite sure who Tina Peters is.” With this in mind, let’s take a stroll down memory lane.\n\nPeters was a county clerk in Colorado who eagerly embraced Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories about his 2020 election defeat, but that’s not all she did. Peters also acted on those lies and conspiracy theories, using someone’s security badge to allow a Mike Lindell associate to access county election equipment.\n\nThe apparent point of the endeavor was to leak election machinery data in pursuit of a conspiratorial plot that never existed in reality.\n\nNot surprisingly, Peters was caught and indicted. She pleaded not guilty, but after she and her attorney struggled to present a compelling defense, a Colorado jury convicted Peters, finding her guilty of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.\n\nAhead of sentencing, Peters showed no remorse. A judge ultimately sentenced her to nine years behind bars.\n\nThis was a state official, charged with state crimes, by state prosecutors, in a state court, with a state jury, overseen by a state judge. What did the case have to do with federal law enforcement? Literally nothing.\n\nAnd yet, six weeks into the Trump administration, the Republican-led Justice Department is nevertheless taking an interest in the case\n\nThe scrutiny of Peters case, according to Yaakov Roth, the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil division, was an extension of the president’s executive order related to ending the “weaponization of the federal government.”\n\nBut this turns reality on its head. The Justice Department’s unwarranted intervention in this case serves as a timely reminder that, in 2025, federal law enforcement is focused on the interests of Trump’s friends and allies.\n\nThe brazenness is so plainly ridiculous, the Republican administration is hardly even trying to keep up appearances, and there’s every reason to believe this will get worse in the coming days, weeks, months and years.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In no time at all, speaking a language other than English in public is going to feel like an act of political defiance. On Friday morning, The Wall Street Journal first reported that the president would sign an executive order to make English the official language of the United States. The White House later confirmed the move, and as NBC News notes, “it’s the first time in history the country would have an official language.”\n\nAt first glance, Donald Trump’s move might seem like common sense.\n\nAt first glance, Donald Trump’s move might seem like common sense. The vast majority of Americans speak English: According to the most recent census data, 78.3% of the country speaks only English at home. That the U.S. is an English-dominant country cannot be disputed. But the order would bring with it more insidious consequences that demonstrate Trump and his allies mean to enforce a restrictive definition of what it means to be American.\n\nBecause this executive order isn’t just about acknowledging the dominance of English. It would also rescind the federal mandate that requires federal agencies and other recipients of federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. This mandate, originally issued by President Bill Clinton, ensured that millions of Americans could access government services, regardless of their primary language. CBS News reports that agencies will still be able to provide documents and services in other languages, but this order strips away the requirement to do so. In effect, it gives permission to shut out non-English speakers from services their tax dollars pay for.\n\nStripping this access will make life significantly harder for millions — according to 2019 census data, approximately 8% of the country speaks English less than “very well” — leaving them without guaranteed access to critical information and support. Without required language access, navigating essential services will become more difficult.\n\nStill more troubling, Trump’s proposed executive order is not merely about language policy. It is also the latest move in a long American tradition of leveraging English proficiency to judge who “belongs” and who does not.\n\nThroughout our history, the effort to define this country as monolingually English has coincided with efforts to exclude certain groups from full participation in society. Indigenous children were forced into boarding schools where they were punished for speaking their own languages. Spanish was banned from classrooms in the Southwest to force assimilation. During World War I, laws were passed to ban German in schools. The push for English-only policies has never been about communication; it has always been about control, about who gets to be seen as fully American and who does not.\n\nThat sentiment was evident on Friday when ProEnglish — which bills itself as “the nation’s leading advocate of official English” but has ties to the modern anti-immigrant movement — quickly praised Trump’s plan.\n\n“The president properly responded to the disconnect that undermined America’s traditional process of immigrant assimilation. Every American should be proud of their national origin, race, native language, and customs. But without public policies that reinforce the English tie that unites us, multilingual diversity could well become the undoing of our country,” said acting ProEnglish Executive Director Stephanie White.\n\nRhetoric that frames non-English speakers (or even bilingual and trilingual Americans) as unpatriotic infiltrators might appeal to xenophobic Americans, but it has no basis in reality. Immigrants and their children overwhelmingly learn English. One Cato Institute report from 2019 estimates that “about 91 percent of immigrants in the United States between 1980 and 2010 reportedly spoke English compared with 86 percent who lived here from 1900 to 1930. While immigrants with different backgrounds are more or less likely to learn English than others, our analysis unambiguously shows that today’s immigrants are more likely to learn English than immigrants in the beginning of the last century.”\n\nRhetoric that frames non-English speakers (or even bilingual and trilingual Americans) as unpatriotic infiltrators has no basis in reality.\n\nYet English-only advocates continue to promote the false idea that linguistic diversity threatens national identity. They ignore the fact that the U.S. has always been multilingual; that by the 16th century, Spanish was spoken in much of the Southwest, years before English arrived; and that Indigenous languages existed here for centuries before colonization.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. is the fourth-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world, according to the Cervantes Institute, and home to more than 350 languages, according to the Census Bureau. The suggestion that the only authentic way to be American is to speak English, exclusively, ignores both history and modern reality: that America has always been polyglot.\n\n“America has never had an official language — because we don’t need one,” the Congressional Hispanic Caucus posted Friday afternoon on X. “Trump’s plan to make English official is a direct attack on our diversity and history. Millions of Americans speak other languages, and that doesn’t make them any less American.”\n\nTrump’s executive order would do nothing to improve government efficiency or to help Americans. It does not even have material benefits to those who speak only English. Rather, it strips away language access protections and sends a clear message: If you don’t speak English, you don’t belong. The move is yet more extremist, political bullying that divides us further.\n\nTrump can make English the official language, but language has always been fluid and evolving, shaped by the people who speak it. And in classrooms, communities and political spaces, non-English speakers have long been active participants in shaping this country. This proposed executive order cannot change that.",

        "content": "This post is part of the digital companion series to Jen Psaki’s “The Blueprint,” a new podcast examining where Democrats stand after big losses in 2024 and how they can win again. Below is an adapted excerpt edited for length and clarity from the March 3 episode featuring former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams.\n\nWithin hours of taking office, President Donald Trump followed through on one of his top campaign promises, attacking diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal workforce. But what Trump and other Republicans have failed to realize is that DEI isn’t new and it isn’t tangential. Although the acronym gained attention in the past 5 to 10 years, the core principles it represents have been around since America’s inception.\n\nWe’ve allowed the intention of DEI to be hijacked by those who want the freedom to discriminate.\n\nWe know that from the very beginning of this country, despite our national credo, the government purportedly by and for the people immediately raised barriers to block full participation in the American Dream. To dismantle these impediments, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments were necessary first steps toward including Black Americans. Native Americans received citizenship in 1924 and the Chicano Movement began to remedy the oppression of Mexican-Americans. We had the 19th Amendment and Title IX to help women get on equal footing. We have the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title I for poor kids, and the Family and Medical Leave Act. Despite their timing and target, these are all massive DEI laws. Laws passed by Democrats and Republicans, all intended to make sure that diversity, equity and inclusion are part of our nation’s story.\n\nSimply put, diversity means all people. That’s all it is. Diversity means all people should have the chance to participate. Equity means that everyone has a fair opportunity. Inclusion means everyone should have a pathway to the American dream. Our entire country is premised on DEI, a foundational set of values that oppose uniformity, inequality and exclusivity. But the problem is, we’ve allowed the intention of DEI to be hijacked by those who want the freedom to discriminate.\n\nSo when you see people who are anti-DEI, what we should be asking is which part don’t they like? Is it opposition to the diversity part, because they think too many people get a fair shot in today’s America? Do they not like the idea of equity, because they don’t want to have to compete? Or are they offended by inclusion because they believe some people should be isolated and kept away from opportunity?\n\nWe, as Americans, have to correct past mistakes and provide everyone with access to the ability to improve their beginnings and imagine more. As legal scholar Kenji Yoshino said to me recently, “Talent is everywhere. Opportunity is not.” DEI is about how we marry the two.\n\nToo often, race, gender, disability, class, sexual identity and other differences are dismissed as cultural issues. And it’s not just the Republican Party treating immutable characteristics as choices to be made. In the aftermath of Kamala Harris’ loss, some members of the Democratic Party argued that paying too much attention to the attacks on these communities drove voters away. But I push back on that idea and against the relegation of my humanity as merely a cultural issue, like the kind of music I like or the TV shows I prefer.\n\nPart of Trump’s tactical toolbox is chaos and cacophony. He makes so much noise that you forget to look at what he’s actually doing.\n\nI am a woman, so abortion rights are not a cultural issue. It’s a medical issue. It’s an economic issue. It’s an educational issue. It’s a moral issue. As a Black person, my race isn’t a cultural fascination. In this country, race has long been the excuse for barriers to a person’s ability to take care of themselves and their families. When identity becomes weaponized as an excuse for blocking access, we are not the America we aspire to be.\n\nCreating divides by pretending differences are distractions is just one small part of what Trump and the Republican Party seek to accomplish with their flurry of executive orders. The administration has flooded the zone with a barrage of policy changes to distract the American people from what it means to cancel a contract with a service-disabled veteran or make a lactation room a violation of federal policy.\n\nSo if Americans want to fight back, we must pay attention. We must differentiate between what is shock and awe and what is meaningful action. Part of Trump’s tactical toolbox is chaos and cacophony. He makes so much noise that you forget to look at what he’s actually doing — that’s why I call him a flimflam artist. The pain and harm he causes is real and we should never diminish that, but we also can’t give him more credit than he’s due.\n\nFor example, despite what Trump says about birthright citizenship, the president cannot rescind a constitutional amendment with an executive order. Something like that can’t happen unless we allow it to happen. And simply because your particular identity isn’t under attack, do not be fooled. You might be next. Right now, we have systems in place to stop our nation from restoring its original sins, but Trump has weakened our faith in our systems and each other.\n\nAmerica doesn’t simply exist by wishing and hoping, our systems of laws and customs exist by intention. My advice for Democrats is not to just talk about resistance, but also demonstrate insistence. We have to insist on recognizing our common humanity, our bounty of differences, our system of government and our work that has yet to be done. And we have to insist on our politicians doing their jobs to protect us all.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A combat veteran fired from his job at the IRS. Another vet fired from a job at the Veterans Administration. An architect who was restoring George Washington’s office at Valley Forge, also fired. The mother of a child with cystic fibrosis who has benefited from medical research conducted at the National Institutes of Health. A patient terrified that Congress will cut the Medicaid that allows her to get treatment for her breast cancer.\n\nThese are some of the guests Democratic members of Congress are taking to President Donald Trump’s address Tuesday night, people whose experiences tell a very different story from the one Trump wants to tell. For a change, Democrats are sending exactly the right message to the public, even if their megaphone isn’t as large as Trump’s: When you eviscerate the federal government, real people get hurt.\n\nTrump’s speech will undoubtedly paint a picture of a transformed America, returned at last to its lost greatness. While this isn’t technically a State of the Union address, it should encourage Democrats to remind voters of reality.\n\nThey need to point Americans to the objective facts and encourage them to take a good, hard look at what the actual state of our union is, especially as it has changed in the six weeks since Trump took office.\n\nThe mass firings of federal workers ordered by the Trump administration’s Elon Musk-led (but not officially) “Department of Government Efficiency” have begun what will most likely be the largest single round of government layoffs in American history, creating the risk of touching off a recession as the impact of job losses spreads through communities around the country. Trump is also about to impose 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and increase tariffs on Chinese goods, which is almost certain to fuel more price increases. That may be part of the reason consumer confidence is dropping. And we all know how expensive eggs have gotten.\n\nThat’s just the beginning.\n\nDemocrats also have an opportunity to be the party that stands in opposition to cutbacks that will make us all more vulnerable to corruption and abuse.\n\nDemocrats must take the opportunity to shine light on how Musk’s rampage through federal agencies will most likely result in a degradation of both taxpayer-facing services and key government functions. The administration will be firing thousands of workers at the Social Security Administration and plans to close many of the offices that provide customer service to beneficiaries (Musk recently called the incredibly popular program a “Ponzi scheme,” an extraordinary gift to Democrats). As Americans start preparing their tax returns, thousands of workers at the IRS are also on the chopping block, most likely producing worse customer service and slower processing of returns.\n\nIn the heart of flu season and amid a deadly new measles outbreak, the Food and Drug Administration canceled its annual meeting to determine next year’s flu vaccine, potentially damaging our response to the next round of infections. Warnings are coming in that the mass layoffs will threaten our ability to fight wildfires, prevent new epidemics and deliver basic services that millions of Americans rely on.\n\nDemocrats also have an opportunity to be the party that stands in opposition to cutbacks that will make us all more vulnerable to corruption and abuse.\n\nThe administration has dropped multiple cases against financial firms being investigated for misleading consumers and engaging in various kinds of misbehavior as part of its gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, giving a green light to scammers everywhere to prey on people. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is preparing to cut off most of the funding for the enforcement of fair housing laws. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department has stopped enforcement of a rule meant to make it more difficult to launder money and set up phony shell companies, and it has all but shut down oversight of the crypto industry. What could go wrong?\n\nThen, Democrats should make the case to America that there’s foreseeable long-term damage — which will become visible only over time.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, the engine of America’s world-leading medical research, has stopped issuing new grants and is in a general state of chaos. Internship programs in a wide variety of agencies that recruit talented young people to government service have been canceled. The administration is doing everything in its power to crush the development of renewable energy and increase carbon emissions, potentially worsening the effects of climate change. And Trump plans to cut the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 65%, the probable result of which will be dirtier air and water.\n\nIf that weren’t enough, the government could shut down in less than two weeks.\n\nAs horrifying as all that may be, there’s another, more hopeful story taking shape — and Democrats should be making Americans aware of it, as well.\n\nDemocrats should make the case to America that there’s foreseeable long-term damage — which will become visible only over time.\n\nPeople are rising up to oppose what Trump and Musk are doing: Fired federal workers are organizing to educate the public about how the government serves them and what is being lost, demonstrators are assembling in national parks around the country to protest cuts to the National Park Service, constituents are flocking to town halls to express their anger at Republican representatives who support the brutal cuts to federal staff and services that the administration is carrying out.\n\nThere is a grassroots movement forming, and only some of it is coming from liberal activists; it also includes people who may have voted for Trump because they were mad about inflation and never thought he’d cut off disease research or fire their neighbors. Democrats should get behind that movement — and know that if they don’t, they could face their own backlash from voters who want them to meet the moment.\n\nIt would be a mistake to think the damage from this effort to decimate the government won’t be awful. But perhaps when it’s over, more Americans will appreciate the value the federal workforce brings to all our lives. They may even learn that the military veterans who enjoy nearly universal esteem make up around 30% of federal workers, despite representing only 6% of the adult population (the federal government gives preference to veterans in hiring, a form of affirmative action even Republicans support).\n\nDemocrats have been slow to respond to the carnage happening around them, stunned by the sheer audacity of Trump’s assault and unsure about what their message should be. But as they look around, they should see that people are not happy about the state of the union. Showing the public exactly who is being hurt by the destruction of government, which Trump’s address has given them the chance to do, is a good place to start.",

He proposed everything from a \"golden visa\" for the wealthy to a cryptocurrency reserve, but for now they remain just proposals.\n\nHere’s a mostly complete look at what the Trump administration has done over the last seven days:\n\n• Passed a House budget on party lines that could cut Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\n• Imposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada that went into effect on Tuesday.\n\n• Scrambled to rehire staffers with the Food & Drug Administration who monitor the safety of medical devices.\n\n• Proposed a \"gold card\" visa that would allow people to become lawful permanent residents for $5 million.\n\n• Criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face in a shockingly contentious White House meeting.\n\n• Slashed staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, fulfilling a Project 2025 goal.\n\n• Announced the White House would take control of a press pool run by journalists for more than a century.\n\n• Announced that it would strip security clearances from a white-shoe law firm for working with former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\n• Announced that the Treasury Department will no longer enforce an anti-money laundering law.\n\n• Began planning a nationwide operation to potentially deport children who came into the U.S. without a parent or guardian.\n\n• Proposed that the U.S. government purchase and hold cryptocurrencies in a \"Crypto Strategic Reserve.\"\n\n• Said, through the Health and Human Services secretary, that measles deaths are \"not unusual,\" though the U.S. hasn't had one since 2015.\n\n• Wrote an unusual op-ed for Fox News in which the HHS secretary said the measles vaccine should be \"readily accessible for all those who want them.\"\n\n• Reportedly moved to cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to overhaul air traffic control systems and give it to Musk’s Starlink.\n\n• Made plans for large-scale layoffs at federal agencies in March and April in a memo calling the federal workforce \"bloated\" and \"corrupt.\"\n\n• Floated a plan to put tariffs on copper as part of a move to hurt China's growth in the sector.\n\n• Threatened to put 25% tariffs on the European Union, claiming, inaccurately, that the economic bloc was formed \"to screw\" the U.S.\n\n• Filed three bills to impeach judges who ruled against the Trump administration in recent weeks.\n\n• Invited billionaire federal contractor Elon Musk to Trump’s first Cabinet meeting, although he is not a member of the Cabinet.\n\n• Said at that Cabinet meeting that the country has \"gotten bloated and fat and disgusting.\"\n\n• Denied access to The Associated Press, Reuters, HuffPost and a German newspaper at the Cabinet meeting.\n\n• Revealed, after refusing to answer for weeks, that federal worker Amy Gleason is nominally the head of the DOGE effort.\n\n• Floated removing government spending from gross domestic product (GDP) reports, complicating any analysis of DOGE cuts.\n\n• Floated a controversial budget maneuver that would let Congress say that Trump's tax cut bill cost nothing, instead of trillions.\n\n• Posted a video on Truth Social that showed the Gaza Strip as a resort featuring gold statues of Trump.\n\n• Threatened to sue journalists who use anonymous sources or off-the-record quotes in news articles and books.\n\n• Blamed, without evidence, \"paid 'troublemakers'\" for Republican lawmakers facing tough questions at town hall meetings.\n\nSubscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates on and expert insight into the key issues and figures defining his second term.",

        "content": "Mega-billionaire Elon Musk has posted a “wall of receipts” online that he claims shows how much money he has saved taxpayers with his cost-slashing “Department of Government Efficiency” operation. But it turns out that ledger is riddled with massive amounts of misinformation and inaccuracies that dramatically exaggerate — or, to put it less charitably, deceive — the public about how much money Musk’s “efficiency” initiative is saving.\n\nMusk said on his wall of receipts that DOGE saved $8 billion from a single canceled contract at the Department of Homeland Security. It turned out that contract was for just $8 million. A listed $1.9 billion cut at the Treasury Department actually took place under President Joe Biden. An Associated Press analysis found that 40% of contracts cut by DOGE aren’t expected to save the government any money, according to the administration’s own data.\n\nMusk is being efficient, if one takes the view that he is more interested in destroying things than building things in the government.\n\nMusk is also quietly scrapping some of the false information that he posts, but without any kind of acknowledgment of inaccuracy. The New York Times points out that the original top five items listed on the “wall of receipts” have been deleted after scrutiny from reporters revealed they were incorrect. Among other things, those items included three $655 million cuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development that was actually a single cut that was counted three times, and a $232 million cut at the Social Security Administration that turned out to actually be a much smaller $560,000 project. While these items have been removed from the list, the total listed savings have only grown — but without any clear explanation of how.\n\nMusk’s wall of receipts also showcases yet another example of how farcical it is to say DOGE is about making the government run “efficiently.” As NBC News reports, the wall of receipts lists dozens of blanket purchase agreements, or BPAs, on its list of canceled spending. But BPAs aren’t actual orders; they’re “more like a catalog of things the government might buy,” as NBC News explains. Listing BPAs exaggerates canceled spending, because the money allocated for them wasn’t necessarily going to be spent.\n\nAnd, just as important, listing BPAs obscures the fact that they exist for the precise purpose of keeping costs down. They involve negotiated rates from vetted vendors for likely purchases — they’re arrangements for saving money and moving procurement more quickly. NBC News found that Musk listed at least $1 billion value in canceled contracts from BPAs. The BPA cancellations are a perverse two-for-one deal: they allow Musk to exaggerate savings and demonize the kinds of deals that would allow the government to save money.\n\nSome of this might seem somewhat counterintuitive. Every day there’s news about how DOGE is wreaking havoc on the federal workforce and its ability to administer services through cutbacks and mass firings.\n\nOn some level DOGE is having an extraordinary effect on the government. That’s all true. At the same time, it’s also true that Musk regularly peddles misinformation about what he’s doing and how much money he’s saving. In fact, even Musk’s non-credible topline claim of having saved $65 billion so far through DOGE cuts amounts to only about 0.9% of the 2024 federal budget.\n\nIn a way, Musk is being efficient, if one takes the view that he is more interested in destroying things than building things in the government. In a very short period of time with a very small team, he has done an extraordinary job of demoralizing and intimidating millions of federal workers and disabling the federal government’s ability to administer social services — particularly those seen as liberal. He's also very quickly shrouded some of the most basic elements of governance in a cloud of unreliable information, making it harder to hold him accountable.\n\nBut as far as making the government efficient or saving lots of money for taxpayers, this has the makings of a scam.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "It’s been four years since President Donald Trump last addressed a joint session of Congress, and you can bet that tonight’s speech will not focus on unifying our nation through measured, bipartisan policy proposals. Instead, I anticipate an address full of dubious bluster designed to elate his base, unnerve the left and deflect attention away from one of his most glaring broken promises thus far.\n\nMy educated guess is, generally, that we will be in for a long night. (I wouldn't be surprised if he surpasses President Bill Clinton's impressively long 90-minute State of the Union in 2000.)\n\nTo begin, I expect Trump to spend at least some time relitigating his last four years out of office.\n\nTo begin, I expect Trump to spend at least some time relitigating his last four years out of office. Think of this as the, “I was wronged” portion of the evening. This is where he is likely to go off the prompter and attack former President Joe Biden, rant about the Department of Justice and insult former special counsel Jack Smith. At the end of this section, look for some sort of mention of retribution.\n\nThen, I predict, he will transition to achievements from his first six weeks in office, especially on the topic of immigration. According to early data, illegal border crossings along the U.S. border with Mexico have dropped dramatically, a legitimately big win for the Trump administration and something he will absolutely emphasize.\n\nElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is also a key part of Trump’s 100 days agenda, albeit a much murkier one. There are many questions swirling around the amount of savings actually achieved by DOGE, and its inexcusable, sloppy firings of federal employees. But Trump isn’t going to acknowledge any of that, of course. Expect him instead to tout Musk’s crusade against government waste — real or imagined — as he did at CPAC a couple of weeks ago.\n\nOn the foreign policy front, our “America First” president will be unable to avoid discussing the very public White House blowup he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week. Again, the base seems to love Trump’s chest-thumping bravado, but keep an eye out for any Republicans tempering their applause.\n\nTrump loves to threaten his perceived rivals, and the Ukrainian debacle has given him a whole new reason to go after the European Union and our allies abroad. Zelenskyy was welcomed with open arms by European leaders over the weekend, and there is very little doubt that Trump will take this as a snub. It’s even possible Trump will announce some new form of punishment, tied to NATO or tariffs.\n\nThat’s the kind of moment that the base loves but leaders on both sides of the party dread, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nTrump often said that he would start his Oval Office tenure on “day one” by lowering the price of groceries.\n\nWhich brings us to a topic I will be watching very closely: How Trump handles the economy. Once considered one of his biggest assets, this “kitchen table” issue is looking increasingly like a liability. According to a recent Reuters poll, “Americans who think the economy is on the wrong track rose to 53%” in mid-February, which is up from 43% at the end of January.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump often said that he would start his Oval Office tenure by lowering the price of groceries on “day one.” He even held a press event next to tables filled with food items — oddly focused on breakfast foods like cereal — to rally against the rising costs of food. These days, however, Trump is virtually silent on pricing, preferring to bring up DEI or transgender issues to deflect from his failure to reverse the trend.\n\nDistraction is a tried-and-true tactic for Trump, and distraction is what I’m expecting in spades. From impugning enemies to flirting with potential new trade wars, the more noise Trump generates, the harder it is to focus on any one issue. Like, for example, the very real cost of eggs.",

        "title": "Three weeks later, White House endorses Hegseth’s ‘rookie mistake’",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As Pete Hegseth prepared to become defense secretary, his many critics made a persuasive case that the former Fox News host was, among other things, wildly unprepared to lead the Pentagon. Soon after, he took steps that helped prove his detractors right.\n\nIn fact, it was just a few weeks ago when the hapless Pentagon chief declared publicly that it was “unrealistic” to think that after the war in Ukraine ends, Russia wouldn’t keep portions of Ukraine it took by force. He added that Ukrainian membership in NATO simply wouldn’t happen.\n\nThe comments were certainly in line with the Kremlin’s wishes — a familiar problem with this administration — but they were also immediately recognized as a dramatic misstep: Before negotiations on a possible peace plan even began, Hegseth was already giving Moscow what it wanted.\n\nThe mistake did not go unnoticed. Not only were U.S. allies taken aback, but Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, chided the defense secretary for making a “rookie mistake.”\n\nHegseth quickly tried to walk back his comments, though three weeks later, it appears his “rookie mistake” has become the White House’s official policy. Politico summarized White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz’s appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz on the ultimate cease-fire deal, on “State of the Union”: “This will clearly be some type of territorial concession for security guarantees going forward. ... This needs to be a permanent end, not a temporary end. This needs to be European-led security guarantees going forward. Part of that is Europe’s contribution to its own defense. ... And then, you know, let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves — what type of support we provide or not is to be negotiated. But one thing is clear: We do not see Ukraine being a member of NATO.”\n\nLet’s recap. In February, Hegseth said that Russia will be able to keep parts of Ukraine that it took by force, and now in March, the White House national security adviser said Ukraine will, as far as the Trump administration is concerned, have to make “some type of territorial concession” to Russia.\n\nIn February, Hegseth said that Ukrainian membership in NATO was effectively off the table, and now in March, the White House national security adviser said effectively the same thing.\n\nIn fact, Waltz managed to go further than Hegseth, telling a national television audience the administration isn’t sure whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy should remain as Ukraine’s leader. “We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war,” Waltz said. “And if it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy’s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands.”\n\nIn other words, the diplomatic work has hardly even begun, but as far as the White House is concerned, Ukraine should be prepared to reward Russia with territory, give up on NATO membership, and even prepare to choose a new president more in line with Donald Trump’s wishes.\n\nIt’s one thing for an amateur Cabinet secretary to make a “rookie mistake.” It’s something else for an administration to embrace the error as U.S. foreign policy.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "While President Donald Trump has made a point of going after drug cartels, the Mexican government says U.S. gunmakers should be held liable for violence caused by their weapons in Mexico. The Supreme Court is about to hear arguments over whether Mexico can press its novel $10 billion claim.\n\nIt’s not a Second Amendment case before the court, which has sided with gun rights in recent years, but Mexico might face a skeptical bench all the same Tuesday.\n\nThe legal questions presented to the justices are:\n\nWhether the production and sale of firearms in the U.S. are a “proximate cause” of alleged injuries to the Mexican government stemming from violence committed by Mexican drug cartels.\n\nAnd whether that production and sale amounts to “aiding and abetting” illegal firearms trafficking because firearm companies allegedly know that some of their products are unlawfully trafficked.\n\nRepresented by Noel Francisco, a former Trump solicitor general, the gunmakers argue that Mexico’s claim is too attenuated because it’s based on “an eight-step causal chain — peppered by independent criminal actors and derivative sovereign harms — to try to link the lawful production and sale of firearms within the United States to the chaos ravaging Mexico courtesy of its drug cartels.” On the aiding and abetting point, they say the lawsuit is simply a challenge to “routine business practices.”\n\nBut Mexico argues that the gunmakers “deliberately sell their firearms in large quantities to known red-flag dealers” and “cultivate a market for their firearms in Mexico through design and marketing decisions.” And rather than simply arguing against routine business practices, Mexico alleges the companies “engage in unlawful behavior by intentionally facilitating the unlawful export of their firearms into Mexico through red-flag dealers and abnormal sales.”\n\nThe companies appealed to the justices after they lost in the federal appeals court. In that ruling last year, a panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Mexico’s lawsuit wasn’t barred by a federal law that otherwise insulates the firearms industry. The panel noted that Mexico has strict gun laws but that gun violence increased there after the U.S. ended its assault weapons ban in 2004.\n\nMexico’s complaint — against seven manufacturers and one distributor — detailed “a steady and growing stream of illegal gun trafficking from the United States into Mexico, motivated in large part by the demand of the Mexican drug cartels for military-style weapons,” the appellate ruling recounted. In turn, Mexico says it has suffered increased costs for medical, mental health and other services for victims and their families; increased costs for law enforcement and its judicial system; and diminished property values and business revenues.\n\nEven the appellate ruling in Mexico’s favor emphasized that it was only deciding that that government’s case was legally sufficient to move forward at a preliminary stage of litigation, and that whether the country could ultimately support its claims “remains to be seen.” But ahead of Tuesday’s oral arguments in Washington, it remains to be seen whether Mexico’s case can move forward at all.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in Donald Trump’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This post is part of the digital companion series to Jen Psaki’s “The Blueprint,” a new podcast examining where Democrats stand after big losses in 2024 and how they can win again. Below is an adapted excerpt from the March 3 episode featuring former Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nWhen I reflect on November’s election, two glaring omissions are missing from the Democratic Party’s messaging: acknowledgment and empathy. The lesson Democrats should take away from Kamala Harris’ loss to Donald Trump is the importance of meeting people where they are emotionally. If Democrats don’t do that, their message isn’t going to stick.\n\nJust consider my home state of Ohio. Over the years, deindustrialization, globalization and automation have just compounded, leaving many Ohioans in a tough spot. What I wish the Democratic Party would have said to these voters is simple: “I know you’re hurting but it’s going to take a little time for us to right this ship.”\n\nIt’s time to start building the case for the American people. But that doesn’t mean Democrats should run around with hair on fire over every issue.\n\nThe country just went through a pandemic. Disinvestment and deindustrialization decimated entire communities. Democrats know that — that’s why they’ve passed massive bills and implemented policy to try to help, investing in infrastructure, chip manufacturing, wind and solar energy, batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nBut the Democratic Party also needs to be honest with the American people. There’s no quick solution here. There’s going to be a lot of bumps along the way so Democrats should tell voters, “We’re sorry but we’re going to do this as quickly as we can.”\n\nThat’s a message I believe Joe Biden could have successfully communicated to voters. When he was still the party’s nominee, I wish he could have just said to the American people: “Hang with me. Trust me. I’ve lived in communities like yours. I’ve seen this before. It’s going to take a while to fix but just give me a chance.”\n\nDemocrats should have acknowledged the tough spot a lot of Americans were in. They should have shown voters they’re empathetic. But we also can’t just look in the past and talk about what the Democratic Party should have done. Democrats in Congress have a real opportunity to right that ship and show voters what the party really stands for.\n\nThere’s an analog element to this, members should be holding town hall meetings as often as they can. They need to get on the local news. It’s time to start building the case for the American people. But that doesn’t mean Democrats should run around with hair on fire over every issue.\n\nConsider the Trump administration’s recent cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. During my time in Congress, I voted on foreign aid. I sat on the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee. I know the value of those programs and how they save the U.S. money in the long run. But I don’t think Democrats want the discussion to be about how they’re defending foreign aid while people in their districts are still trying to figure out how to make ends meet and buy a carton of eggs. Why take the bait on that? Haven’t Democrats learned?\n\nDemocrats don't want the discussion to be about how they’re defending foreign aid while people in their districts are still trying to figure out how to make ends meet.\n\nMy advice for Democrats is just that: Don’t take the bait on everything coming out of this White House. Sometimes the smartest strategy is just to play possum. As Democratic strategist James Carville recently suggested in a guest essay for the New York Times, maybe the most daring political maneuver Democrats could implement right now is to “roll over and play dead.”\n\nJust let people see what the Trump administration is doing, uninterrupted. Then Democrats can point and say, “Wait, Trump didn’t say he would do that during the campaign. Trump said he would fix the economy. So why is he so focused on Ukraine? Why is he proposing tax breaks for billionaires?”\n\nOnce voters start seeing that and feeling the impact of Trump’s policies — like a mother who lost her child care because of budget cuts — they will start to realize he’s not delivering on his promises. That’s when Democrats can acknowledge, empathize and recapture the narrative to show the American people what their party truly stands for.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "UPDATE (March 2, 2025, 10:45 p.m. ET): On Sunday night, \"Anora\" was named the year's best picture at the 2025 Academy Awards. The honor capped a night of wins for the acclaimed film, including best actress, best director and best original screenplay.\n\nOn the surface, Sean Baker’s “Anora,” which has been nominated for multiple Oscars and has already won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, doesn’t seem interested in the present political moment. For example, the film’s Russian and Russian American characters show no discernible awareness of a war started by Vladimir Putin in 2022. But upon closer inspection, the movie probes a timely subject: the superwealthy and how they bend and distort civil society to their selfish whims.\n\n“Anora” is many things at once. It’s a meditation on sex work, a theme Baker examines with ingenuity in films like “Starlet,” “Red Rocket” and “Tangerine.” It’s a genre-toggler — shifting between a farcical rom-com, a gangster movie and an indie flick. It’s also a handy introduction to oligarchs and the obscene power they wield over institutions and the lives of working-class people.\n\n“Anora” subverts the feel-good vibe that movies like “Pretty Woman” radiated when portraying sex workers and their “kindhearted” johns.\n\nAt first, “Anora” appears to be stampeding to what in earlier decades would have been its Hollywood ending. We watch an exotic dancer from the outer boroughs named Ani/Anora (Mikey Madison) practice her craft at the local strip club. Because she speaks some Russian, her manager introduces her to a patron named Vanya (played by Mark Eydelshteyn).\n\nCute and absurdly wealthy, 21-year-old Vanya takes an apparent shine to Ani. He invites her to accompany him from one bender to another. Ani, with tinsel in her hair, seems to like him too. Still, she negotiates her price on each cocaine-fueled outing. Soon they end up in Las Vegas, where assorted onlookers (and Sean Baker’s giddy camera work) celebrate their shotgun wedding as fireworks discharge above.\n\nBut then “Anora” subverts the feel-good vibe that movies like “Pretty Woman” radiated when portraying sex workers and their “kindhearted” johns. Hours after the Vegas wedding, Vanya’s disapproving Russian parents spring into action. None too pleased about their son’s marriage to “a prostitute,” they dispatch their local goon squad to annul the union. The goons are an Armenian Orthodox priest (Father Toros, played by Karren Karagulian) and his two enforcers Garnick (also Armenian, played by Vache Tovmasyan) and the Russian “gopnick,” or “street thug,” Igor (Yuriy Borisov).\n\nGarnick and Igor break into Vanya’s Mill Basin mansion, a location with its own real-life connection to oligarchy. Vanya flees the scene, leaving his bride behind to deal with the intruders. What follows is no longer comedy, but every woman’s nightmare.\n\nHaving grown up in South Brooklyn, permit me to say that Mikey Madison does a spot-on imitation of a very pissed-off resident of Brighton Beach. Terrified Ani resists the goons and a wild melee ensues. After screaming “rape” at the top of her lungs, she is gagged. Father Toros — not, I surmise, a pro-choice advocate in his ministerial capacity — informs Ani that he will arrange an abortion should that be necessary.\n\nWhere, oh where is Vanya? Our boy has scampered off to other benders. His lushery encompasses Everything We Talk About When We Talk About Toxic Man-boys. Inability to establish emotional intimacy? Check. Obsession with video games? Yup. Construing sex as a sort of sprint? That too. We soon learn how little he cares about his wife. It is only the sex worker, Ani, who behaves as if marriage is a sacrament.\n\nFor oligarchs, by contrast, nothing is sacred. Vanya’s parents so control the priest Toros that he abandons a baby’s baptism midceremony to heed their call. If religious leaders will always play ball with the wealthy, so will the judicial system. In one crucial scene, these Russian nationals use their well-compensated American lawyer to set up an emergency annulment hearing in a New York City courtroom — which is the wrong place to annul a Nevada marriage. Now we are headed to Las Vegas. So are Vanya’s parents, who recently alighted from their jet and were rapidly processed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nVanya’s mother, Galina (Darya Ekamasova), makes it very clear to Ani that she must agree to legally terminate her marriage (“You are getting on this plane [to Las Vegas] and you are getting divorce”). Failure to do so, she threatens gleefully, will result in legal destruction. Imagine that! A wealthy foreigner feels so flush with power that she can use the American legal system to bully a working-class citizen. Naturally, Galina insinuates that Ani will be physically harmed if she refuses to comply.\n\nAs they part, Galina calls Ani “a disgusting hooker.” Ani bites back: “Your son hates you so much, he married one to piss you off.” Finally, the verbal smackdown we have been craving. That’s the stuff! Make the oligarchs squirm, Ani!\n\nBut oligarchs, as it turns out, don’t squirm. Ani’s sick burn immediately elicits uncontrollable laughter from Galina’s husband (Aleksey Serebryakov). His Papa Karamazov cackle, at once nihilistic and demented, reminds us of a truism: The superrich find all of this human suffering stuff fantastically funny.\n\n“Anora’s” final scene, which has been widely analyzed and debated, switches to art house mode. Ani initiates sex in a car with the “gopnik” Igor. She then breaks down and sobs over his supine body (the masculinity of the silent and supportive Igor might be usefully contrasted to Vanya’s loud, party-boy antics). The credits roll to the accompaniment of the loudest windshield wipers in the history of cinema.\n\nMadison and Baker insist that the meaning of this cryptic scene is up to the viewer. With that interpretive license granted, permit me to advance my own. Yes, Ani is likely crying over the betrayal, violence and feelings of powerlessness she’s endured. But in light of “Anora’s” portrait of the elite, maybe we could think of this sobbing woman as us — the U.S., weeping over what the wealthiest people in the world are doing to Americans.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "After watching the Oval Office exchange on Friday between President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance and their invited guest, Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy — I’m feeling some unusually visceral thoughts about my country. Betrayal, anger, embarrassment. Shame.\n\nTrump and Vance’s display in the Oval Office presented America to the rest of the world in a dramatically shameful light.\n\nWe already know the post-World War II order is over. The U.S. voted against its allies — and with the dictatorships of North Korea and Belarus — at the United Nations this week, opposing a resolution condemning Russia for invading Ukraine and occupying about 20% of its land. We’ve already heard Trump praise Russian President Vladimir Putin (many times) and call Zelenskyy a “dictator.” At a Cabinet meeting this week, Trump dismissed pleas from our NATO allies, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, to provide a “backstop” security guarantee in Ukraine, saying, “We’re going to have Europe do that.”\n\nBut Trump and Vance’s display in the Oval Office presented America to the rest of the world in a dramatically shameful light, making it plain that our government is no longer a worthy ally to liberal democracies around the world.\n\nZelenskyy expressed his appreciation to Trump for what he described as a “first step toward real security guarantees” for Ukraine, while also insisting there should be “no compromises” with the “killer” and “terrorist” Putin. Shortly after, Trump said that Zelenskyy ought to be more “grateful” and that his “hatred” for Putin makes it “tough to make a deal.”\n\nDeclaring himself a peacenik, Trump wrongly claimed his position — which is essentially to pre-emptively hand over Ukraine’s bargaining chips at the negotiating table, give Putin whatever he wants and take him at his word that he won’t reinvade — is more in line with Europe and the world’s sentiments than Zelenskyy’s.\n\nTrump, typically incoherent, rambled and repeated himself, so his vice president helpfully stepped in, saying Putin invaded Ukraine because then-President Joe Biden was weak and “the path to peace and prosperity is diplomacy.”\n\nZelenskyy, armed with facts to counter Vance’s MAGA rhetoric, noted that Putin first invaded Ukraine in 2014 (Trump incorrectly tried to correct him, saying it was 2015), and that he occupied Crimea and had been aggressing on Ukrainian territory ever since, including the four years of Trump’s first term. He also noted that Putin’s brutal 2022 invasion was itself a violation of a previous ceasefire — bringing further absurdity to the idea that Putin’s promises for “peace” can be trusted.\n\nThat was when Vance went into attack poodle mode, scolding Zelenskyy as “disrespectful” for trying to litigate the matter (i.e. telling the truth with verifiable facts) in front of the American media. Vance barked that he should be thanking Trump and not attacking the administration that is “trying to prevent the destruction of your country.”\n\nZelenskyy, remarkably, kept his cool, trying to get in a word over the shouts of Trump and Vance, warning them that even though the U.S. has an ocean between itself and Europe, that the country would “feel” the consequences of capitulating to Russia “in the future.”\n\nThat’s when it completely went off the rails.\n\nVance went into attack poodle mode, scolding Zelenskyy as ‘disrespectful’ for trying to litigate the matter (i.e. telling the truth with verifiable facts) in front of the American media.\n\nTrump bellowed, “You’re gambling with World War III” and attempted to humiliate Zelenskyy by saying “you don’t have the cards.” (The Ukrainian president replied that he’s not playing cards, he’s fighting a war.) Trump did a mock impersonation of Zelenskyy saying, “I don’t want a ceasefire!” Vance said Zelenskyy should have raised his objections in private and not in front of the media, adding, “We know that you’re wrong.”\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump what would happen if Putin broke a future ceasefire, the leader of the free world replied, “What if a bomb drops on your head right now?” before going on another incoherent rant about how Putin himself had suffered through the “phony witch hunt” and blamed the “Russia Russia Russia” investigation on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and “shifty Adam Schiff.”\n\nHe then turned to Zelenskyy and said, “I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States,” adding that if he doesn’t “make a deal” with Putin — the U.S. is “out.” Then Trump abruptly ended the press conference, noting “this is going to be great television.” As reporters were shunted out of the room, Vance reassuringly patted his boss on the arm.\n\nMinutes after the meeting ended, Trump posted to his social media site Truth Social: “I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” Trump also reportedly kicked Zelenskyy out of the White House.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Russia’s nominal president during the four years from 2008-12 when Putin pretended he wasn’t actually in power, posted to X: “The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is ‘gambling with WWIII.’”\n\nThose few minutes in the Oval Office are destined for the history books as a catastrophic and disgraceful moment in the story of America.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio — who sat silently next to Vance during the Oval Office fiasco — in February 2022 tweeted: “The people of #Ukraine are tough people who will NEVER accept being ruled by #Putin … Men, women, children, the elderly, they are going to fight … And they are going to maim & kill alot [sic] of Russians.” Now that he works for Trump, Rubio posted this on Friday: “Thank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before.”\n\nI’m not one for extensive self-flagellating over America’s many flaws. There are sins committed by this country’s government and its people, both recent and historic, that can never be fully atoned for — but which we should always be working to understand and strive to never repeat. Still, I don’t walk around life thinking the United States is irredeemable. ​​Far from it, actually. On the ledger of history and in broad terms, I believe we’ve been more right than we’ve been wrong.\n\nAnd yet, those few minutes in the Oval Office are destined for the history books as a catastrophic and disgraceful moment in the story of America.\n\nOur president, for almost a century known as the “Leader of the Free World,” has abandoned that post. We, as represented by our government, offer support only in mafia-esque transactional terms (“You give us your nation’s natural resources, and we’ll protect you, maybe”). Our leaders parrot the propaganda of an imperialist dictator who has acted as one of America’s primary adversaries over the past two and a half decades. And a democratic ally that has miraculously survived an existential attack by its nuclear-armed neighbor for three years was humiliated on the world stage and essentially blamed for fighting back against Putin’s aggression.\n\nMost perversely, the president’s admirers call this “diplomacy” and acting toward “peace.”\n\nIt’s too soon to say “we’re the bad guys,” but it’s not at all too soon to say “we’re on the side of the bad guys” — and historic alliances and mutual values mean nothing to us anymore. The “shining city on a hill” is a gangster’s paradise. It’s a shameful day for America.",

        "title": "The 'No Other Land' Oscars speech accomplished a remarkable feat",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Sunday's best documentary Oscar winner was surprising for a few notable reasons: “No Other Land,” a film co-directed by Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers, covers the forced expulsions of Palestinians from their homes in the occupied West Bank from a vantage point largely unexplored in the world of U.S.-focused Western cinema. Both the win itself and the acceptance speeches were rare and powerful moments, when a harsh worldly reality inserted itself into an affair that is by nature performative, even self-indulgent.\n\nThe win is even more noteworthy given the filmmakers haven’t been able to find a distributor to work with them in the United States, and yet it has grossed more than any of the other Oscar-nominated documentaries this year.\n\nWhile some rose in standing ovation, many attendees looked visibly nervous about what to clap for.\n\nThe documentary tells the story of Palestinians in Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in Hebron, being violently and systematically expelled through intimidation, from destroying water sources and other threats to assassinations. The film shows, among other devastating acts of violence, Palestinian co-director Basel Adra’s brother being killed.\n\nAdra and Israeli Yuval Abraham, two of the four co-directors, spoke in accepting the award. Adra and his family are from Masafer Yatta.\n\n“About two months ago, I became a father, and my hope to my daughter is that she will not have to live the same life I am living now, always fearing violence, home demolitions, forced displacement that my community, Masafer Yatta, is facing every day,” Adra said in his Sunday speech. “‘No Other Land’ reflects the harsh reality we have been enduring for decades and still resist as we call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.”\n\nAbraham added: “We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger. We see each other. The atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end; the Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of Oct. 7, which must be freed.”\n\nThe discomfort in the room was palpable. Practically no one clapped in response to Abraham’s comment about the destruction of Gaza and its people — to date over 46,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed, many of whom are women and children — whereas his comment about bringing Israeli hostages home was met with uproarious applause.\n\nNevertheless, Abraham persisted with his message:\n\n“When I look at Basel, I see my brother. But we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military laws that destroy lives, that he cannot control. There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people.\n\n“And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path. Why? Can’t you see that we are intertwined? That my people can be truly safe if Basel’s people are truly free and safe? There is another way. It’s not too late for life, for the living.”\n\nWhile some rose in standing ovation, many attendees looked visibly nervous about what to clap for.\n\nEven if for just a few moments, Adra and Abahams accomplished a remarkable feat: They forced attendees and viewers at home to confront a reality that so many Palestinians continue to face. Some in attendance may have chosen not to clap, but those who watched couldn’t escape acknowledging a reality so many have attempted to belittle or deny.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the Feb. 28 episode of \"Chris Jansing Reports.\"\n\nOn Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump met at the Oval Office to finalize the details of a minerals deal both parties agreed to earlier this week. This deal would grant the United States access to some of Ukraine’s critical minerals. Both sides entered the meeting feeling confident it was a good deal for both countries. But, instead of discussing that deal, the conversation quickly devolved into a shouting match, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance repeatedly accusing the Ukrainian leader of not being grateful enough to the United States.\n\nThat meeting was horrific. It was a tragedy for American national security interests, and it did neither side any good. Trump and Vance’s confrontation with Zelenskyy doesn’t make the American people any better off tomorrow than they were today. The only winner of this spat was Vladimir Putin. Russian officials and commentators close to the Kremlin are downright likely giddy about the outcome.\n\nTrump and Vance’s confrontation with Zelenskyy doesn’t make the American people any better off tomorrow than they were today.\n\nVance pleaded for the leader of another country to pledge his fealty to Trump and say thank you. But Zelenskyy didn’t need that reminder. Time and time again, he has thanked the U.S. and the American people for their contributions in helping Ukraine fight against unprovoked Russian aggression. It is also worth noting the vice president voted against aid to Ukraine during his time in Congress, so I’m not quite sure why he believes he should be thanked. Trump’s Republican Party also delayed approving the last package of assistance for six months, a delay that resulted in many Ukrainian soldiers dying on the battlefield.\n\nInstead of focusing on the present — what is good for American national interests today — Trump also felt compelled to relitigate his past.\n\nTrump and Vance’s performance was a distraction from the intended goal of Friday’s meeting. The deal Zelenskyy and Trump were supposed to sign was good for the United States and good for Ukraine. But instead of signing that deal, Trump ranted on about the past and criticized former President Joe Biden’s handling of the war and stretched back to his past grievances about other American politicians to 2016, complaining again about what he called the Russia hoax. (In 2016, Putin's intelligence services stole emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign and then published them with the aim of trying to influence the outcome of that election. The Justice Department later published a report on Russia's interference.)\n\nThe president should prioritize the country’s interests and stop reliving the past. What we saw in the Oval Office on Friday was not in America’s best interest.\n\nMoving forward, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his team should attempt to get U.S.-Ukraine relations back on track with their Ukrainian diplomatic counterparts, including signing the minerals deal and working to negotiate an enduring and just end to this horrific war. And they should do so behind closed doors, not in the Oval Office with cameras rolling.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump, in a joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, is expected to lay out his efforts to rapidly slash the size of the federal government in ways critics warn overstep his authority and threaten lasting damage.\n\nThe speech comes as Trump is making a sharp break from the previous administration, both on the international and domestic fronts. On Friday, Trump and Vice President JD Vance had a heated confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, rocking international relations and prompting concerns from critics that the White House is moving away from a democratic ally and hewing closer to Russia, an authoritarian adversary.\n\nTuesday's speech — Trump's first address to Congress of his second term — gives him the opportunity to further justify the shake-ups, both at home and abroad, to lawmakers and the public, and to preview what's coming next.\n\nThe president plans to use the address to tout what he views as his administration's initial successes, while also hosting guests the White House said benefited from Trump's first term, according to an administration official and a senior White House official.\n\nThe White House announced Tuesday morning that Trump and first lady Melania Trump's guests would include Marc Fogel, who was imprisoned in Russia before his February release; the family of Corey Comperatore, who was killed in an assassination attempt against Trump; and several people whose family members were victims of crimes allegedly committed by undocumented migrants.\n\nThe theme of Trump’s speech is “the renewal of the American Dream,” a senior administration official said.\n\nThe president is likely to focus his remarks on immigration, new tariffs and the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash budgets and fire federal workers, as well as the administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, a senior administration official told NBC News last week.\n\nThe president is also expected to call on Congress to provide additional funding for border protection and deportation efforts, a senior administration official said.\n\nElon Musk, who has spearheaded DOGE’s efforts despite not being the acting administrator of the initiative, will attend the speech, according to a White House official.\n\n“There will be a lot of surprises and a lot of made-for-TV moments,” another administration official said.\n\nIn his last joint address to Congress, his 2020 State of the Union speech, Trump awarded right-wing talk show host Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom — the country’s highest civilian honor. (Limbaugh, 70, died a year later.)\n\nTrump may not travel the country to amplify his message in the days after the address, as is typical for presidents, according to a White House official. The official said that the president and his team believe he’s accomplishing much of his agenda from the White House, adding that they were comfortable with him explaining his message to Americans from his perch in the Oval Office.\n\n“The priority is making sure business here at the White House is settled,” the official said, adding that post-address plans could change.\n\nInstead, Vance will travel outside of Washington to highlight the key points in the president’s address, a senior administration official said. He will begin with a trip to the southern border Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the vice president. Vance is expected to tour a processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, becoming the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the border so far during Trump’s second term.\n\nVance played a key role in Friday's combative meeting with Zelenskyy, an unprecedented public confrontation with a U.S. ally that was later cheered by current and former Russian officials. The move was slammed by Democrats, and many Republicans have since doubled down on the administration's criticisms of Zelenskyy.\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, will deliver the Democratic response to the joint address. The president's opposing party typically selects someone considered to be a rising political star to lay out the party's priorities and perspectives on the administration. Slotkin won Michigan's competitive open Senate seat in November, outperforming then-Vice President Kamala Harris in her presidential bid.\n\nSlotkin's speech will lean into her security background as a former CIA analyst, according to a source familiar with her speech, who said her background gives her a unique perspective on the Oval Office confrontation between Trump, Vance and Zelenskyy. The senator will also highlight a proactive economic vision and discuss what Democrats see as the path forward, the source said.\n\nMembers of Congress also typically invite guests to presidential joint addresses in an effort to highlight specific issues.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked the Democratic caucus to bring guests who \"have suffered under the Trump administration’s policies,\" according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson said that Schumer planned to bring two Medicaid recipients, a child with spinal muscular atrophy, whose survival was credited to a National Institutes of Health program, and two fired federal workers.\n\nTrump’s State of the Union speech in 2020 echoed campaign speeches, touting his economic and migration records just a month before the country ground to a halt because of Covid. At the end of his remarks, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president’s speech.",

        "content": "HONG KONG — China and Canada moved swiftly on Tuesday to retaliate against newly imposed U.S. tariffs, announcing their own levies on U.S. goods that could further disrupt the United States’ trade with its top three trading partners.\n\nA 25% U.S. tariff on almost all goods imported from Canada and Mexico took effect Tuesday just after midnight, along with an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The three countries together accounted for more than 40% of total U.S. imports last year and are also the top three U.S. export markets.\n\nChina will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, its government said, while Canada vowed tariffs of up to 25%. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced her country would enact countermeasures Sunday in response to the U.S. tariffs, adding that they would include both “tariff and nontariff measures.”\n\nThe new Chinese levies, which take effect on March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables, and dairy and fish products. Chinese state media had reported earlier that U.S. agricultural products would be targeted.\n\nChina says the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world’s two largest economies and they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.\n\n“The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\n“Pressure, threats and coercion are not the right way to engage with China. If the U.S. attempts to exert extreme pressure on China, it is simply targeting the wrong country and miscalculating its moves.”\n\nLin also said China had “taken strong measures” to help stem the international flow of fentanyl, which Trump has cited as justification for the tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, and that the U.S. was using fentanyl as an excuse to wage a trade war.\n\nIn addition to the new tariffs, China added 10 U.S. companies to its “unreliable entity” list and 15 to its export control list, mostly defense and intelligence firms with little exposure to the Chinese economy.\n\nBeijing is also filing a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the new 10% tariff, as it did in response to a previous 10% tariff that President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese goods starting Feb. 4.\n\nThe combined 20% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods comes on top of tariffs Trump imposed during his first term that were maintained and in some cases sharply increased by former President Joe Biden.\n\nCanada said it would move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) in American goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled.\n\nTariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, he said.\n\n“Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,” Trudeau said. “Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.”\n\nTrump, who had been threatening tariffs against Canada and Mexico since November, had accused them of failing to stem the international flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.\n\nWhile precursor chemicals for fentanyl are known to be shipped from China to Mexico, where they are processed into the deadly opioid which is then smuggled into the U.S., Canada says it has virtually no role in the international flow of fentanyl.\n\nAccording to U.S. customs data, only 0.2% of the more than 20,000 pounds of fentanyl seized at the U.S. border in the 2024 fiscal year came from Canada.\n\nTrudeau said Canada had nonetheless stepped up its drug enforcement efforts, resulting in fentanyl seizures from Canada dropping a further 97% from December to January, to 0.03 pounds.\n\nThe tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which Trump issued in an executive order he signed on Feb. 1, had been put on hold for 30 days after the leaders of both countries announced moves to tighten border security. They also include a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports.\n\nU.S. stocks tumbled Monday after Trump said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go ahead as planned, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 650 points, or 1.48%, and the S&P 500 dropping 1.76% for its worst day so far this year.\n\nIn Asia, Japan led declines in markets around the region with stocks falling almost 2%, CNBC reported. Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong were muted.\n\nThe U.S.-China tariff tit-for-tat comes as Chinese leaders and lawmakers gather in Beijing this week for the country’s biggest political event of the year, the National People’s Congress, where the ruling Chinese Communist Party will signal its priorities and goals for the year, including its approach to the Trump administration.\n\nThough China spared U.S. agriculture in its response to the first 10% tariff, “Trump’s impatient tariff offensive may be changing the calculus” and the U.S. farming sector “should start to feel the pinch,” said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing.\n\n“Sounds like it’s telling the U.S. that ‘we’re really going to hit you hard if you don’t stop,’” he said in an email.\n\nIn Canada, meanwhile, retaliation against U.S. tariffs could also extend to its individual provinces. Ontario Premier Doug Ford told NBC’s “Meet the Press NOW” on Monday that Canada would “respond like they’ve never seen before.”\n\nHe said he was prepared to retaliate by cutting off the transmission of electricity from his province to the U.S. as well as shipments of nickel, which “will shut down manufacturing because 50% of the nickel you use is coming out of Ontario.”\n\n“I’m sorry to the American people that your president has decided to do this,” Ford said. “I apologize, but he’s giving us no choice.”",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday weighs the fate of a lawsuit the Mexican government filed seeking to hold U.S. gun makers accountable for an epidemic of violence that officials in Mexico say can be traced to their products.\n\nThe justices will hear oral arguments on the gun companies’ request to throw out the lawsuit.\n\nThe case reaches the court amid increased tensions between American and Mexican leaders following the election of President Donald Trump, who has sought to stem the flow of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, citing drug trafficking and gang violence.\n\nTrump has announced new tariffs against Mexico that went into effect Tuesday, and his administration has designated Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum recently responded by saying her country would crack down on gun smuggling from the United States.\n\nDemocrats in Washington have introduced legislation intended to reduce the flow of guns across the border, which they estimate to total at least 200,000 a year.\n\nIn the 2021 lawsuit, the Mexican government accused Smith & Wesson, Colt and other companies of deliberately selling guns to dealers who sell products that are often later recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. The government seeks up to $10 billion in damages.\n\nGun dealers, lawyers for Mexico say in court papers, often sell the firearms to \"straw purchasers\" whose intent is to traffic the guns across the border. The companies even design certain weapons to appeal to cartel members, including a Colt handgun known as the Super El Jefe, the lawyers say.\n\nMexico has suffered as a result, the lawyers argue, with dozens of police officers and military personnel killed or injured. The lawsuit includes negligence and public nuisance claims.\n\nThe case at the Supreme Court involves two companies — Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms — with other manufacturers, including Glock and Colt, successfully having had claims against them tossed out.\n\nAt issue is a U.S. law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which restricts lawsuits against arms manufacturers. The gunmakers say the law applies to the Mexico lawsuit, meaning the entire complaint should be dismissed.\n\nIn court papers, lawyers for the gunmakers say the federal law protects them from any liability that results from \"criminal or unlawful misuse\" of a firearm by a third party.\n\n\"It is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred\" by the law, they wrote.\n\nMexico's legal team is focusing on a narrow exception to the liability shield, which allows a lawsuit to go forward if a company has \"knowingly violated\" a gun law and if that violation was a cause of the harm alleged in a lawsuit.\n\nMexico's lawsuit cannot meet those requirements, the companies say, as its arguments for liability rely on linking a long chain of independent third parties, including the gun dealers and traffickers, to the defendants.\n\nA federal judge had ruled for the manufacturers, but the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the case last year, saying the liability shield did not extend to Mexico’s specific claims.",

        "title": "Trump puts tariffs on thousands of goods from Canada and Mexico, risking higher prices",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has moved forward with a plan to put sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico, threatening a trade war with its closest trading partners — and higher prices for Americans on thousands of consumer goods.\n\nThe U.S. was scheduled to begin collecting a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, according to a draft public notice of the rules posted Monday. Canadian energy products would be levied at a lower rate of 10%.\n\nBusinesses ranging from automakers to alcohol producers have warned that the added costs for companies to import goods from Canada and Mexico will have wide-ranging implications across the American economy. While some companies will look to source their goods from other countries or move production to the U.S., those moves could take years.\n\nIn the meantime, companies have said they will have to pay the tariffs and then pick from two options: either pass the added costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices, or absorb the fees and either cut costs elsewhere or take lower profits.\n\nOn Monday, Trump also added an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China on top of the 10% tariff he put on Chinese goods last month, which includes products such as electronics, footwear, medicines and cosmetics. Those tariffs are in addition to tariffs already put in place during Trump's first term in office.\n\nTrump said he is putting the tariffs in place, in part, to pressure the countries into stopping undocumented immigrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. via their borders. More than 107,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2023, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe start of a back-and-forth retaliation\n\nThe move risks a tit-for-tat trade war with Mexico, Canada and China that could hurt U.S. businesses selling their products to those countries and upended one of the signature deals of his first term: the USMCA trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\n\nThat agreement, which Trump touted at the time as a negotiating victory, largely allowed products to move between the three countries tariff-free, similar to how they had for decades under the previous North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA. Under the terms of the deal, the agreement wasn’t supposed to be up for renegotiation until July 2026, but Trump’s move to impose new tariffs could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum indicated in remarks Tuesday that her country would respond by Sunday. In a news conference, she said the action would include \"tariff and nontariff measures.\" Sheinbaum also said that Mexico had already taken steps during the past month to crack down on drug gangs and trafficking flows.\n\nCanada will move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) of American goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled. Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods, including orange juice, peanut butter, wine and coffee, will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, he said.\n\n“Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,” Trudeau said. “Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.”\n\nChina said it will impose additional tariffs on U.S. goods March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables, and dairy and fish products. China said that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world’s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.\n\n“The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nTrump had previously threatened to place a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 before saying he was delaying those tariffs for a month, after the leaders of the two countries said they would be stepping up security at their borders. On Monday, Trump told reporters there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to negotiate on the new import duties.\n\nEconomists across the political spectrum have warned that the tariffs, which are paid by the U.S. company importing the goods, would increase what consumers pay for a range of goods, including vehicles, electronics, produce and lumber. Stocks fell nearly 2% Monday, the worst day since December.\n\n“The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy,” Michael Hanson, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in a statement Monday. “Stacking tariffs on household goods will also raise costs on American families, millions of whom have struggled through the worst bout of inflation in forty years.”\n\nSpecific sectors where the tariffs will be felt most\n\nAutomakers are among the industries that will feel the greatest impact from the tariffs, since vehicles and their components cross between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico multiple times during the production process. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned last month that the threat of the tariffs was creating chaos in the auto industry and could have devastating consequences for American automakers.\n\n“Let’s be real honest, long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen,” Farley said at an investor conference last month.\n\nThe tariffs could add as much as $12,000 to the price of a new car, according to a report from the Anderson Economic Group. The American Automotive Policy Council, the industry association representing GM, Ford and Stellantis, said they believe their vehicles and parts that meet the tariff-free requirements under the previously negotiated trade deal during Trump’s first term should be exempt from the tariffs.\n\n“Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market,” former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the association, said in a statement.\n\nThe Aluminum Association, which represents aluminum production and jobs in the U.S., said in February that the U.S. sources two-thirds of the primary aluminum it uses every year from Canada and about 90% of scrap metal from either Canada or Mexico. It added that U.S.-based smelters, even at full capacity, “cannot produce nearly enough metal to meet demand.”\n\nThe tariffs could also contribute to higher grocery prices since Mexico is one of the top suppliers to the U.S. of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years — an issue Trump pledged to tackle on the campaign trail.\n\nThe tariffs could also increase the prices of beer and alcohol imported from Mexico and Canada and hurt sales of U.S. spirits sold in those countries. The Distilled Spirits Council estimates that a 25% tariff on distilled spirits imports from Mexico and Canada could lead to a loss of more than 31,000 U.S. jobs. In 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, as well as $622 million worth of Canadian spirits, according to the association.\n\n“Tariffs on spirits products from Canada and Mexico will jeopardize the industry’s contribution to the U.S. economy,” the group said in a statement. “The North American spirits sector is highly interconnected and, as a result, tariffs on tequila and Canadian whiskey will harm U.S. spirits companies that have these products in their brand portfolios.”\n\nTrump has indicated that further tariffs will be on the way. He reiterated Monday that previously announced “reciprocal” tariffs would be coming April 2, and that tariffs on “external product” from the agriculture industry would also be imposed that day, without offering further details.\n\nLast month, Trump imposed a 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States from all countries, and raised his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%, without exceptions or exemptions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly cited tariffs as a tool he can use to raise revenue to pay for other domestic spending priorities and as a measure to pressure companies to relocate production to the U.S.",

Of the reported 221 cases of child rape, 66% of the victims were girls, while 33% were boys, it added.\n\nThe number of violations recorded against Sudanese children was 16% higher in 2024 than in 2023, which had already seen an increase of 473% from 2022 when the war broke out, the report said.\n\nDisplaced Sudanese girls near the Sudanese town of Tawila. AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe report contained distressing details that highlighted the gravity of the situation on the ground.\n\n“After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her,” read one testimony by Omnia, an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls.\n\nNearly two years of war between Sudan's armed forces controlled by the country’s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have left more than 30 million people — or more than half of the population — in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nOnce allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021.\n\nBut although they agreed to rule together, their alliance broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.\n\nMore than 12 million people have been displaced and tens of thousands of people have been reportedly killed, according to the U.N.\n\nWhile both sides have been accused of extensive human rights violations, a U.N. fact-finding mission in October found that the RSF was responsible for committing sexual violence on a large scale in areas under its control, including gang rapes, abductions and sexual slavery.\n\nIn January, the United States determined that the RSF had committed genocide in areas under its control.\n\nDamage from clashes between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces in Khartoum. Osman Bakir / Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nUNICEF, which has been providing safe spaces for children through emergency response rooms set up by local activists, said in the report that the outcome of sexual crimes against children was “devastating” due to the fact that victims have “few places to turn to for medical help.”\n\nWomen and girls are fleeing their homes and families to other cities where they end up becoming internally displaced and continue to face high risk of sexual violence, the report added.\n\n“Widespread sexual violence in Sudan has instilled terror in people, especially children,” Russell said, calling on all parties to the conflict to put an end to the violations.\n\n“These scars of war are immeasurable and long-lasting,” she added.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump traveled to visit natural disaster areas in North Carolina and California shortly after his inauguration, his team was concerned about a possible political disaster back in Washington. To defuse it would require a type of political dexterity he hadn’t always displayed during his first term.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., had raised concerns about defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who had communicated them to the White House. Hegseth couldn’t afford to lose Tillis’ vote, and Trump and his political team knew it.\n\nWalking into an Air Force One cabin filled with members of North Carolina’s GOP congressional delegation, Trump mused, “I hear your man Thom might not be with us,” according to a person who heard the remark. Trump then openly speculated, “Maybe someone will primary him. ... Do we have any takers?”\n\nThe threat wrapped in a joke was never deployed publicly. Instead, Trump took a different tack. Before the comment, his political team had set up meetings for Tillis with Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance. The behind-the-scenes pressure campaign then culminated with a meeting between Trump and Tillis the day of Hegseth’s confirmation vote.\n\n“We went into overdrive,” said a senior administration official who was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “Tillis just kept shrinking with each passing hour.”\n\nTillis ultimately fell in line and supported Hegseth, who squeaked through after Vance cast the tiebreaking vote to secure his confirmation. Notably, Trump never used what was his preferred tool of congressional diplomacy during his first term: a social media scolding.\n\nTrump’s more measured management of his relationships with Republican lawmakers — in which blow-ups still occur, but over the phone or behind closed doors rather than on social media — has been a critical difference between his two terms so far, according to eight sources on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue familiar with the dynamic between Trump and members of Congress.\n\n“He has stronger relationships on the Hill, so he doesn’t feel the need to be as — he’s a relationships guy,” a senior White House official said. “Now he has deeper, more personal relationships.”\n\n'He's proven himself to me'\n\nWhen Trump, a former Democrat, first arrived in Washington in 2017, few congressional Republicans knew him — or trusted him. And there were Republicans then who were unafraid to break with Trump’s actions or rhetoric, from Sens. John McCain and Bob Corker to Reps. Charlie Dent and Mark Sanford.\n\nEight years later, Trump is regarded as the most dominant GOP figure in generations, those vocal critics are out of office, and he is deploying a softer touch with the loyalists who remain. Unlike the start of his first term, he knows Republican lawmakers on a first-name basis, passes out his cellphone number to them and frequently hosts them and their spouses at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\n“He was my fifth choice for president, and I was wondering what we were getting into” in 2016, recalled Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., who endorsed Marco Rubio in that primary campaign. “And then I became a convert to support him because of the policies that he had. It’s not what he said; it’s what he did. He’s proven himself to me.”\n\nWilson then pulled out of his jacket pocket a photo of him with Trump at Mar-a-Lago from a visit in January.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who publicly pushed back against Trump’s stolen election claims in 2020 and endorsed another candidate for president last year, said in an interview last Thursday that Trump “is prepared this time” around.\n\n“He’s had four years to plan his first six months in office. And it has been a very successful first two months for sure,” he said.\n\nThose relationships were tested last week when Trump used his pull with House Republicans to break an impasse over a budget resolution that’s critical to advancing his border security, energy and tax agenda through Congress.\n\nTrump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., were getting squeezed on both sides — from GOP moderates fretting about potential Medicaid cuts that could harm their constituents and conservative fiscal hawks furious that the proposed spending cuts weren’t deep enough.\n\nTrump and Johnson began assuaging concerns of the moderates. One, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., said he spoke to Trump twice last week, including just hours before the vote. Van Drew said that he called Trump and left a message for him last Tuesday and that Trump called him back soon after. Rather than insist that Van Drew vote for the budget blueprint, he recalled, Trump asked him whether he thought the votes were there to pass it. The two talked about protecting Medicaid for low-income Americans, many of whom voted for Trump.\n\n“Waste, fraud and abuse. Yes, we all want to get rid of that. But the issue ... are people that are disabled, people that are in nursing homes, people that are working poor, a lot of all these people are wearing red hats,” Van Drew said. “They’re the new Republican Party, the populist conservative party. [Trump] understands that.”\n\nBut the quartet of conservatives dug in and refused to move off their opposition. During a dramatic standoff on the House floor, Trump began calling three of the remaining conservative holdouts: Reps. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, and Victoria Spartz, R-Ind. The House Republican leadership team is using its “phone a friend lifeline with caution,” said a source involved in discussions, who didn’t want Trump to waste political capital so early in a perilous process.\n\nTrump spent 25 minutes on the phone with Spartz, who walked away from the conversation telling Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., she would still vote against the resolution, according to a person who witnessed the conversations. Trump and Spartz then had a second phone call.\n\n“We had a productive conversation, and he reassured me that he will back me up when things are important for me and he agrees with me,” Spartz said, adding that Trump recognized strong-arming her would backfire. “President Trump is a smart man. He would know better than that, you know, that it would never work, right? ... President Trump was very nice. ... He cares a lot, and he always listens.”\n\nRepublicans said Trump’s defter behind-the-scenes approach most likely has to do with his paper-thin majority in the House. The budget resolution passed 217-215 — a single-vote margin — and he’ll need nearly every Republican on board again to pass the reconciliation package later this year. Publicly bashing and alienating opponents, lawmakers said, could risk blowing up his entire agenda.\n\nThat’s a marked difference from 2017, when House Republicans had a 241-194 majority. That year, 20 House Republicans bucked Trump and voted against a partial repeal of Obamacare. McCain would later kill the package in the Senate.\n\nAnd that December, a dozen Republicans voted no on a sweeping tax bill that Trump later signed into law.\n\nTrump’s “got to be real careful, which he is not. There will be problems on the hard right, with pragmatic members and others,” said Dent, the former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who voted against the Obamacare repeal bill in 2017 and resigned from the House a year later. “No margin for error.”\n\n'It's like night and day'\n\nTrump also genuinely likes the Republican leaders of both chambers, administration sources say, a dynamic that was absent during his first stint in the Oval Office with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the former Senate leader and House speaker, respectively.\n\nAfter the bill to repeal Obamacare collapsed, Trump posted on social media that McConnell, R-Ky., “couldn’t get it done.” And when McConnell blamed Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Trump called him a “dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack.” As for Ryan, R-Wis., Trump has called him a “weak and ineffective leader” and a “curse to the Republican Party.”\n\nCongressional Republicans acknowledge Trump is also generally more accessible to them in his second term, with many in possession of his personal cellphone number.\n\n“It’s like night and day from what it was in the first term,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told NBC News.\n\nCornyn also credited Trump’s “sensible” chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who has long-standing relationships with many Republicans on Capitol Hill and can help lawmakers “navigate” disagreements with Trump.\n\n“She hears the good, bad and the ugly,” Cornyn said.\n\nTrump also has another tool at his disposal in managing Congress: billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who spent more than a quarter-billion dollars on the 2024 elections.\n\nMusk’s embrace of Trump has been a net positive in his relationship with Congress, a senior administration official said, “and not just by the threat his very existence imposes” — referring to his ability to spend massive sums of money on an election.\n\nMusk’s penchant for fiery posts on his X platform requires White House management. But he has proven to be a valuable ally for Trump, having recently spent 45 minutes on the phone lobbying a “difficult” senator on behalf of an administration priority, the senior official said.\n\n“We just have to be cognizant that if he’s not on the same page, we could risk something being said at any time that sets us back,” the official said.\n\nStill, there are limits to Musk’s influence. During the Republican Senate leadership race last year, in which all votes were private, Musk endorsed Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., against Thune and Cornyn. Shortly after Musk’s posts on X, Senate Republicans were flooded with voicemails, emails and even protesters at their hometown offices. Scott ended up losing the vote in the first round, anyway.\n\nFor now, Trump’s primary threats against fellow Republicans remain on ice or, at least, only implied. But he has a massive war chest and a long memory, and that won’t always be the case.\n\n“At the end of year one there’s a scorecard,” the senior administration official said. “We’ve either achieved everything we need to and people have taken the right votes and are in good graces ... or at the end you’ve made yourself persona non grata.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea — The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened Tuesday to launch high-profile provocations in response to the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier in South Korea and other U.S. military activities, which she slammed as “confrontation hysteria of the U.S. and its stooges.”\n\nThe warning by Kim Yo Jong implies that North Korea will most likely ramp up weapons testing activities and maintain its confrontational posture against the U.S., though President Donald Trump has said he would reach out to Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.\n\nIn a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong accused the U.S. of clearly showing “its most hostile and confrontational will” to North Korea with the deployments of the USS Carl Vinson and other powerful U.S. military assets and U.S.-South Korean military drills this year.\n\n“The DPRK is also planning to carefully examine the option for increasing the actions threatening the security of the enemy at the strategic level to cope with the fact that the deployment of U.S. strategic assets in the Korean Peninsula has become a vicious habit and adversely affects the security of the DPRK,” she said, using the acronym of North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nHer statement suggests North Korea may test-launch powerful missiles designed to strike the mainland U.S. or American military bases in the region, observers say.\n\nSouth Korea’s Defense Ministry warned later that it was ready to repel any provocations by North Korea based on a solid military alliance with the U.S. A ministry statement called Kim Yo Jong’s warning “sophistry” meant to justify her country’s nuclear development and future provocations.\n\nOn Sunday, the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group arrived in South Korea, the latest temporary deployment of a U.S. strategic asset aimed at displaying the firmness of the U.S.-South Korean military alliance in the face of North Korean threats and strengthening interoperability of the allies’ combined assets. The U.S. carrier’s arrival came four days after North Korea conducted cruise missile tests, its fourth missile launch event this year.\n\nNorth Korea views arrivals of such powerful U.S. military assets in South Korea as major security threats and often responds with missile tests.\n\nNorth Korea has not directly responded to Trump’s overture, but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since the start of Trump’s second term in January.\n\nExperts say Kim Jong Un is not likely to embrace Trump’s outreach anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia’s war against Ukraine with supply of weapons and troops. They say Kim could consider returning to diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country’s current booming cooperation with Russia.\n\nKim and Trump met three times from 2018 to 2019 during Trump’s first term to discuss the future of North Korea’s nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.",

Horry County Fire Rescue, the fire agency with local jurisdiction, said residents should beware of low visibility caused by smoke through Tuesday morning.\n\nState and local firefighters were aided by two Black Hawk helicopters and a Chinook from the South Carolina National Guard, the guard said. The aircraft have dropped an estimated 60,000 gallons of water on the Carolina Forest fire, it said.\n\nResidents who evacuated were allowed to return Sunday evening, Horry County Fire Rescue said in a statement. They had to contend with smoke so thick and dangerous that the agency advised motorists to stay off roads in the fire zone.\n\nGov. Henry D. McMaster, who declared a fire-related state of emergency on Sunday, counted the state's battle with wildfire as a victory.\n\n\"The report that I've received so far, there have been no buildings lost and no lives lost,\" he said. \"It was a great performance.\"\n\nSmoke rises behind homes as firefighters battle a blaze in the Carolina Forest neighborhood of Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Sunday. Sean Rayford / Getty Images\n\nThe state was also the site of four other active wildfires, two of which started Monday in Williamsburg County, about 50 miles west of Myrtle Beach, Doug Wood, spokesperson for the Forestry Commission, said in an email.A state summary of fires shows 108 blazes have been reported and 4,357 acres have burned in the last seven days. Wood previously said the vast majority of dry weather blazes broke out Saturday, when gusts stronger than 25 mph were reported in the Myrtle Beach area and temperatures reached into the mid-70s, according to National Weather Service data.\n\nOn Sunday, volunteers gathered at Carolina Forest Community Church, where some firefighters were coordinating their efforts and taking breaks, to grill up hamburgers and hot dogs for the first responders, according to NBC affiliate WMBF of Myrtle Beach.\n\nThomas Garavito and Jillian Patton, of Murrells Inlet, a community about 20 miles down the coast, dropped off ready-to-eat fare from Dunkin'.\n\n“I saw this morning that they were doing a good job of keeping the fires away from their homes, and, again, I just want to show our gratitude for that,\" Garavito said.\n\nIn North Carolina, fires in all four of the state's national forests remained active Monday, with burned areas estimated to total nearly 500 acres, according to the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nNo containment estimate was available. The Forest Service said in a statement Monday that crews were excavating containment lines and using \"mechanized equipment to manage heavy fuel loads partly due to Hurricane Helene,\" which wreaked destruction in the Southeast last year as it moved inland to Tennessee and North Carolina, creating catastrophic flooding and killing more than 200 people in its path.\n\nHelene’s tropical precipitation and destructive winds may have also indirectly aided North Carolina’s fifth active fire, burning near the city of Tryon.\n\n“Parts of the wildfire are burning in vegetative debris that resulted from blow down during Hurricane Helene,” Philip Jackson of the North Carolina Forestry Service said by text.\n\nThe 593-acre blaze was 63% contained, he said near the end of the workday. Evacuations in the area were voluntary.\n\n\"N.C. Forest Service personnel are working to strengthen and widen containment lines while mopping up in steep mountainous terrain,\" Jackson said.\n\nNo injuries or structure loss have been reported, and the fire's cause was under investigation.\n\nWhile such an eruption of fires is rare, Wood, the South Carolina Forestry Commission spokesperson, told NBC affiliate WCBD of Charleston over the weekend that the region is in peak fire season weather. \"It’s not unheard of,\" he said.\n\nIn Georgia, 10 weekend fires remained active Monday, with 2,535 acres burned, seven structures and two vehicles damaged and no containment, said Wendy Burnett, a spokesperson for the Georgia Forestry Commission.\n\nIn Tennessee, the state Agriculture Department's fire summary showed six active fires remaining from a spate of weekend blazes. Those incidents accounted for less than 10 acres of burned brush, according to the summary, but 762 acres have burned over a seven-day stretch, the department's data show.\n\nWinds in the region from Georgia to North Carolina have died down, but federal forecasters say that because relative humidity remains below 25%, the risk of fires will remain high through Tuesday night.\n\n\"Elevated fire weather conditions continue into Tuesday as breezy winds and warmer temperatures return,\" said the National Weather Service forecast office for Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nA cold front will bring rain to the Carolinas late Tuesday into Wednesday, federal forecasters said. But it will also be preceded by an increase in winds that could fan any remaining flames, the Columbia office said in its forecast discussion published Monday.\n\nBecause the cold, wet system will move through the region rapidly, the forecast office said, \"only brief relief from fire weather concerns are anticipated.\"",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on America's largest trading partners, raising the prospect that a host of everyday goods could become more expensive for U.S. consumers.\n\nJust after midnight, 25% duties came into effect against Canada and Mexico. An additional 10% levy was imposed on Chinese goods on top of another 10% tariff that took effect earlier this month. A lower 10% duty was placed on Canadian energy imports.\n\nThe U.S. imports billions of dollars worth of goods from those nations, across a range of sectors. Among the common Mexican imports that may see price increases: cars, fruits, vegetables, beer, liquor and electronics. And from Canada: potatoes, grains, lumber and steel.\n\nEY Chief Economist Gregory Daco said last month that agricultural products, as a major category of trade between the U.S., China, and Mexico, would be among the products most directly affected by any new duties.\n\nTuesday morning, Target CEO Brian Cornell warned produce items at the big box retailer may see price increases. Target relies heavily on Mexican produce during the winter months, he said, and the tariffs could force the company to raise prices on fruits and vegetables as soon as this week.\n\nCornell said prices could rise for produce like strawberries, avocados and bananas.\n\n“Those are categories where we’ll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,” he told CNBC in an interview after Target released its fourth-quarter earnings. “If there’s a 25% tariff, those prices will go up,” Cornell added.\n\nBest Buy CEO Corie Barry issued a similar warning Tuesday, noting China and Mexico are the company’s top two supply-chain sources.\n\n“Trade is critically important to our business and industry, the consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex,” Barry said. “We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.”\n\nWith deeply intertwined automotive supply chains between the three countries, cars and auto parts are likely to get pricier to bring into the U.S., too.\n\nS&S Automotive services cars in Secaucus, New Jersey, where owner Keith Scaglione says tariffs would likely make the cost of parts like oil filters more expensive, making even routine fixes costlier for consumers.\n\n\"Oil changes, mainly that'll be the first noticeable one, an average oil change on most vehicles is now anywhere between $50 to $80. It's probably going to end up over $100,\" Scaglione said in an interview before the tariffs were imposed.\n\nThe tariffs could be the beginning of a policy war, with tariff rates at risk of ratcheting as affected countries retaliate.\n\nAlready, Canada announced phased levies on a total of $107 billion worth of U.S. goods in response to Trump's move, though it has not specified exactly which items they would apply to. China, meanwhile, said it would soon impose tariffs of as high as 15% on American agricultural products including chicken, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy products.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum indicated in remarks Tuesday that her country would respond by Sunday.\n\nThe White House has previously indicated there was a \"retaliation clause\" added to the measures.\n\n\"So that if any country chooses to retaliate in any way, the signal will be to take further action with respect to likely increased tariffs,\" the White House said.\n\nIt was not clear Tuesday morning if additional actions from the White House were in the offing. A White House representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump is enacting the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to respond to “extraordinary threat,” which Trump has identified as a fentanyl and drug crisis that he alleges China, Mexico, and Canada facilitate.\n\nAppearing on CNBC Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick doubled down on the threat posed by fentanyl flows, even as official U.S. data show a recent significant downturn in interdictions.\n\n“This is not a trade war, it’s a drug war,” Lutnick said.\n\nLutnick also warned a general \"reset\" was coming with all of America's trade partners, alluding to previously unveiled \"reciprocal\" tariffs Trump plans to impose on nations with historically friendly ties to the U.S., especially in Europe.\n\n“These countries have used us and abused us, and that’s going to change,\" Lutnick said, adding: “Trillions and trillions of dollars are going to come back to America.”",

        "content": "Dolly Parton's husband, Carl Thomas Dean, whom she was married to for nearly 60 years, has died, she said. He was 82.\n\nThe music icon, 79, on Monday posted a statement confirming Dean’s death on Instagram.\n\n“Carl Dean, husband of Dolly Parton, passed away March 3rd in Nashville at the age of 82. He will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending. He was survived by his siblings Sandra and Donnie,\" the statement said.\n\n“Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can’t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy.”\n\nThe star asked for privacy for the family as they grieve Dean’s death.\n\nParton and Dean, a businessman from Nashville, married in 1966 after meeting two years prior and mostly kept their relationship out of the public eye.\n\nIn a November 2023 interview for her Apple Music show, “What Would Dolly Do? Radio,” Parton opened up about why they kept their relationship so private.\n\n“Carl has never been in the limelight and all, never wanted to be in it. He don’t like it,” Parton explained at the time. “He went to one thing with me early on when we first married to a BMI Song of the Year (event), and he came out there taking off his tuxedo, his tie and all that and said, ‘Don’t ever ask me to go to another one of these damn things because I ain’t going.’”\n\nShe added, “I never asked him and he never did.”\n\nParton famously penned one of her biggest songs, “Jolene,” which was released in 1973, about a woman flirting with her husband.Speaking about the inspiration behind the song in an interview with NPR in 2008, she said, “She got this terrible crush on my husband. And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us — when I was saying, ‘Hell, you’re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don’t believe we’ve got that kind of money.’ So it’s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.”\n\nIn May 2016, the longtime couple decided to renew their vows. She told Rolling Stone that they had an intimate ceremony at their Nashville-area home.\n\n“I got all dressed up in the most beautiful gown you’ve ever seen and dressed that husband of mine up. He looked like a handsome dude out of Hollywood,” she gushed. “We had a few family and friends around. We didn’t plan anything big at all because we didn’t want any kind of strain, any kind of tension, any kind of commotion, so we planned it cleverly and carefully. We just had a simple little ceremony at our chapel at our place. We just had just a few people who needed to be there to make sure they got the pictures and the few things that we needed.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "California's attorney general on Monday announced the unsealing of an indictment charging 30 detention officers assigned to a Los Angeles-area juvenile hall with child abuse for allegedly allowing and sometimes encouraging so-called gladiator fights among youths.\n\nAt the heart of the grand jury indictment is the allegation that officers stood by as children and teenagers at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall engaged in the fights, the attorney general's office said in a statement. The detention center is in Downey, about 13 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe office of Attorney General Rob Bonta said there were at least 69 fights in the second half of 2023, with 143 children and teens between 12 and 18 years old involved. Some fights, Bonta's office said, resulted in physical injury.\n\nOfficers, Bonta said in the statement, were allegedly “overseeing ‘gladiator fights’ when they should have intervened.\"\n\nThe defendants took advantage of the vulnerability of the victims and their own position of trust, his office said.\n\n\"Let today’s charges be a warning for all those who abuse their power,\" Bonta said. \"The California Department of Justice is watching, and we will hold you accountable.\"\n\nThe fights came to the attention of the attorney general and state investigators after video of one of the altercations was \"leaked\" in January 2024, Bonta's office said. Speaking to news media by video, he described the violence.\n\n“The footage, which was later circulated widely by the media and on social media, shows one youth in the detention center being attacked by a series of other youth who come at him one by one as detention officers stand by watching,” Bonta said in video aired Monday by NBC affiliate KCRA of Sacramento. “The officers look more like referees or audience members at a prize fight, not adults charged with the care and supervision of young people.”\n\nStacy Ford, president of the L.A. County Deputy Probation Officers Union, AFSCME Local 685, which represents the 30 officers in labor negotiations, said in a statement that the organization \"will do everything in our power\" to support the officers.\n\n\"Every American is innocent until proven guilty,” Ford said. “Our members are entitled to this same presumption of innocence and deserve to be treated with fairness and due process, just as they provide to those in their custody.\"\n\nHe said juvenile detention officers are tasked with keeping peace and order among children and teens often accused of violent crimes.\n\n“Despite these challenges, our professional peace officers remain committed to maintaining the highest level of professionalism,\" he said. \"We will continue to advocate for the safety, rights, and integrity of our members.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment, each of the 30 officers is charged with felony child abuse under a California law aimed at those who enable child endangerment, with those convicted of the charge facing two to six years in state prison.\n\nOne of the 30 faces an additional count of misdemeanor battery for allegedly using force and violence against an unnamed subject, according to the document.\n\nThree of the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, according to the indictment. It alleges two of them allowed some of the fights, knew beforehand when and where they would happen, and told new detention officers to watch but not report the bouts.\n\nProsecutors alleged the third joined the other two in allowing some of the fights, one of the which resulted in a broken nose for an unnamed victim.\n\nOne of the three told new officers that nine fights on Dec. 22, 2023, in a unit of the juvenile facility, were an example of how the detention employees controlled the children in their care, according to the indictment.\n\nTwenty-two of the defendants were arraigned Monday. The rest will be arraigned April 18, the attorney general's office said.\n\nAll the defendants have been placed on unpaid leave, the county's probation department said in a statement. In April 2024, probation chief Guillermo Viera Rosa said officers involved in the alleged abuse captured on video had been removed from duty as he sought investigation from an outside agency.\n\n“We will not tolerate misconduct like that depicted in the video,” the chief said at the time.\n\nThe next month, he said 66 officers had been placed on leave amid an internal investigation. Viera Rosa said he would root out the \"culture of violence, drug use, neglect and sexual misconduct in the nation’s largest probation agency,\" according to a county statement at the time.\n\nSaying the indictment announced on Monday is an example of the need for change in the culture of county probation officers, L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn said she would support firing any officers found guilty.\n\n\"The young people in Los Padrinos are not only in our custody, they are in our care,\" she said in a statement. \"It is unacceptable that probation officers who were entrusted with this responsibility would use their power to abuse these kids.\"",

        "title": "Inflammation is a 'double-edged sword': How to protect against chronic disease",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Why do our ankles swell when they’re sprained or does our skin turn red — or inflamed — when it’s scraped?\n\nThat quick response is caused by inflammation — and it can save your life.\n\nAt its core, inflammation is the “response of the body to an illness or an injury to try to restore health,” said Dr. Robert Shmerling, a rheumatologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School who helped author a report on inflammation.\n\nInflammation has come under fire for its link to a variety of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease and even allergies. Longevity experts even see reducing chronic inflammation as key to healthier aging.\n\n“It’s a classic double-edged sword,” said Dr. David Hafler, a neurologist and professor of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine.\n\nInflammation is necessary for survival, and without it our bodies wouldn’t be able to fight off intruders like viruses and bacteria. A sore throat, for example, turns red and is painful because the immune system is fighting the infection to prevent it from spreading, which doctors call acute inflammation, said Dr. Moshe Arditi, a pediatrician and director of the infectious and immunological diseases research center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\n“Localized immune response in the acute stage — to a limited extent — is all beneficial inflammation,” he said.\n\nThe discovery of inflammation dates back centuries to the Roman encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celcus, one of the first people to define it. Celcus described the core signs of inflammation in Latin as rubor, tumor, calore, delore. The terms translate to redness, swelling, heat and pain, which still hold true.\n\nAt a microscopic level, acute inflammation includes our bodies’ sending fluid, proteins and white blood cells to the sites of infections or injuries, which help fight foreign pathogens and promote healing.\n\nWhile inflammation can be lifesaving in the short term, there is another type of inflammation, chronic inflammation, that can damage the body over the long term.\n\nWhat causes chronic inflammation?\n\nSeveral risk factors make your body more likely to have chronic inflammation — including obesity, which promotes a low-level inflammatory state throughout the body, tobacco smoking and diet.\n\nDr. Thaddeus Stappenbeck, chair of inflammation and immunity at the Cleveland Clinic, suspects the modern American diet is a major source of chronic inflammation.\n\nProcessed foods, refined sugars, trans fats and excessive consumption of red meat are associated with increased inflammation. The Food and Drug Administration banned trans fats in 2015, and they were finally removed from snacks, bread, cookies and other baked goods in 2018.\n\n“I suspect that there’s more people with underlying, chronic inflammation than there were in the past,” Stappenbeck said. “I think about the way we’ve shifted our diet where we eat a lot of chemicals that we are not adapted to consume, and these have a number of effects on our intestines.”\n\nShmerling said, “Lack of exercise, lack of sleep, too much stress, all of those are lifestyle factors associated that are pro-inflammatory.”\n\nWhat are symptoms of inflammation?\n\nSigns may vary, but they include:\n\nJoint pain that doesn't improve.\n\nFatigue.\n\nConstipation\n\nDepression.\n\nWeight loss, regular exercise and avoiding highly processed foods can reduce levels of inflammation in the body, Shmerling said. Studies have suggested that following a Mediterranean diet, largely plant-based with an emphasis on whole fruits and vegetables, can reduce levels of inflammation.\n\n“It’s often not an on/off kind of switch,” he said. “We don’t have perfect ways to measure inflammation after making a lifestyle modification, but inflammatory markers can improve with lifestyle changes.”\n\nHow chronic inflammation affects the heart\n\nAn estimated 129 million people in the United States have at least one chronic disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The prevalence of chronic disease has grown by about 7 million people every five years, according to estimates from Stanford University.\n\nThe causes of chronic disease are complicated, but experts are increasingly convinced that inflammation is playing a role.\n\n“There’s a fair amount of consensus that a lot of the chronic diseases we see now in higher prevalence than in the past could well be related to chronic inflammation,” Shmerling said.\n\nWhat comes first — the inflammation or the disease? When the body is in an inflammatory state, it can start to destroy the very things it needs to function, such as our vital organs and blood vessels.\n\n“Ongoing inflammation may lead to heart disease and building of plaque in the blood vessels, which can lead to heart attack and strokes,\" said Arditi, of Cedars-Sinai. “Long-term inflammation in your brain may lead to development of neurodegenerative diseases by damaging neurons and interfering with normal brain function.”\n\nAutoimmune disorders like lupus or multiple sclerosis are also linked to chronic inflammation as the immune system starts to attack various parts of the body in friendly fire.\n\n“The body is not distinguishing properly between itself and an outside intruder or a pathogen,” Shmerling said. “There’s chronic inflammation that’s ongoing and quite damaging.”\n\nDiseases including Parkinson’s and even diabetes all have inflammatory components to them, Stappenbeck said. Because of inflammation’s close relationship to a host of diseases, he’s not surprised by patients coming in asking to be checked for it.\n\n“I think there’s a desire from patients to say, ‘Can you actually detect this in me earlier, before I get super sick?’” he said.\n\nIs there a test for chronic inflammation?\n\nThere are blood tests for inflammation, but they aren’t perfect. They don't provide clear answers about where the inflammation may be lurking in the body.\n\nThere can also be false positives. That's why experts say the tests must be interpreted along with symptoms.\n\nOne of the most common tests is called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a blood test that measures the level of certain proteins that correlate with the amount of inflammation in the body.\n\nAnother test assesses c-reactive protein (CRP), a protein the liver produces in response to inflammation.\n\nBecause of the limitations, Shmerling doesn't recommend that healthy people with no symptoms be routinely screened for inflammation.\n\n“There can be normal inflammation tests even when inflammation is present, and sometimes the tests are abnormal even when it doesn’t seem there is any inflammation present,” he said. “So they’re not perfect.”\n\nStappenbeck agreed.\n\n“I don’t think there’s much of a role for it, actually,” he said.\n\nThere is some potential for a test called hs-CRP, a more sensitive test that can find smaller increases in c-reactive protein in the blood. High levels of that protein in the blood have been linked to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSome argue that this test should be done routinely, just like checking cholesterol, to determine who is more at risk of heart attacks and stroke.\n\nThe evidence, however, has been mixed, which is why the test isn’t widely performed.\n\n“There are people who are so low-risk or so high-risk that it’s very unlikely the CRP is going to help you,” Shmerling said. “There are subsets of people, maybe at moderate risk, where a CRP for cardiac risk could be helpful.”",

        "content": "One of Dolly Parton’s biggest hits was inspired, in part, by her late husband, Carl Thomas Dean.\n\nThe country music icon said her 1973 smash hit “Jolene,” which went to the top of Billboard’s country music chart, came about thanks to a bank teller who had a little thing for Dean.\n\n“She got this terrible crush on my husband,” Parton told NPR in 2008.\n\n“And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kind of like a running joke between us when I was saying, ‘Hell, you’re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don’t believe we’ve got that kind of money.’ So it’s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.”\n\nParton, who also said she came up with the name of the song after meeting a young fan at a concert, announced on Instagram on March 3 that Dean had died at the age of 82. The couple were married for nearly 60 years.\n\n“Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can’t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,” the 10-time Grammy winner wrote, while adding her husband died in Nashville and “will be laid to rest in a private ceremony.”Dean, who worked in the asphalt industry, met Parton at a laundromat in 1964. They married two years later in Georgia when they were both in their early 20s. While Parton has enjoyed immense fame throughout her career, Dean was not often seen, remaining out of the public eye.\n\n“He went to one thing with me early on, when we first married, to a BMI Song of the Year,” she said on Apple’s “What Would Dolly Do?

        "content": "WASHINGTON — Most of America “springs forward” Sunday for daylight saving time and losing that hour of sleep can do more than leave you tired and cranky the next day. It also could harm your health.\n\nDarker mornings and more evening light together knock your body clock out of whack — which means daylight saving time can usher in sleep trouble for weeks or longer. Studies have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the March time change.\n\nThere are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep.\n\nWhen does daylight saving time start?\n\nDaylight saving time begins Sunday at 2 a.m., an hour of sleep vanishing in most of the U.S. The ritual will reverse on Nov. 2 when clocks “fall back” as daylight saving time ends.\n\nHawaii and most of Arizona don’t make the spring switch, sticking to standard time year-round along with Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Worldwide, dozens of countries also observe daylight saving time, starting and ending at different dates.\n\nSome people try to prepare for daylight saving time’s sleep jolt by going to bed a little earlier two or three nights ahead. With a third of American adults already not getting the recommended seven hours of nightly shuteye, catching up can be difficult.\n\nWhat happens to your brain when it’s lighter later?\n\nThe brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we’re more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens.\n\nMorning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync.\n\nSleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline, obesity and numerous other problems. And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and metabolism.\n\nHow does the time change affect your health?\n\nFatal car crashes temporarily jump the first few days after the spring time change, according to a study of U.S. traffic fatalities. The risk was highest in the morning, and researchers attributed it to sleep deprivation.\n\nThen there’s the cardiac connection. The American Heart Association points to studies that suggest an uptick in heart attacks on the Monday after daylight saving time begins, and in strokes for two days afterward.\n\nDoctors already know that heart attacks, especially severe ones, are a bit more common on Mondays generally — and in the morning, when blood is more clot-prone.\n\nResearchers don’t know why the time change would add to that Monday connection but it’s possible the abrupt circadian disruption exacerbates factors such as high blood pressure in people already at risk.\n\nHow to prepare for daylight saving time\n\nGradually shift bedtimes about 15 or 20 minutes earlier for several nights before the time change, and rise earlier the next morning, too. Go outside for early morning sunshine that first week of daylight saving time, another way to help reset your body’s internal clock. Moving up daily routines, like dinner time or when you exercise, also may help cue your body to start adapting, sleep experts advise.\n\nAfternoon naps and caffeine as well as evening light from phones and other electronic devices can make adjusting to an earlier bedtime even harder.\n\nWill the U.S. ever eliminate the time change?\n\nEvery year there’s talk about ending the time change. In December, then-President-elect Donald Trump promised to eliminate daylight saving time. For the last several years, a bipartisan bill named the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent has stalled in Congress; it has been reintroduced this year.\n\nBut that’s the opposite of what some health groups recommend. The American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine agree it’s time to do away with time switches but say sticking with standard time year-round aligns better with the sun — and human biology — for more consistent sleep.",

        "content": "A scientist with a doctorate who issues tsunami alerts. A hurricane-hunting flight director. A researcher studying which communities will get flooded when a storm strikes.\n\nThey were among the more than 600 workers the Trump administration cut last week when it eliminated about 5% of the workforce at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I was considered an essential employee, part of a 24/7 safety watch,” said Kayla Besong, a physical scientist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which sends tsunami alerts. Until Thursday, she was part of a team of 12 who programmed the systems that determine whether parts of the U.S. coastline are at risk and issued alerts accordingly. Two people were required to be working at all times, she said.\n\nThe mass firing — of educated, specialized workers who viewed themselves as the next generation of scientists protecting life and property — could stretch NOAA’s workforce thin and hinder work on programs designed for public safety, former agency employees and leaders said.\n\nClimate change is making weather disasters more common. Last year, NOAA counted 27 billion-dollar disasters, which resulted in the deaths of 568 people in the United States. It was the second-highest number since 1980, when NOAA began keeping such records, even accounting for inflation.\n\nAt the same time, meteorologists and forecasters say they’ve faced public vitriol and harassment despite increasingly accurate predictions. Some blame the politicization of climate change and the proliferation of conspiracy theories.\n\nA White House official said “an extensive process” was conducted before the NOAA layoffs to ensure “mission critical functions” weren’t compromised. The cuts were part of the Trump administration’s mass firings of federal workers, which have spurred protests and legal challenges. Some researchers have warned that cuts to health and science agencies, in particular, could walk back or stall years of progress.\n\nA NOAA spokesperson said the agency wouldn’t comment on the layoffs.\n\n“We are not discussing internal personnel and management matters. NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public,” Susan Buchanan, a National Weather Service public affairs officer, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nFormer agency officials railed against the cuts, saying they threaten public safety during weather crises.\n\n“Every office in NOAA was hit by these indiscriminate, misguided, ill-informed terminations,” said Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator under then-President Joe Biden. “We’re coming into tornado season; hurricane season isn’t too far behind. We’re going to have, still, some winter storms. We’re going to have floods, droughts.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress, too, spoke out against the moves at a news conference Friday and at a rally Monday at NOAA headquarters.\n\n“Without the warnings of extreme weather events, hurricanes, tsunamis, other things, people will die and others will suffer greatly, including huge property loss. And that’s why this is such an assault on our public safety,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said at the news conference.\n\nBesong, 30, began her job as a physical scientist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii in September. The center provides alerts to the military and U.S. embassies and issues them for vulnerable coastlines in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. During tsunami events, Besong said, she would call military installations with information about risk and contact local emergency managers.\n\n“I was using my skills to actively help people,” said Besong, who has a doctorate in atmospheric science. “You’re directly using your skills to improve systems that protect and warn against hazards.”\n\nShe added that tsunami alerts rely on complicated, bespoke computer programs that analyze seismic and tidal data.\n\n“When there’s any large displacement in the Earth’s crust or water, we get notified and have to determine if there’s an earthquake large enough to create a tsunami or if a tsunami has been generated by other means,” Besong said. “I’ve been developing these skills for over 10 years. I’m an excellent programmer. Their systems are very niche, and they require people who know how to program.”\n\nEven before the latest cuts, she said, the office was strapped for resources and needed to develop a new generation of workers.\n\n“You do need a high level of expertise to understand and jump in on these systems,” Besong said, saying the job required a doctorate or a master’s degree and additional experience.\n\nLike Besong, Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeling specialist, also has a doctorate and spent years developing specialized computing skills. Hazelton helped develop NOAA’s next-generation hurricane modeling program, called HAFS, as an academic at the University of Miami.\n\nHe joined NOAA’s Environmental Modeling Center on the October day when Hurricane Milton hit the Florida coastline, then was fired Thursday. His work involved using supercomputers to advance hurricane forecasting.\n\n“We’re working on the physical approximations, trying to make it more accurate, so the forecast error continues to shrink, the cone continues to get smaller and so the people who are going to get hit get more lead time,” Hazelton said, referring to the graphic that shows the probability of a hurricane’s path. “There’s a lot of expertise that got lost on this.”\n\nThe HAFS model indicated that both hurricanes Helene and Milton would intensify rapidly, which helped forecasters predict more powerful storms and get more strident warnings out, Hazelton said.\n\n“We do work people use to keep themselves safe,” he said.\n\nSome data that Hazelton’s models rely on is at risk, as well. Kerri Englert, a NOAA flight director and meteorologist, was also fired Thursday. During “hurricane hunter” missions, flight directors advise pilots about the safest routes and how to get the best data for modeling. Englert was onboard a “hurricane hunter” aircraft during hurricanes Beryl, Helene and Milton last year.\n\n“We do put our lives on the line to go do these missions,” Englert, a Navy veteran, said. “It is a passion. I have spent 10 years chasing after this job.”\n\nBefore the cuts, Englert said, NOAA had aimed to have 10 flight director positions filled. But after she and another were terminated, that left just six. Now, she said, if one flight director is sick, there will be fewer “hurricane hunter” flights.\n\nDuring hurricane season, meteorologists rely on the one-of-a-kind data the flights gather, which feeds into hurricane models.\n\n“It’s going to increase the uncertainty,” Englert said. “You’re looking at additional evacuations.”\n\nOther fired workers were helping develop modeling tools that haven’t yet been rolled out at scale. The cuts may affect the tools’ quality and implementation timelines, they said.\n\nEvan Belkin, a doctoral student at the University of Albany, was hired at the National Weather Service in 2023 as part of a program that allows people still finishing degrees to work at the agency.\n\nHe worked at the service’s Northeast River Forecast Center and in its weather forecast office in Albany, New York, until last week. He helped launch weather balloons and was part of a team building a flood inundation mapping tool.\n\nThe tool, still under development, is designed to model which areas in a community will flood in heavy rain, including the extreme events that climate change is making more likely. Early versions of the maps were distributed to some local emergency managers, Belkin said, and the goal was to expand the services nationwide by 2026.\n\nThe model accurately predicted that flooding in Montpelier, Vermont, in July 2023 would reach the state Capitol building — Belkin visited to confirm the model got it right.\n\nHe was among several students and employees working on the tool who were let go, he said.\n\n“When you don’t have people and bodies to verify how accurate the model depictions are, you’re not going to be successful,” Belkin said. “Without people and bodies, this flood inundation mapping project is going to go down the s----er.”\n\nThe cuts also reduced the number of meteorologists taking public calls and putting out forecasts.\n\nOn the morning he was fired, he said, Francis Tarasiewicz, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Rhode Island, started work at about 5:30 a.m., putting together four- to seven-day forecasts, as well as forecasts specifically for airports.\n\n“We’re not the waste,” Tarasiewicz said.\n\nSpinrad said at the news conference that every NOAA office had had reductions, including about 30% of the staff with the Office of Space Commerce.\n\n“One of the functions of that office is to keep the roughly 30,000 objects in space from colliding with each other,” he said.\n\nSpinrad also warned that the loss of workers would be likely to push back seasonal outlooks and hurricane forecasts.\n\n“Some of those products may end up being delayed in delivery just because they don’t have the staffing power,” he said.\n\nSome typical NOAA and NWS services went dark almost immediately.\n\nShortly after the firings, the National Weather Service office in Kotzebue, Alaska, said it would suspend releasing weather balloons.\n\nNOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory also said it would stop posting to social media.\n\n“Due to a reduction in staff, NOAA GLERL’s communications services will be taking an indefinite hiatus,” it wrote on X.\n\nNOAA’s external affairs team said on its website that the entire office had been eliminated.\n\n“People’s lives are in danger. It’s not an exaggeration to say that. I’m worried. We’re coming up on tornado season, hurricane season, and that is just scratching the surface,” said Rachel Brittin, who until Thursday was the deputy director of the office. “These huge cuts to NOAA’s staff are going to affect the ability for NOAA to be effective.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "On the battlefield, \"Ukraine is not going to run out of bullets tomorrow,\" said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst who is the head of intelligence at the Le Beck consultancy. \"But a suspension of military aid would have a very noticeable impact on the conflict that would become visible in the coming months.\"\n\nThe United States has given $65.9 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That's far more than any other country (the second highest is Germany’s $13 billion, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.) In fact, the U.S. contributions are so large that they roughly equal all other nations’ aid put together.\n\nA significant part of the American aid has been to supply Ukraine with air defense missiles, which not only protect Kyiv's military positions but also civilians in cities, which have been targeted by the Russian military. It is also crucial in giving Ukraine artillery, which it has used to slow Russian advances over the winter. And it has been central in training the Ukrainians how to use this equipment, maintaining and repairing it, as well as providing transport.\n\nEurope could pick up some of this slack, but it will be near impossible to do so completely, Horowitz said. And while removing American support would not cause issues immediately, in time \"they will become quite crippling,\" he added.\n\nLikewise, though Ukraine receives some ammunition from Europe, \"uncertainty about future U.S. aid shipments could lead Ukraine to begin rationing ammunition,\" said Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a Philadelphia-based think tank.\n\nUltimately this \"will lead to higher casualties for Ukrainian forces,\" he told NBC News.\n\nIn the skies, Ukraine relies on the U.S. to supply the interceptor missiles for its Patriot air defense systems. \"Without them, Ukraine will have more difficultly protecting its cities from Russian missile strikes,\" Lee said.\n\nIt also has no effective replacement for the multiple guided missiles, which the U.S. supplies for its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, which have been used to great effect against Russia.\n\nAdded to that, \"Ukraine already faces a manpower shortage, so the loss of U.S. aid will pose greater challenges for Ukraine,\" Lee said.",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES — Every morning for 47 years, Gaily Cowart’s mother woke up in her sun-filled bedroom overlooking a lush garden and the San Gabriel Mountains beyond.\n\nThat garden and much of her mother’s home are now covered in ash and soot after the Eaton Fire ripped through Altadena on Jan. 7, destroying more than 9,000 residences in the foothill community north of downtown Los Angeles. At least 17 people died, and thousands more were displaced.\n\nCowart’s childhood house survived the flames but is surrounded by charred homes and razed businesses near what used to be Altadena’s bustling business corridor. The neighborhood off Lake Avenue sustained some of the worst damage in one of two major fires that swept through Los Angeles County in January.\n\nThe garden of Gaily Cowart's childhood home in Altadena, Calif. Courtesy Gaily Cowart.\n\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires displaced about 150,000 residents, and many remain in rentals and hotel rooms nearly two months later. Survivors whose homes are standing face ballooning smoke remediation and restoration costs, as well as insurance companies that are lowballing payouts even though some offer smoke damage coverage.\n\nNBC News spoke with seven homeowners whose houses survived the fires. Six of them paid for smoke damage coverage through insurance, and one did not have the option through the state’s insurer of last resort.\n\nStill reeling from the destruction, they now face tens of thousands of dollars in costs or more to deep clean and remediate remaining toxins inside their homes. They anticipate being displaced for months as they begin rebuilding.\n\n“It’s really tricky being in a home that did not burn down,” Cowart said. “There’s such a gray area with insurance thinking, ‘Just wipe everything down and it’ll be back the way it used to be.’ But it’s like, 'No, I’ve got soot and ash that I can see with my eyes.'”\n\nThe insurance industry has long been fraught in California, where wildfires are getting bigger and deadlier every year. Major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies or are refusing to renew existing ones to offset skyrocketing costs across much of the state.\n\nResidents were blindsided last year when State Farm, California’s largest insurer, announced it would drop coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments. It blamed costs associated with inflation, catastrophe exposure, reinsurance and regulations for its need to protect its bottom line.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Altadena resident Andrea-Marie Stark emerged from a State Farm information tent frustrated by the lack of progress in getting her remediation estimate approved. Service was scheduled to start Monday on her three-bedroom, two-bathroom ranch-style house facing Eaton Canyon, where the fire was first reported.\n\nBut State Farm had not yet approved the estimate, which ranged from $80,000 to $100,000 to pull insulation from the walls, remove harmful particles from all surfaces and replace furniture, clothing and appliances exposed to excessive smoke and ash.\n\n“I’m worried I’m going to lose my place in line,” Stark said of the approval delay. “And then I could lose a place to live.”\n\nAndrea-Marie Stark and her husband in their smoke-damaged home in Altadena. Courtesy Andrea-Marie Stark\n\nStark’s house is one of several that survived the inferno on her block, but its proximity to the flames meant everything inside was coated with a thick layer of soot. Christmas decorations turned gray in the ash, and her clothing has the strong odor of smoke.\n\nA charred smoky smell lingers on Stark's street. A neighboring house has been razed to its foundation, with only the chimney left standing. In the distance, green moss and leaves sprout amid the burned branches and fallen limbs of Eaton Canyon.\n\nStark and her husband evacuated to a friend’s home the night of the fire after they secured their four rabbits, five chickens, three cats, a dog and a horse in their crates. They have been jumping from friend’s home to friend’s home ever since. They hoped to return to Altadena by mid-March after having booked a smoke remediation company that said it could complete the work quickly.\n\nBut State Farm had not responded to her claim for two weeks, and she worried she would need to pay for the remediation herself, plus rent if her appointment had to be rescheduled.\n\nIn an emailed statement, State Farm said it is “committed to paying what we owe, promptly, courteously, and efficiently.” As of Feb. 26, it has received more than 11,750 fire and auto claims related to the fires and paid nearly $2.2 billion to customers, it said.\n\nTo cope with the anxiety associated with surviving a catastrophic event, Stark and her husband started a Monday night support group for residents whose homes are still standing. It is a way for people to speak openly about what few others can understand.\n\n“Safeness is an internal feeling. Safety is external, and they’re both ruptured right now,” said Stark, a trauma-trained counselor. “I don’t want to express this to someone without a home, you know, because I don’t want to disrespect their experience and make them think that I’m not grateful. That’s called survivor’s guilt.”\n\nThe smell in Marcie Habell’s Altadena home nauseates her. A remediation company recommended taking it down to the studs to fully restore it. She cannot imagine returning to it right now, let alone sitting on her fabric couch or using any of her towels or linens.\n\n“I can be in my house for less than five minutes,\" said Habell, whose home is one of just two standing on her block. \"It’s insane that it happened, and then on top of it, the way that insurance is behaving just compounds the tragedy.”\n\nShe has been quoted upward of $22,000 just for toxicity testing, and she expects rent could run $4,000 to $4,500 a month. That's on top of paying her mortgage if her insurance company does not agree to cover the full cost, she said.\n\n“We are getting zero guidance from anyone for those of us who happen to have a standing home and are surrounded by the apocalypse,” she said.\n\nMichael Sollner, California's deputy insurance commissioner, said in a statement that \"smoke damage is real and insurance companies must investigate claims properly, not deny them outright or pressure homeowners into accepting less than they are owed.\"\n\nMore than 33,710 insurance claims related to the Los Angeles-area fires have been filed, and nearly $7 billion in claims have been paid, according to state Insurance Department.\n\nGaily Cowart and her mom, Faye Howard, whose home in Altadena is just one of two left standing on her block. Courtesy Gaily Cowart\n\nCowart is handling her mother’s smoke damage claim from Dallas, where she has been living for more than a decade. She flew to Los Angeles on Jan. 8 to pick up her mother from a friend’s house and took her back to Texas. Cowart’s mother, Faye Howard, has early onset Alzheimer’s and struggles with being in a new place. But Cowart fears her old neighborhood is too toxic to return to.\n\nInitial estimates to remediate the Spanish-style two-bedroom, two-bathroom house started at $55,000. A landscaper bid $3,000 to restore the garden and remove potentially toxic soil. Including furniture removal and buying new clothing, Cowart fears, the cost to fully restore her mother’s home and everything in it could quickly top $100,000. Howard’s Allstate adjuster has not finalized their payout or agreed to pay long-term rent while Howard remains displaced, Cowart said.\n\n“My mom doesn’t understand why she can’t go home,” Cowart said. “Just on a basic human level, no one has told us what we’re supposed to be doing.”\n\nAllstate was not available for comment Monday.\n\nRob Rhatt, an insurance analyst for Lending Tree, said it is “frustrating and not surprising” that insurance companies are slow to handle smoke damage claims. Unlike damage from fires, which is structural and clearly visible, damage caused by invisible smoke does not neatly fall into most categories. It requires professional testing, cleaning and restoration with expensive outside vendors.\n\nSimply put, homes in high wildfire-risk areas are bad for business.\n\n“These catastrophic losses have really cut into their profitability,” Rhatt said of insurance companies. “It’s not just cutting into their profitability where they’re making less money, but it’s actually threatening their solvency to the point where they’re losing money insuring homes in California.”\n\nPacific Palisades resident Ian Hardcastle said he never had the option to fully insure the 2,600-square foot home he shared with his wife and 14-month-old child near Temescal Gateway Park, where the Palisades Fire sparked.\n\nAfter they bought their house in 2021, he signed up for the California FAIR Plan, which provides coverage for those who cannot obtain insurance from private companies, and hoped any wildfires would stay tucked in the mountains and canyons, as they had historically.\n\nBut on Jan. 7, a wind-driven inferno ripped through the state park behind his house and devastated the surrounding neighborhood. His home was overwhelmed with billowing smoke and toxic ash for several days. Hardcastle can stand to be inside for only a few minutes at a time.\n\nHis adjuster quoted $1,826 for remediation, but a $5,000 deductible means Hardcastle will receive no payout for work that could cost much more.\n\n\"This, this little plot of land was our special happy place, so we're happy it's still here,\" Hardcastle said Thursday as he toured his property. \"We want to come back, but again, we don't know when that will be.\"",

No details related to the circumstances of his death were released.\n\nNantwi, was being held at the Mid-State Correctional Facility to the north of Utica, where he was awaiting trial for allegedly shooting and killing two people in two separate incidents within 30 hours in in 2023.\n\nHe was already serving a five-year sentence for the second-degree possession of a criminal weapon related to a 2021 shooting.\n\nNantwi's death comes two weeks after six prison officers were charged over the death of Robert Brooks, who was beaten by guards in December at the Marcy Correctional Facility — just a few hundred yards away — in an attack Gov. Kathy Hochul described as “brutal” and “sickening.”\n\n“Upon hearing of the death of a 22-year-old Messiah Nantwi incarcerated individual at Mid-State Correction Facility on Saturday, March 1st, The Office of NY Attorney General and the New York State Police were notified,” the Corrections Department said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe statement added that it is up to the county medical examiner to determine the cause of Nantwi's death and whether to make the result of its investigation public.\n\nNew York State Police said in a statement that it was investigating “the circumstance surrounding his death” with the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS).\n\nStan German, executive director of the New York County Defender Services, said that while Nantwi was accused of serious crimes, he had a violent upbringing and faced “significant mental health challenges.”\n\n“True, he was incarcerated, but he was still entitled like all of us, to basic human dignity and safety,” German said in a statement to The Associated Press. “Instead, he suffered a violent senseless death at the hands of state corrections officers operating within a toxic culture that our society mainly ignores.”\n\nNew York Civil Liberties Union Director Donna Lieberman said in a statement that this was not an isolated incident.\n\n“We are extremely disturbed by the reported killing of another incarcerated person in Marcy at the hands of correction officers and call for full transparency and justice,” she said.\n\n“No one should die in custody at the hands of correction officers, who are charged with the safety and security of individuals in DOCCS’s facilities.”\n\nNantwi's death comes as ongoing strike action continues to affect operations at New York prisons, despite a deal struck between Hochul and the prisons trade union.\n\nThe Corrections Department declined to comment to questions about the case from the AP.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against his critics and accused the media of working with the “deep state” as he rejected the establishment of a court-appointed inquiry into the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.\n\nIn a speech at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Netanyahu, without providing any evidence, suggested the findings would be “predetermined” and told lawmakers it was “important and crucial to investigate in depth the events of Oct. 7 and what led up to it,” but thought a court-led probe would be biased.\n\n“What do you think? That we’re children?” he shouted into a microphone as some his fellow politicians jeered and shouted at him during Monday night's debate.\n\nIsrael’s High Court of Justice ruled in December that Netanyahu’s government should hold a Cabinet hearing on whether to form a state commission of inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Hamas-led attacks, looking at why the country’s military was unable to prevent the deadly assault.\n\nBut it has since agreed to requests from the government to delay updates to the court about its stance on the creation of such an inquiry.\n\nLawmakers, including former war Cabinet minister Benny Gantz, have long called for a state commission to be set up.\n\nBanging on the podium in the Knesset, Netanyahu acknowledged that the “public demands the truth” about the Hamas attacks and he called for the formation of a commission that would “investigate everything,” including alleged leaks from Cabinet meetings and confidential parliamentary sessions.\n\nHe went on to blast the media, accusing news outlets of “full cooperation with the deep state” and of creating “scandals.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Lev Radin / Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\n“The cooperation between the bureaucracy in the deep state and the media didn’t work in the United States, and it won’t work here,” he said, aping the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the idea that clandestine networks operate within governments, acting to manipulate or control policy.\n\nNetanyahu’s rivals were quick to condemn his comments. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said the events of Oct. 7 would “always belong” to the Israeli prime minister, adding that “there was never a government here that had so many reasons to ask for forgiveness.”\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the debate reflected a “total disconnect” by a “disastrous government.”\n\nAfter conducting its own investigation into the deadly attacks, Israel’s military acknowledged last month that it had misjudged Hamas’ intentions and underestimated the militant group’s capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMore than 48,000 people have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza since then, according to health officials in the enclave.\n\nHowever, many Israelis believe the failures surrounding the attacks extend beyond the military and Netanyahu has faced calls to take responsibility for his country’s apparent lack of preparedness.\n\nAt least 65% of Israelis said they believed the most appropriate method to investigate the attacks was a State Commission of Inquiry, according to a recent poll conducted by the Jerusalem-based Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research.\n\nSurveyed between from Jan. 28 to Feb. 2, just 17% of the 604 Jewish and 151 Arab respondents said they supported the idea of a government-appointed commission of inquiry.\n\nNetanyahu has nonetheless maintained that he will answer difficult questions, but only after the war that has consumed the Middle East for almost a-year-and-a-half comes to an end.\n\nHis outburst came amid growing fears over the future of the fragile ceasefire between his government and Hamas, and as Israel faces mounting criticism for halting the entry of aid and goods into the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar doubled down on that decision Tuesday, blaming Hamas for the pause — which came as families across Gaza marked the month of Ramadan — after the militant group refused to accept a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to expedite the delivery of $4 billion in military aid to Israel and reverse a partial arms embargo introduced by the Biden administration.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "LONDON — Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine’s single most important backer, the United States.\n\nEither Zelenskyy “needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was “up to the Ukrainians to figure that out.”\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed “a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.” He told CNN that “if it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy’s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.”\n\nMeanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn’t sure if the U.S. “can ever do business with Zelenskyy again.” He said that Ukraine’s leader “either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.”\n\nCritics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow’s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine’s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv’s domestic political divisions during wartime.\n\nAn Ukrainian serviceman carries an artillery shell to fire toward Russian positions near Donetsk on Sunday. Roman Chop / AP\n\nKremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an “unprecedented event” that showed “Zelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.” The exchange was part of Ukraine’s “refusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,” he said. “Only a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.”\n\nStill, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week’s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.\n\n“If they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,” Zelenskyy told British media. “It’s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.”\n\nTrump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine’s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy “a dictator without elections.”\n\nMore and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.\n\nOther polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy’s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President JD Vance meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nZelenskyy “was elected in 2019 with the large margin,” said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn’t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are “a bit populistic” because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.\n\nOne man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s former top military commander — known as the Iron General — whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey — higher than his boss, the president.\n\nBut in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying “no.”\n\nStill, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.\n\nOne soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: “The only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.”\n\nYevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party, said her leader has “made it clear he’s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.”\n\n“Honestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,” she added. “Our defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy’s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.”\n\nTrump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy’s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would “lose in a landslide.”\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy’s political rivals.\n\nAlexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv.",

The annual event, known as Mobile World Congress, attracts more than 100,000 people for product pitches, fund-raising appeals and debates about the future of technology.\n\nThe fresh U.S. tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico — the three largest U.S. trading partners and crucial cogs in many supply chains — were a common topic of conversation around the sprawling expo center. European companies are heavily represented at the event, and some executives tried to frame the rising trade tensions as an opportunity for Europe, whose sizable population and economy has often been held back by slow growth and a lack of competitiveness.",

There, he defended a cannabis company called Hemp Bombs against claims about its CBD products, which are derived from the cannabis plant. He also defended Whole Foods Markets in a lawsuit claiming that it sold a CBD product that misled users to believe it would reduce pain.\n\nThe F.D.A. has taken the position that CBD is unsafe to add to the food supply and has gone after companies in situations it deemed high risk. The agency began an effort to determine how it would regulate CBD but in early 2023 concluded that Congress needed to step in.\n\nThe deadly bowel condition associated with infant formula for preterm infants has also been debated at the F.D.A.

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, shown during Flag Day ceremonies in Mexico City on Feb. 24, has seen her approval ratings rise.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico, stood underneath a giant Mexican flag and before troops at a military installation in Mexico City. It was Flag Day last month and she used her speech as an opportunity to, figuratively and literally, rally around it.\n\n“Mexico must be respected,” she said, adding later: “Its people are brave. We know that when our people unite around their history, their country and their flag, there is no force in the world that can break their spirit.”\n\nTimes had changed, she said: Mexico would not bow down to foreign governments.\n\nGiven the circumstances — President Trump’s steep tariffs against Mexico went into effect in the first minutes of Tuesday — Ms. Sheinbaum’s optics were fitting. As Mr. Trump once again targeted Mexico, using the hammer of tariffs as a negotiating tool, a sense of Mexican nationalism has been strengthened.\n\nThe Mexican government and businesses have rekindled a “Made in Mexico” campaign. Some Mexicans have called for boycotts of U.S. companies and products, while others have put together lists of Mexican stores and brands to support instead of American ones.\n\nMs. Sheinbaum is frequently featured on the front page of local newspapers with members of the country’s military or in front of a giant Mexican flag. Private companies have taken out nationalistic advertisements, one featuring the president leading the masses and carrying a banner saying, “Mexico united, never defeated!”\n\nAnd Ms. Sheinbaum, who has been trying to balance a pro-Mexico drumbeat while advocating cooperative dialogue with American officials, has seen her approval ratings rise as high as 80 percent, according to one poll. She has not only succeeded a popular president, Andres Manuel López Obrador, who reshaped Mexican politics and was her mentor, but has come into her own at a time of global upheaval under Mr. Trump.\n\n“There’s a lot of support for the president now,” said Juan Manuel Sánchez, 57, an artisan in Mexico City who also praised Ms. Sheinbaum’s crackdown on drug trafficking.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump used tariffs to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and strike a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, which he signed in 2020. He has used similar tactics now against Mexico and Canada, while arguing that too many illegal drugs and migrants are flowing from the two countries into the United States.\n\nA month ago, Mr. Trump signed an executive order calling for 25 percent tariffs on Mexican imports. But less than a day before they were to go into effect, Mr. Trump and Ms. Sheinbaum spoke on the phone and announced an agreement to delay them for 30 days.\n\nUnder the terms of that deal, Mexico posted an additional 10,000 Mexican National Guard troops on the border to help stem the flow of fentanyl and migrants into the United States. In return, Ms. Sheinbaum said, the U.S. government would work to stop the flow of guns into Mexico.\n\nImage A Mexican National Guard member at a tent used to hold repatriated Mexican citizens in Ciudad Juárez, near the U.S. border, in January. Credit... Paul Ratje for The New York Times\n\nEven though the number of migrant crossings at the southern border has dropped to once unthinkable levels since Mr. Trump took office in January, Mexican officials were significantly deterring migration to the United States months before. Last week, Mexico sent nearly 30 top cartel operatives wanted by American authorities to the United States, one of the largest such handovers in the history of the drug war.\n\n“There’s a lot of unity in the country in the face of what is happening,” including Mr. Trump’s economic threats, Ms. Sheinbaum said on Monday, hours before the tariffs took effect.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump insisted on Monday that the tariffs would begin the next day, the cloud over Mexico from the north has loomed since his most recent presidential campaign. It led to uncertainty and frustration but also boosted national pride.\n\nAgustin Barrios Gómez, a former Mexican congressman and a founding member of the nonprofit Mexican Council on Foreign Relations, said that even Mexicans who didn’t vote for Ms. Sheinbaum “understand that right now, Mexico’s national interest — beyond party politics — is to rally around our president.”\n\nOne reason for the surge in support for her, Mr. Barrios Gómez said, was to ensure Ms. Sheinbaum has enough political capital within the country to be in a stronger negotiating position with Mr. Trump come what may.\n\nNationalism is complicated in Mexico, Mr. Barrios Gómez said, because it is so intricately intertwined with the United States geographically, culturally and economically, as well as with immigration and security.\n\n“We are not neighbors, we’re roommates,” he said. In other words, analysts said, the U.S. tariffs against Mexico will hurt both economies, as would the reciprocal tariffs suggested by Ms. Sheinbaum. (Mr. Trump is also threatening separate 25 percent tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports, which would affect Mexico.)\n\nFor Mexico, the tipping point against the United States has not been reached, Mr. Barrios Gómez said late last week before the tariffs went into effect, but “if you call someone your enemy enough, you might just turn them into one.”\n\nThe specter of a trade war between the countries has changed the perception in Mexico of Mr. Trump and of its relationship with the United States.\n\nAccording to the Mexican polling firm Buendía & Marquéz, the number of respondents in Mexico who believed the relationship between Ms. Sheinbaum and Mr. Trump was at least good dropped significantly between last November and February, while the number of respondents who have a negative opinion of Mr. Trump jumped to 80 percent in mid-February from 66 percent in early January.\n\nMr. Trump has nevertheless praised Ms. Sheinbaum as a “marvelous woman” while mocking Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Mr. Trudeau, who has become increasingly unpopular at home, is entering his final days in office while Ms. Sheinbaum’s popular foundation is stronger. She resoundingly won election last summer and began her six-year term in October.\n\nDuring her Monday morning news conference, Ms. Sheinbaum once again called for calm ahead of Mr. Trump’s tariffs deadline and said she hoped to strike a last-minute deal, which did not materialize. “Obviously we don’t want there to be tariffs,” she said, adding that her government would respond.\n\nSince before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, her administration has been promoting what it calls “Plan Mexico,” a strategy meant to diversify its economy to make it less dependent on the United States, to reinvigorate Mexican manufacturing and propel the country to become one of the world’s top 10 economies. (It is currently the 15th largest, according to the International Monetary Fund.)\n\nAs part of that effort, Ms. Sheinbaum’s administration started the “Made in Mexico” drive, in which an official seal is placed on products made in the country that meet certain requirements. The seal, with an illustration of a Mexican eagle, was created in 1978 to promote Mexican goods and has been revived by presidents over the years.\n\nAs the threatened U.S. tariffs were paused a month ago, Mexico’s secretary of economy, Marcelo Ebrard, told companies that the government wanted to once again push the “Made in Mexico” seal.\n\nLast week, Walmart Mexico, the largest private employer in the country with 200,000 workers, unveiled its efforts to put the “Made in Mexico” seal — with the added word “proudly” — in the aisles of its 3,000 stores throughout the country. Although Walmart is an American brand, Javier Treviño, Walmart Mexico’s senior vice president of corporate affairs, said the company wanted to show customers that it is a Mexican entity and that most of the products it sells are made within the nation.\n\nThe campaign “is very important for us because we have to strengthen investment and confidence in Mexico and ensure that the economy can grow, because the environment is not easy,” Mr. Treviño, a former Mexican congressman, said in an interview.\n\nImage In Mexico City, the Grupo Modelo brewery, which manufactures Corona beer, said it would put new “Made in Mexico” caps on its bottles. Credit... Raquel Cunha/Reuters\n\nOther big companies have joined Ms. Sheinbaum’s push, including Grupo Modelo, the brewing giant that makes Corona and Modelo beers, which announced it would put new “Made in Mexico” caps on bottles.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Sánchez, the Mexico City artisan, was at his neighborhood market, which, he said, proved that he prefers to shop locally. Before Mr. Trump’s tariffs went into effect, he said he might consider boycotting U.S. companies and products if they did.\n\nUnlike in Canada, where locals have been shunning American products and buying more Canadian flags since Mr. Trump threatened the tariffs, Mr. Sánchez said that Mexicans were already nationalistic and that most had a flag.\n\n“But when something very serious happens here,” he said, “we all unite.”\n\nMaria Abi-Habib contributed reporting from Mexico City.",

        "content": "President Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China took effect at midnight. By now, you’ve probably heard about the risks: higher prices, slower economic growth, a trade war. Trump acknowledges the potential for economic pain. Yet he signed off on the levies anyway — 25 percent for Canada and Mexico, another 10 percent for China.\n\nWhy? He believes he can’t advance his “America First” agenda without rebalancing trade with other countries. This, he says, will make them do things that are in the United States’ interest. With these latest tariffs, he has demanded that Canada, Mexico and China do more to stop drug trafficking.\n\nBut the tariffs could also harm American interests. If Canada and Mexico decide that America is no longer a reliable partner — one that keeps its word and prizes stability over chaos — they may seek other customers for their goods. They could even turn to U.S. adversaries like China. America would end up more isolated on the world stage.\n\nThis issue isn’t just about trade; it’s about America’s alliances in general. To bend other countries to his will, Trump has suspended military aid to Ukraine, publicly hectored world leaders, threatened to withdraw U.S. troops from Europe and pulled out of international groups like the World Health Organization.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "Access to guns is tightly controlled in Mexico, and it is nearly impossible for civilians to legally obtain the kinds of military-style weapons favored by the cartels. In their legal filings, lawyers for Mexico cited statistics showing that a majority of guns from Mexican crime scenes — between 70 and 90 percent — come from the United States. They also contend that gun dealers in the states that border Mexico sell twice as many weapons as dealers in other parts of the United States.\n\nThe argument before the court is focused on a threshold issue: whether a 2005 federal law prevents such a suit by Mexico against the gun makers. The law, the Protection of Lawful Arms in Commerce Act, was passed after a growing number of lawsuits aimed to hold the gun industry liable in mass shootings in the United States. It prohibits many types of lawsuits against gun manufacturers and sellers — but it allows claims to proceed if plaintiffs can show that their injuries were directly caused by knowing violations of firearms laws.\n\nA federal trial judge in Boston had dismissed Mexico’s lawsuit, finding that it was barred by the 2005 legislation. The judge, F. Dennis Saylor IV, wrote that the law “bars exactly this type of action from being brought in federal and state courts.”\n\nA unanimous three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit disagreed. The appeals court determined that Mexico’s case should be allowed to proceed because its argument that the companies had aided and abetted illegal gun sales in Mexico fit the law’s carve-out for suits.\n\nThe gun makers then asked the Supreme Court to take the case, Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, No. 23-1141.",

        "content": "After the invasion, the United States, Europe and other allies quickly took advantage of their dominance of the global financial system and froze Russian assets held by their financial institutions. Later, the industrialized democracies that make up the Group of 7 pledged to hold on to the funds “until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.”\n\nThe latest estimate to repair that damage is $524 billion over 10 years, according to an update released last week by the World Bank.\n\nWhether to turn over the Kremlin’s money to Ukraine instead of just barring Russia’s access to it, though, has remained contentious. Legal experts and government officials — including some who worked for President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — warned that confiscating the money could violate international law and undermine confidence in Western financial institutions. And there was concern that American and European assets held in other countries might be more at risk in the future if a dispute arose.\n\nFrance, Belgium and Germany have resisted the idea in the past.\n\nWhen President Emmanuel Macron of France visited the White House last month, he reiterated that Russia’s assets “are not our belongings, so they are frozen.” And Belgium, which is holding the biggest single chunk of Russian money, for instance, is worried about the potentially damaging legal and financial fallout of transferring the funds to Ukraine.",

        "content": "The decision to suspend aid came out of meetings at the White House on Monday between Mr. Trump and his senior national security aides, according to senior administration and military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. It appears aimed at forcing Mr. Zelensky to agree to a cease-fire on terms Mr. Trump dictates, or condemns the country to larger battlefield losses.\n\nThe officials said the directive would be in effect until Mr. Trump determined that Ukraine had demonstrated a good-faith commitment to peace negotiations with Russia. It was not immediately clear what that might look like or how long the suspension will last. For now, it will be up to Kyiv and its European allies to try to keep Ukraine’s guns firing.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nMr. Trump’s move has few direct precedents in recent American history. The United States has paused the transfer of specific weapons systems to allies and partners, like when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. suspended deliveries of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel that he feared could be used against civilians in Gaza. But a full cutoff is unusual, and is essentially an ultimatum.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "The Senate voted along party lines on Monday to confirm Linda McMahon as the nation’s next education secretary, putting the former pro-wrestling executive in charge of an agency that the Trump administration wants to eliminate.\n\nA wealthy Republican donor who served in the first Trump administration, Ms. McMahon has little experience in education. That lack of firsthand knowledge has been framed as an asset by a White House looking to abolish the department she now leads and as a glaring deficiency by her critics.\n\nMs. McMahon, 76, told lawmakers during her confirmation process that she “wholeheartedly” agreed with President Trump’s “mission” to eliminate the Education Department. During her hearing last month, she argued that most Americans did, too, and that she was ready to make it happen.\n\nBut there appears to be significant public opposition to getting rid of the department.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans said last week that they opposed eliminating the agency, according to the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll. In North Carolina, one of seven battleground states that Mr. Trump swept in November, a similar share, 63 percent, also said they opposed abolishing the agency, according to a Meredith College poll last month.\n\nThe Education Department has already been a top target of the aggressive government overhaul project overseen by Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a key Trump adviser. At least 60 employees have been suspended as part of the administration’s purge of diversity efforts, and Mr. Musk’s team has discussed the possibility of an executive order that would effectively shut down the department.\n\nOn Friday, employees in the department were given a “one-time offer” of up to $25,000 if they agreed to retire or resign by the end of the day on Monday. The message, sent by Jacqueline Clay, the department’s chief human capital officer, said the offer was being made before “a very significant reduction in force.”\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats and is their top representative on the Senate Education Committee, said the department provides “enormously important resources” to children in high-poverty school districts and those with disabilities.\n\n“We must make the Department of Education stronger and more efficient, not to dismantle it as Trump has proposed,” Mr. Sanders said in a statement.\n\nAmong the first 20 Trump nominations confirmed by the Senate, Ms. McMahon is the sixth whom Democrats unanimously opposed. The others were Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense; Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health; Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director; and Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce.\n\nThe Education Department’s primary role has been sending federal money to public schools, administering college financial aid and managing federal student loans. The department tracks student achievement, but does not dictate what is taught in public schools. With about 4,200 employees as of September, the agency’s work force was the smallest of the 15 cabinet-level executive departments.\n\nMs. McMahon has said she would push for more local control of education programs and to “free American students from the education bureaucracy” by pushing for school choice programs.\n\nSenator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chairman of the Education Committee, said Ms. McMahon would help streamline the department.\n\n“We need a strong leader at the department who will get our education system back on track,” Mr. Cassidy said after the confirmation vote. “Secretary McMahon is the right person for the job.”\n\nMs. McMahon received a teaching certificate, but she never taught. She has been a member of the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University, a private school in Connecticut with about 8,500 students, for about 16 years. She and her husband, Vince McMahon, from whom she is separated, have donated millions to the Catholic university, where the student commons bears her name.\n\nShe also served for about a year on the Connecticut State Board of Education, even though some state lawmakers questioned her experience for the position and said she ran a wrestling company that promoted violent and sexual images to children.\n\nHer nomination to run the Education Department prompted a new round of concerns about her experience, as critics have said she is ill-prepared to navigate the effects that Mr. Trump’s politically charged agenda may have on the nation’s schools.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters last month that the Education Department was “a big con job” and that “I’d like to close it immediately.” Mr. Musk has said the administration terminated 89 contracts worth $881 million at the agency.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, Ms. McMahon presented a more nuanced version of potential changes. She said the administration planned to “reorient” the department while acknowledging that some of the agency’s largest programs would remain in place. She also said core programs, such as Title I money for low-income schools and Pell grants for the poorest college students, would not be eliminated.\n\nShe also agreed that an act of Congress would be required to abolish the department, which was created in 1979 to ensure equal access to education, help parents and local communities improve the quality of education and coordinate federal education programs.\n\nA more likely target for cuts was federal money to schools and colleges that defy Mr. Trump’s orders seeking to bar transgender women from competing in women’s sports, and doing away with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nResponding to a question at the hearing last week from Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, Ms. McMahon said schools should allow events celebrating the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but was more circumspect about classes that focused on Black history.\n\n“I’m not quite certain and I’d like to look into it further,” Ms. McMahon said.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, Ms. McMahon served as the head of the Small Business Administration until stepping down in 2019 to run a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump. That super PAC, America First Action, spent more than $185 million ahead of Mr. Trump’s loss in 2020.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, Ms. McMahon was among the largest contributors to Mr. Trump's campaign. She and her husband contributed more than $20 million to Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign and associated PACs, according to data compiled by Open Secrets, a government transparency group.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was voted out of office in 2020, Ms. McMahon became chairwoman of the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank heavily staffed by former Trump officials. She has also taken on roles with other conservative policy organizations and The Daily Caller, a conservative news site.\n\nShe is paid $18,400 every three months by the Trump Media & Technology Group, where she is a director. and has received thousands of shares in the company as compensation for her work. The group is the parent company of Mr. Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nMs. McMahon has vowed to resign from those positions and divest from Mr. Trump’s business.",

We know that when our people unite around their history, their country and their flag, there is no force in the world that can break their spirit.”\n\nTimes had changed, she said: Mexico would not bow down to foreign governments.\n\nGiven the circumstances — President Trump’s steep tariffs against Mexico went into effect in the first minutes of Tuesday — Ms. Sheinbaum’s optics were fitting. As Mr. Trump once again targeted Mexico, using the hammer of tariffs as a negotiating tool, a sense of Mexican nationalism has been strengthened.\n\nThe Mexican government and businesses have rekindled a “Made in Mexico” campaign. Some Mexicans have called for boycotts of U.S. companies and products, while others have put together lists of Mexican stores and brands to support instead of American ones.",

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump will have the opportunity to explain the decision and address what the United States’ support for the war-torn country will look in the future.\n\nThe president is no fan of Mr. Zelensky and has made clear he wants a drastically different approach from the Biden administration, which sent billions of dollars in aid and weapons to counter Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago.\n\nMr. Trump has been pressing Ukraine to agree to a cease-fire with Russia on terms the United States negotiates. Mr. Zelensky has balked because those discussions have not included the Ukrainians or American security guarantees to prevent future Russian incursions. The outburst in the Oval Office started in part because Mr. Zelensky reminded Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance that Russia has broken cease-fires with Ukraine before.\n\n“I just think he should be more appreciative,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Zelensky on Monday.\n\nMr. Trump has said he wants to position himself as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, and in doing so he has softened the United States’ posture toward Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. But after Mr. Zelensky left Washington without signing a deal for the United States to have access to Ukraine’s revenue for rare earth minerals, the next steps to ending the war remained unclear.\n\nWhat does Trump say about Elon Musk and his team?\n\nMr. Musk, who is expected to be in attendance on Tuesday, has had a singular influence in the Trump administration. He has overseen the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to reduce government spending, a process that has sown confusion as it cuts jobs and funding across the federal bureaucracy and that has led to a number of lawsuits.",

        "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

        "content": "How Americans Feel About Tariffs Trump loves tariffs. Do Americans?\n\nIt depends how pollsters ask the question.\n\n25% of respondents in favor of tariffs 35 45 55 In these two polls, just 29% expressed support for tariffs ... ... while in another poll, 56% did 30% of respondents in favor of tariffs 40 50 In these two polls, just 29% expressed support for tariffs ... ... while in another poll, 56% did\n\nAmericans express very different views on tariffs depending upon how the question is asked, a challenge for pollsters trying to measure public support for a complex and poorly understood issue.\n\nShare of Americans in favor of tariffs 25% 50% Support for tariffs can be as high as 56% ... Average: 41% ... or as low as 29% 25% 50% Support for tariffs can be as high as 56% ... Average: 41% ... or as low as 29% Share of Americans in favor of tariffs 25% 50% Generic question about tariffs: 48% Question that mentions taxes: 43% 25% 50% Generic question about tariffs Question that mentions taxes Share of Americans in favor of tariffs 25% 50% Poll mentions China Mentions other places Canada, Mexico, Europe 25% 50% Poll mentions China Mentions other places Canada, Mexico, Europe Share of Americans in favor of tariffs 25% 50% “ ... to bring back American jobs”: 49% “ ... even if prices increase”: 30% 25% 50% “ ... to bring back American jobs”: 49% “ ... even if prices increase”: 30% A series of bar charts showing the share of Americans who expressed support for tariffs in polls conducted this year. The percentage ranges from 29 percent to 56 percent. Each bar in this chart represents a poll finding about how many Americans support tariffs, from a sampling of this year’s surveys. When a survey question defines tariffs as taxes on imports, for example, fewer people say they support them. When a survey question calls out specific countries, more are in favor of tariffs on China than on other countries. Citing the potential upsides or downsides of tariffs in the question can also dramatically alter support.\n\nHow you define a complicated subject can sway the results.\n\nTariffs are a wonky subject, the details of which are unfamiliar to many, maybe even most, Americans. As evidence: In the days after Mr. Trump took office, there were more Google searches for “tariffs” than searches for “Taylor Swift.”\n\nSome pollsters try to increase comprehension by describing tariffs in the question wording, typically by defining tariffs as “a tax on imports.” That may not seem controversial — tariffs are a tax on imports, after all — but putting the word “tax” in the question may lead fewer people to say they support them.\n\nThat means the results of the poll may not accurately reflect Americans’ opinions, since some respondents may be making up their minds in real time during the poll. That can be counter to the goal of a poll, which is to measure an existing attitude, not shape a new one.\n\nWhen polls mention potential upsides or parrot Mr. Trump’s talking points about tariffs, more Americans say they are in favor of them. A survey by co/efficient, a right-leaning firm, found that nearly half of Americans approved when asked about “President Trump’s plan to impose tariffs to bring back American jobs and ensure fair international trade.”\n\nThe inverse is true when respondents are prompted with the downsides. A YouGov survey from late January asked respondents who had said that tariffs should be increased whether they would support increasing them “even if that leads to higher prices for American consumers.” Nearly half of those who previously had said they supported increasing tariffs said that they either wouldn’t support increasing tariffs or were not sure.\n\nEven those who favor tariffs feel they could be harmful.\n\nWhen asked if they think tariffs will help or hurt the economy, Americans are more likely to say they expect tariffs to hurt the economy. This finding is consistent across multiple surveys.\n\nThis is true even of Americans who support tariffs. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 37 percent of those who support tariffs said they thought tariffs would be good for them personally. Nearly a third said tariffs would not help them personally, even though they supported the measures; another 33 percent were not sure.\n\nIncluding an “unsure” option dramatically alters support.\n\nSometimes public opinion on an issue can be relatively stable. On the issue of abortion, for example, attitudes are generally unchanged by small differences in question wording. About 60 percent of Americans support abortion being at least mostly legal, for example, and the results don’t differ much between different ways of asking.\n\nBut on more complex issues, like tariffs, public opinion is not as settled. As a result, small differences in how the question is asked can lead to large differences in the results.\n\nIn addition, when polls allow people to say they are “unsure,” fewer respondents will express a position on tariffs. This is true any time pollsters offer respondents an explicit option to say they are unsure, but it is particularly pronounced on sensitive or complex questions.\n\nMost polls reviewed by The Times offered only two answers — variations on favor or oppose — or the option to skip the question entirely (which only a small percentage did).\n\nDo you favor or oppose tariffs? Each bar represents a survey finding Favor Oppose 50% Did not respond Favor Oppose 50% Did not respond\n\nA few surveys, however, explicitly gave respondents the option to answer with “unsure” or “neither favor nor oppose.” On average, over a quarter of respondents chose that option — yet another factor that lowers support.\n\nIncluding “unsure” or “neither” as an option lowers both support and opposition. Favor Oppose 50% Including “unsure” or “neither” as an option lowers both support and opposition. Favor Oppose 50%\n\nThere are also a number of elements beyond the question wording that make measuring support for tariffs difficult. As Mr. Trump continues to change his plans for tariffs, it is hard for the public to keep up. So depending on when the questions were asked, the public may have a fundamentally different understanding of what is happening.\n\nHow the survey was conducted can also come into play. Some surveys are of all Americans, while some are just of registered voters, two groups that have slightly different political leanings. And surveys taken over the phone with an interviewer compared with surveys taken on the web may also yield slightly different results.\n\nPublic opinion may become clearer over time, as policy becomes more settled and people begin to see real-world impact. But for the time being, tariffs are an issue on which true public opinion is difficult to truly know.",

In pursuing his agenda, Mr. Trump has repeatedly made false statements and claims lacking evidence, including that Ukraine started the war with Russia and that diversity programs at the Federal Aviation Administration led to a plane crash this year.\n\nThe president’s address is expected to touch on the major cuts that he and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have ordered for federal programs and the government’s work force. He is also expected to trumpet his immigration crackdown and his moves to impose steep tariffs in an effort to bolster domestic manufacturing.\n\nMr. Trump’s remarks on these issues over the past few weeks offer a preview of possible talking points. Here’s a fact-check:\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“We were richest — the richest, relatively — from, think of this, from 1870 to 1913. That was our richest because we collected tariffs from foreign countries that came in and took our jobs and took our money, took our everything, but they charged tariffs.”\n\n— at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22",

The agency brought her to the Otay Mesa detention center, where she’s now been for more than a month.\n\nAccording to KPBS, US Customs and Border Protection accused Brösche of planning to violate the terms of the visa waiver program by intending to work as a tattoo artist during her time in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to ABC’s 10News, she was forced to spend eight days in solitary confinement in the facility.\n\n“She says it was like a horror movie. They were screaming in all different rooms. After nine days, she said she went so insane that she started punching the walls and then she’s got blood on her knuckles,” Lofving said of her friend’s experience.\n\nLofving said she asked Ice agents if Brösche could be sent back to Mexico, but they responded that her lack of legal residency would mean she would be deported back to Germany. Lofving also said she tried to get help from the German consulate in Los Angeles.\n\nLofving initially had no idea where Brösche was being held or if she had already been deported to Germany. It was only after pleading for help online and using the federal Detainee Locator website that she was able to track down her friend.\n\nIt would be 25 days before Lofving would find and be allowed to visit her friend at the detention center, where she remains.",

        "content": "Are peonies a life philosophy? Are “life philosophies” even philosophy? I have to hold on to the idea that they aren’t, even in the face of a decade or so of Instagram blitzkrieg, most currently in the form of Duchess Meghan’s eight-part new TV show, which dropped on Netflix first thing this morning. With Love, Meghan seems to have migrated fully formed from Mark Zuckerberg’s social media platform on to Ted Sarandos’s streaming service, powered by the hashtags that bypass the need for joined-up sentences, let alone thinking. Or as Her Grace explains: “Everyone’s invited to create wonder in every moment.” This is an offer not even promised by most major religions.\n\nThe mildest way to describe this show is as a ghastly artefact of a particular cultural era that recently met its apocalypse. But more on that later. To anyone who says, “It’s just meant to be fun”: bullshit. Netflix reportedly paid $100m (£78m) to Prince Harry and the manic pixie dream duchess for an overall deal, so for the streamer it’s meant to make back at least a small amount of the big amount of money they’ve lost, when audiences failed to connect with the Sussex-authored documentaries about global justice activists and polo. For Meghan, it’s supposed to assist her transformation into domestic guru. If you don’t mind arching an eyebrow at the lifestyle lunacies of fellow Montecito resident Gwyneth Paltrow, then at least have some consistency and give yourself a pass on this one. This show is sensationally absurd and trite, and if you watch it, you know it.\n\nLanguage is either category-five twee or has been reduced to non-sentient babyspeak. “Good vibes, good hives”. “Clean clean clean clean.” “Single skillet spaghetti. S-s-s. S-s-s …” I won’t labour the 1% of the 1% mood, though someone driving through one of America’s most rarefied billionaires’ communities to buy a few hundred dollars’ worth of flowers while telling you, “It’s the little things that count” is obviously ridiculous. As is referring to a bucket as a “garbage vessel”. Nor will I, “as a woman”, do more than note that you don’t see successful men spending for ever on all this stuff. Zuckerberg and Sarandos presumably decided a very long time ago that part of the goal is to not even know where your kitchen is.\n\nView image in fullscreen A still from With Love, Meghan. Photograph: Jenna Peffley/Netflix\n\nOf much more interest is how these Insta-perfect worlds have grabbed people by the throat and siphoned away so much of their valuable time and attention in recent years. Scrolling the platform or watching Meghan’s show (they are almost identical sensory experiences), you note how much of the language is explicitly religious. Time is described as “sacred”, practices are “rituals”, people are continually feeling “blessed”, snacks are “an offering”, the emphasis is on “honouring” this or that. It becomes hard not to see all the flower frogs and rosemary sprigs and garbage vessels as holy kit, arranged in esoteric fashion as if to summon a form of peace. Or rather, #peace. But peace through retail, always – even if the product turns out to be you.\n\nIt’s amusing to learn from publicists and Meghan herself that the duchess’s artisan this-and-thats will be available in the Netflix brick-and-mortar stores opening this year. Other eras have had their epicureans or hedonists, of course, who lived and sometimes died for the ideal of simplicity or pleasure in an epic kind of way. But today’s gazillion-strong influencer community has zero intellectual underpinning to it, which is why it’s so often the unwitting butt of its own joke. I’m trying to picture Oscar Wilde being told Netflix is going to sell limited edition artisan Oscar Wilde buttonholes in its shop, and him just fainting at the obvious horror of it all.\n\nSorry to press an unmodernised yet perfectly adequate word into action, but of course all this stuff is perfectly nice. It’s nice if the table is laid nicely, it’s lovely if the flowers are lovely, it’s caring of you to make people feel cared for, whatever that really means. (I wonder if the truly selfless tablescape actually exists – Meghan’s entire MO feels desperately “compliments to the hostess”.) As I say, it’s all nice. But it’s neither a long nor an interesting conversation – at best it should serve as a backdrop to one. And yet over the past rise-of-the-influencer decade, it seems to have become the conversation.\n\nDecades often seem to be about certain things, before another, defining thing sneaks in under the radar. The 2000s seemed to be about celebrity culture and Islamist fundamentalism, but in retrospect the 2008 financial crash – both its causes and the failure to deliver justice in its aftermath – was the key event. The 10 years we have just lived through might have seemed to be about social media and what came to be summarised as woke culture. But a global fracturing was stealing under the radar.\n\nIt certainly isn’t any more. In fact, watching With Love, Meghan early this morning already felt like a past washing over me, so much so that I decided that maybe – and please stay with me for this hot take – maybe, Meghan has made a landmark TV series after all. Immerse yourself in it for an episode or eight, and you instinctively feel that both the show and the duchess embody the age that has become suddenly bygone. And that is the exact feeling that countless people have been experiencing since this year turned – that an era is dying. Or rather, that it has already died, and suddenly. There were many others, but Meghan was as good an avatar for it as any – torn between wildly ineffective social justice activism, and the narcotising retreat of the peonied table. But this is now over, and I think we can all feel it in our bones. Rest in peace/power/whatever. But godspeed to something else – something better – being born.",

        "content": "The Trump administration has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments, as the White House piles pressure on Kyiv to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe decision affects deliveries of ammunition, vehicles and other equipment, including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president.\n\nIt comes after a dramatic blow-up in the White House on Friday during which Donald Trump, infuriated over what he claimed was the Ukrainian leader’s disrespect and ingratitude, told Volodymyr Zelenskyy he was “gambling with” a third world war. Zelenskyy was told to come back “when he is ready for peace”.\n\nUkraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said on Tuesday that Kyiv still had the means to supply its frontline forces but warned thousands of lives were at risk and vital US-provided air defence systems could be affected.\n\n“We will continue to work with the US through all available channels in a calm manner,” Shmyhal told a press conference. “We only have one plan – to win and to survive.”\n\nMoscow celebrated the decision, with the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying the US had been “the main supplier of this war so far”.\n\nEuropean and Nato allies were not informed in advance, a Polish foreign ministry spokesperson said.\n\n“This is a very important decision, and the situation is very serious,” Paweł Wroński told reporters. “This sentence may sound banal, but it has great political significance – it [the decision] was made without any information, or consultation, neither with Nato allies, nor with the Ramstein group,” he said. The Ramstein group is an alliance of 57 countries that has coordinated aid to Ukraine during the war.\n\nGovernments in Europe, fearful of an emboldened Russia during a US administration that resents a cold war-era pact to support its allies against aggression, have rushed to boost their own military spending.\n\nThe European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced proposals on Tuesday to strengthen Europe’s defence industry and increase military capabilities by mobilising close to €800bn (£661bn). The EU is holding an emergency summit on Thursday.\n\nThe White House’s decision followed a meeting that included Hegseth and the vice-president, JD Vance, along with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; and Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.\n\nOleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said Trump appeared to be pushing Ukraine towards capitulation. “To stop aid now means to help Putin,” Merezhko told Reuters. “On the surface, this looks really bad. It looks like he is pushing us towards capitulation, meaning [accepting] Russia’s demands.”\n\nRazom for Ukraine, a Ukrainian advocacy group, said: “By abruptly halting military assistance to Ukraine, President Trump is hanging Ukrainians out to dry and giving Russia the green light to continue marching west. Razom for Ukraine urges the White House to immediately reverse course, resume military aid and pressure Putin to end his horrific invasion.”\n\nThe US Congress has approved $175bn (£138bn) in total assistance for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion nearly three years ago, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In December, shortly before leaving office, Biden announced an additional $5.9bn in security and budget assistance.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The majority – well over $20bn, according to a Reuters analysis – has been shipped.\n\nThe announcement pertains mainly to aid that had been previously approved but not yet disbursed. Trump has not approved any new aid under his own presidential authority since taking office and a new congressional aid package appears unlikely, at least in the near term.\n\n​US Democrats said the aid pause was dangerous. Brendan Boyle​, a congressman in Pennsylvania who is a co-chair of the congressional EU caucus, ​said it was ​“reckless, indefensible and a direct threat to our national security”​.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump had expressed fresh outrage at Zelenskyy for saying the end of the war could be “very, very far away”.\n\nTrump posted a link to an Associated Press story outlining Zelenskyy’s comments and said: “This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\n\n“It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US. Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?”\n\nLater on Monday, Trump said Zelenskyy “won’t be around very long” unless he succumbed to pressure and made a deal on US terms.\n\nThe Trump administration was also reported to be drawing up a plan on Monday to restore ties with Russia and lift sanctions on the Kremlin.\n\nThe White House has asked the state and treasury departments to draft a list of sanctions that could be eased for US officials to discuss with Russian representatives in the coming days as part of the administration’s broad talks with Moscow on improving diplomatic and economic relations, Reuters reported, citing a US official and another person familiar with the matter.\n\n1:02 'Some random country': Vance appears to insult UK and France with Ukrainian taunt – video\n\nIn an interview recorded on Monday before the announcement of the suspension, Vance told the Fox News channel’s Hannity that giving the US an economic interest in the future of Ukraine would serve as a security guarantee – a reference to the minerals deal about which Zelenskyy had been summoned to Washington.\n\n“If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,” Vance said.\n\nReuters contributed to this report",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "China and Canada have announced retaliatory measures against the US after Donald Trump imposed his sweeping tariffs plan, despite warnings it could spark an escalating trade war.\n\nUS tariffs of 25% have come into force against goods from Canada and Mexico, the US’s two biggest trading partners, and 20% tariffs against Chinese goods – doubling the levy on China from last month.\n\nThe duties will affect more than $918bn (£722bn) worth of US imports from Canada and Mexico.\n\nChina said on Tuesday it would impose fresh tariffs on a range of agricultural imports from the US next week.\n\nIts finance ministry said additional 15% tariffs would be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton, with further 10% tariffs on sorghum, soya beans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. It has also raised additional complaints against the US with the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on C$30bn (£16.3bn) worth of US imports. He said previously that Canada would target US beer, wine, bourbon, home appliances and Florida orange juice.\n\nTariffs will be placed on another C$125bn (£68bn) of US goods if Trump’s tariffs are still in place in 21 days. “Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,” Trudeau said, adding that they would violate the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement signed by Trump during his first term.\n\nMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said on Tuesday that there was no justification for Trump’s tariffs and said her government would respond with tariff and non-tariff measures.\n\nAsian markets were down – after sharp falls in US markets on Monday – as Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2%, Taiwan’s benchmark TWII index was off 0.5% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.3%.\n\nThe Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell to their lowest levels in a month on Tuesday. The US dollar index, which tracks the currency against six peers, fell to a three-month low, down 0.75%.\n\nIn Europe, the FTSE 100 dropped by 81 points, or 0.8%, a day after rising to more than 8,900 points for the first time. Germany’s Dax and Spain’s Ibex indices fell more than 2%, while France’s Cac 40 was off almost 2%.\n\nTrump and his allies claim that higher tariffs on US imports from across the world will help “make America great again” by enabling it to obtain political and economic concessions from allies and rivals on the global stage.\n\nBusinesses, inside the US and worldwide, have warned of widespread disruption if the Trump administration pushes ahead with this strategy.\n\nSince winning November’s presidential election, Trump has focused on China, Canada and Mexico, threatening the three markets with steep duties on their exports unless they reduced the “unacceptable” levels of illegal drugs crossing into the US.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has pledged to bring down prices in the US, but economists have warned that consumers in the country could be adversely affected by his trade plans.\n\nA 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico and a 10% levy on China amounts to “the largest tax increase in at least a generation”, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a thinktank that estimated the move would cost the typical US household more than $1,200 each year.\n\nTrump has vowed to go further, threatening to introduce “reciprocal” tariffs on countries that have their own duties on goods made in the US. He has said these will come into effect as soon as next month.\n\nThe US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, claimed that Chinese manufacturers would swallow the US tariffs. He said on Tuesday: “China’s business model is export, export, export, and that’s unacceptable. I am highly confident that the Chinese manufacturers will eat the tariffs; prices won’t go up.”\n\nTrump has said the tariffs on China are because the government has failed to stop illicit fentanyl entering the US, which Beijing says is a “pretext” to threaten China.\n\n“China opposes this move and will do what is necessary to firmly safeguard its legitimate interests,” a foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said. “If the United States … persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end.”\n\nChina’s finance ministry said: “The US’s unilateral tariff increase damages the multilateral trading system, increases the burden on US companies and consumers, and undermines the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”\n\nThe ministry said products shipped from the US to China that departed before 10 March and arrived before 12 April would not be subject to the tariffs.",

        "title": "How do I stay healthy in my 70s?",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Today’s septuagenarians are different from the ones who came before. “Many transitions that are happening now at 70 are the types of transitions people in previous generations might have experienced in their early 60s,” says Jeffrey Stokes, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston who studies ageing.\n\nPeople in this group are becoming grandparents and retiring later, Stokes explains. They can also expect to live longer.\n\n“Seventy is a great time for somebody to try something new,” Stokes says. “There can be a lot of unseen benefits.”\n\nWe spoke with experts about health in the 70s and how to achieve those benefits.\n\nWhat are normal signs of ageing in your 70s?\n\nDr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, explains that certain medical conditions and functional problems – challenges like decreased mobility and impaired balance – become more common as people age. However, he also notes, there can be wide variability regarding health and appearance among people of the same age.\n\n“You can see 70-year-olds who look like they are 50 and 70-year-olds who look like they’re 90,” says Lachs. “It’s very individualized.”\n\nGenetics, lifestyle choices and the conditions in which a person lives can affect how they age. It’s also possible for your chronological age – how many years you’ve been alive – to differ from your biological age – how old your body appears – based on biomarkers and how well your body is functioning. Even your organs can age at different rates.\n\nHow does the body change in your 70s?\n\nWhile there is no “normal” way to age, certain health challenges can be more common during your 70s. By age 75, people typically receive, on average, between two to three medical diagnoses, explains Lachs; these might include arthritis, hypertension and hearing loss.\n\nLachs says that people in their 70s can remain independent and generally healthy, depending on factors such as economic background, genetics, psychosocial environment and motivation to commit to good habits.\n\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The Guardian\n\nThe likelihood of hearing loss increases with age, says Lachs, though to what extent depends on the individual. About one in three people between 65 and 74 and nearly half of people older than 75 have hearing loss.\n\nIt’s also possible that your reaction time may slow down, says Lachs, but not to a concerning extent.\n\nSeventy is a great time for somebody to try something new Jeffrey Stokes, University of Massachusetts Boston\n\nPeople in their 70s might also experience sleep issues. Research suggests sleep quality decreases as age increases; one study found adults older than 60 had a 70% loss of deep sleep compared with people between 18 and 25.\n\nHowever, compared with other decades, the 70s can be a pretty stable time for health, says Dr Deborah Kado, a professor of medicine and co-director of the Stanford Longevity Center. This is especially true for women, the majority of whom already experienced swings of change when they went through menopause. There will always be unforeseeable health hurdles, but these can happen at any age; what’s key, she says, is committing to healthy behaviors before you turn 70 and sticking with them after.\n\nWhich health tests should you get regularly in your 70s?\n\nMany health screenings recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK for older adults are framed as guidance for adults aged 65 and older. The free NHS health check concludes at age 74. In part, this lack of guidance explicitly aimed at older ages is due to limited research on the effectiveness of these tests, says Kado. A Harvard Medical School article on screening after age 75 also observes that it can be difficult to provide general recommendations because individual needs at this stage can vary.\n\nScreenings become more complicated as we age, and knowing when to stop screening can be challenging, Lachs explains. If you have a family history of a disease, it can be helpful to speak with your doctor about what’s right for you and discuss the costs and benefits. For some, a screening could lead to preventative care that increases quality of life. For others, incidental findings may primarily cause anxiety and lead to invasive, minimally helpful procedures.\n\nOne screening Lachs does recommend for people in their 70s is a bone mineral density test, which measures bone strength and thickness. This test is a tool for early intervention in osteoporosis, which becomes more common as people age. While men typically lose bone density more slowly than women, both groups lose bone mass at about the same rate by age 65 to 70.\n\nHe also supports screening for functional limitations, which often involve physical performance tests. If, for example, a screening like this suggests a person is at risk for falling, Lachs can recommend that they work with a physical therapist to decrease that risk.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a volunteer group of national experts, does recommend men and women be screened for colorectal cancer regularly from age 65 to 75 and for lung cancer between 50 and 80. The USPSTF also observes that mammograms “work best” at finding cancer in women aged 40 to 74, and it’s not clear how helpful these tests are for women 75 and older.\n\nThe NHS offers bowel cancer screenings for everyone aged 54 to 74. It​​ also provides lung cancer screenings to people who have smoked between the ages of 55 and 74. The NHS also invites women aged 50 to 71 to have a breast cancer screening – though women over 71 can still make appointments to screen.\n\nWhich vaccines should you get in your 70s?\n\nLachs strongly recommends people stay up to date with their vaccines. He speaks with his patients about the increased importance of vaccinating as an older person; unvaccinated older adults are at a greater risk of experiencing severe illness; as we get older, it’s harder for the immune system to fight off infections.\n\nSeveral vaccines are recommended for older adults, though it’s important to speak with your care provider about what is right for you. In the US, the NIH recommends getting vaccinated for Covid-19, flu, pneumonia and shingles, and getting the Tdap; the latter is the vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and all adults are advised to get one dose and then a booster every 10 years. The CDC recommends RSV vaccines for adults 75 and older, as well as for 60- to 74-year-olds at an increased risk for severe RSV.\n\nIn England, the NHS recommends people over 65 be vaccinated for flu, shingles and pneumonia, and those between 75 and 79 for RSV.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Well Actually Free weekly newsletter Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, any type of cardiovascular exercise at modest levels will do, including actions like dancing, walking and climbing the stairs. He’s especially a fan of yoga because it helps with balance and flexibility while providing a social outlet.\n\nPositive, enriching relationships also strengthen physical and cognitive health, which promotes longevity, says Stokes.\n\nThere’s no drug better than a good night’s sleep Dr Mark Lachs, Weill Cornell Medicine\n\nAs people hit 70, they tend to put less effort into casual relationships and invest more into their already closest and most rewarding connections, he explains. Often retired, they focus more on their marriages, kids and grandkids. Being a grandparent who helps out can be especially rewarding because research suggests strong relationships that provide a sense of purpose are even likelier to imbue health benefits, Stokes explains.\n\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The Guardian\n\nBut while people in their 70s are good at focusing on their most rewarding relationships and repairing the benefits, they’re less skilled at creating and fostering new relationships, Stokes says. Targeting this area “can go a long way in reducing some of the loneliness and isolation” that can affect people’s oldest years, he explains. Close ties are great, but it can be even better to have a rich and diverse social network that can support you – especially because bereavement can become more common as we get older.\n\nLifespan can also be improved through diet – less meat and more plants, advises Lachs. A 2025 study found a combination of consuming foods or supplements rich in omega-3 oils and vitamin D, combined with exercise, is a recipe for slowing biological ageing.\n\nSleep is important, too. The National Institute on Ageing (NIA) and the NHS recommend that older adults get seven to nine hours each night.\n\n“There’s no drug I could prescribe that is better than a good night’s sleep,” Lachs says.\n\nIs it too late to get fit after 70?\n\nStudies suggest that by adopting healthy lifestyle choices, you can “reverse a lot of damage and physiologically even appear younger than you did before you implemented those changes”, says Kado.\n\n“This is true for your 70s and beyond,” she says. “You can be in a nursing home in your 90s, start high-intensity interval training, and see over 170% increase in your thigh muscle.”\n\nAccording to the NIA, research shows that exercises that support endurance, balance, strength and flexibility help older adults maintain muscle mass and stay healthy and independent for longer. The NIA also emphasizes that almost anyone at any age can exercise and offers recommendations for people with chronic conditions. A 2009 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that adults who started exercising between the ages of 70 and 78 were more likely to live longer and be less lonely than adults of the same age who did not.\n\nBut the reverse is also true. If people don’t engage in behaviors like exercising, their health will likely decline, Kado says. Some studies suggest that about 30% of adults over 70 have trouble with walking, climbing stairs and getting out of a chair. These results can be mitigated by exercise.\n\n“If you don’t use your muscles, you’re going to lose more muscle and be more likely to lose your mobility,” she says. “This can impact your mood, independence and cognitive ability.”\n\nHow do you stop worrying about getting older?\n\nThoughts about ageing are often plagued by ageism, says Stokes. This viewpoint causes us to hyperfocus on the negative aspects of ageing, and incorrectly predict what getting older will be like.\n\n“There’s an overemphasis on decline,” he says. “People in their 70s often say that they don’t feel old, and the reason for it is that they don’t meet the definition of old we often use.”\n\nFurther, research suggests people with more positive views of ageing are the ones who live longer. Kado describes a more positive view of ageing as a “type of resilience” that helps a person deal with life’s challenges.\n\n“Generally, my older patients who are doing super well beyond their 70s have that resilience factor,” says Kado.\n\nWe can also combat fears of getting older by embracing the positive aspects of ageing, says Stokes. For example, when it comes to mental and emotional health, people in their 70s tend to be happier and more satisfied than people in their 40s and 50s, he explains. The stress of child-rearing and work is likely gone, and they have a greater capacity to enjoy the good and ignore the bad.\n\n“The ultimate irony about ageism is you become the object of your discrimination,” says Lachs. “Find older role models, people in their 80s and 90s, and learn from them.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Unless it becomes a ratings smash (and that isn’t impossible), With Love, Meghan doesn’t just represent the hard launch of Duchess of Sussex’s new career as a Martha Stewart-style lifestyle inspo guru; it might also be the final thing she makes for Netflix.\n\nThe terms of the deal Harry and Meghan signed with the streamer in 2021 were, by all accounts, wildly favourable. Their five-year deal was worth $100m, in the expectation that they would be so brimming with ideas that they would become Obama-style prestige-content producers. Reader, as you already know, this did not happen.\n\nInstead With Love, Meghan is the fourth project to be released under Prince Harry and Meghan’s Archewell banner – and the third consecutive disappointment. Last year’s documentary series Polo – an F1: Drive to Survive rip-off that asked the question “Are polo players as dull as they seem?” then immediately fell asleep – all but died on impact. This was due to a combination of factors, primarily the on-screen absence of Harry and the pointlessness of polo.\n\nPrior to that, there was 2023’s documentary Heart of Invictus, which also had limited appeal. Outside the Netflix deal, there was Meghan’s bizarre podcast cul-de-sac, Archetypes, which ran for 12 episodes in 2022 and was the sum total of the couple’s $20m Spotify deal.\n\nIn truth, With Love, Meghan probably won’t turn things around either, unless the broader public suddenly develops a hankering for long-form television programmes about a woman filling children’s party bags with seeds and manuka honey. This means that the only successful content produced by Harry and Meghan so far has been, well, Harry & Meghan.\n\nThis one you will definitely remember, because it was the reality show that came amid 2022’s post-Megxit Burn It All Down tour, where it felt as if every one of their waking moments was dedicated to lashing out at their families in full view of the public. There was the Oprah interview in which Meghan said that one (and only one) member of the royal family was racist. There was Spare, the book in which Harry detailed all his fights with his brother, plus the time he took so many drugs at Courteney Cox’s house that he ended up having a conversation with a bin.\n\nView image in fullscreen Nobody wants to see these two make decorative ladybird crostini … the Duchess of Sussex with Mindy Kaling in With Love, Meghan. Photograph: Justin Coit/Netflix\n\nBut Harry & Meghan now feels like the pinnacle of all that because, unlike everything else, it understood what audiences expected of them. Yes, it had ambition – parts of the series did a really good job of contextualising the royal family’s history of colonialism – that elevated their complaints from whining. But, more importantly, there was also a lot of whining.\n\nA lot of whining. It was basically all they did for the entire series. And, honestly, they were great at it. Harry & Meghan would have made an amazing 00s VH1 reality show, full of bitchy asides to camera and gratuitous sound effects. There was an unignorable trashiness at its core, an opportunistic desperation for attention that couldn’t be quenched. Had they been smarter about drip-releasing their grievances, rather than unleashing them all at once, Harry & Meghan may well have run for years.\n\nThe thirsty part of Meghan still exists. It’s evident in the Vanity Fair story about her going to a publisher to pitch a book about divorce, despite not actually being divorced yet. And it’s evident in her decision to rebrand herself in With Love, Meghan. The problem is that nobody wants to see Meghan making decorative ladybird crostini with Mindy Kaling. With Love, Meghan is the sort of gormless lifestyle filler that, had it been made by the BBC, would be used to bulk out episodes of Saturday Kitchen.\n\nThere is a version of Meghan that people want to see on screen. But it isn’t the joylessly joy-filled rictus version of With Love, Meghan. No, they want to see the furious, righteous Meghan from Harry & Meghan. In other words, what they want is a proper Meghan reality show.\n\nThere are rumours that Netflix may not cut its losses with the Sussexes completely, instead preferring to keep them on at a vastly reduced rate. This is good news for the content developed but not yet delivered, such as the adaptation of the novel Meet Me at the Lake, and possibly even their aborted animation show, Pearl. But mainly it’s good news for us. If this really is the last roll of the dice, then it may be time for Harry and Meghan to face the inevitable and become the new Osbournes.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Ukraine has reacted with defiance and anger to Donald Trump’s suspension of all US military aid, saying the decision amounted to betrayal by an ally and would help Russia to bomb and kill more civilians.\n\nDeliveries of ammunition and vehicles have ceased, including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president. Ukrainians said the biggest impact was likely to be on Ukraine’s ability to defend itself from Russian air attacks, which have escalated in recent weeks.\n\nUkraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said the White House was trying to “bully” Volodymyr Zelenskyy into accepting a bad peace deal on Moscow’s brutal terms. If Kyiv did not agree, US military aid would be halted permanently, he predicted.\n\n“I think this is extremely wrong on all different levels,” Zagorodnyuk told the Guardian. “Also it will not work with Ukraine. Ukraine will never bend to bullies, and to bullying. It’s as simple as that.”\n\nIn a video address recorded from Kyiv before Monday night’s announcement, Zelenskyy repeated his calls for a “just” settlement of the war. It followed a hostile social media post by Trump claiming that Ukraine’s president did not want peace. “We need peace, true and honest peace – not endless war,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe made clear that any deal had to come with security guarantees – the same position that triggered anger from Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance, when Zelenskyy met them on Friday in the Oval Office.\n\nZelenskyy said security guarantees were “essential”. He pointed out that it was a lack of guarantees that allowed Russia to seize Crimea in 2014 and begin a covert takeover of the Donbas region. Subsequently, it led to Russia’s full-scale 2022 invasion and to its continuing war, he said.\n\nWithout mentioning the US, Zelenskyy added: “The world sees this, and the world acknowledges it. Today, we continued our work with European partners on a special diplomatic and security architecture that can bring us closer to peace.”\n\nUkrainian journalists and commentators noted bitterly that Trump had so far demanded no concessions from Vladimir Putin. The White House’s latest punitive move against Ukraine would lead to “joy in Moscow”, they said.\n\nInstead of acting as a mediator, Trump had sought to squeeze and humiliate Ukraine and force it into territorial concessions that would benefit the Kremlin, they said. Russia says it has “annexed” four Ukrainian regions, including cities it does not control such as Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nThere was a consensus that Trump had already decided to cut US aid before his acrimonious meeting on Friday with Zelenskyy, with the row stirred up deliberately and now used as a pretext. The US was actively aiding Russia, at the expense of Ukraine, it was suggested.\n\n“This isn’t a peace plan, it’s a trap to force our surrender,” Maria Avdeeva, a Ukrainian security expert, posted on BlueSky. She added: “Siding with Russia never helped anyone. Putin isn’t negotiating – he wants our capitulation. Ukraine will remain strong.”\n\nThe philosopher and essayist Volodymyyr Yermolenko acknowledged that the consequences would be extremely painful for ordinary Ukrainians. Even before the shutdown, Ukrainian cities and towns were under massive bombardment from drones and ballistic missiles.\n\n“This war is a slaughter. The Russians are mostly killing defenceless civilians. By halting assistance (primarily air defence), Trump is helping to escalate this slaughter even further,” Yermolenko wrote.\n\nSome observers expressed optimism that Ukraine had been written off before and would prevail against the odds once again. They noted that Putin originally expected to conquer Ukraine within three days back in 2022. Three years later, his troops are still fighting and bogged down in an attritional war.\n\n“We shall endure this as well,” the writer and blogger Ilia Ponomarenko posted.\n\n",

        "content": "President Trump will give an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night in Washington, his first major speech since returning to the White House in January. It’s an opportunity for Trump to lay out his agenda and talk about key policy objectives.\n\nHere’s what to know and how to watch the address.\n\nWhat time is Trump’s address to Congress?\n\nTrump’s address will begin at 9pm ET on 4 March in Washington DC. He will deliver remarks from the chamber of the US House of Representatives.\n\nHow to watch on TV in the US?\n\nMajor news networks are likely to broadcast the address live. PBS will carry a live stream on its YouTube page.\n\nThe Guardian will have a live feed of the address and a team of reporters will be covering and factchecking Trump’s speech.\n\nWhat is Trump likely to talk about?\n\nIn his letter inviting Trump to speak, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, invited the president to share his “America First vision for our legislative future”. The president is expected to lay out his second-term vision after a radical start that has dramatically reshaped both domestic and foreign policy.\n\nIn just a few weeks since being sworn into office, Trump has empowered Elon Musk to dramatically downsize the federal workforce, threatened allies with tariffs and coddled longtime American foes. His administration has initiated sweeping mass layoffs of federal employees, mobilized officers from nearly every federal law enforcement agency and the US military to carry out his campaign promise of mass deportations, and rattled Europe with his pursuit of a peace deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine on terms preferential to Moscow.\n\nIs this a State of the Union?\n\nNo, this is not formally a State of the Union address. However, Trump, like all presidents going back to Ronald Reagan, have given an address to Congress early in their term.\n\nWho will attend?\n\nJohnson will preside over the joint session, alongside Vice-President JD Vance, in his capacity as the president of the Senate.\n\nDemocrats have invited several workers who were fired in Trump’s mass purge of the federal government to attend, in an attempt to embarrass Trump over the unbridled assault on the federal bureaucracy.\n\nChuck Schumer has invited Alissa Ellman, a disabled army veteran who served in Afghanistan and was recently fired from her job at the veterans affairs department in Buffalo.\n\nThe invitations have been extended by some Democrats in lieu of boycotting the event, as some prominent lawmakers are doing.\n\nWho is giving the Democrats’ response?\n\nThe newly-elected Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin will give the Democratic party’s rebuttal to Trump’s address on Tuesday. It’s a high-profile platform for the 48-year-old former CIA analyst, who won a competitive Senate seat in November.\n\nTop Democrat Schumer said she will “offer a bold vision of hope, unity, and a brighter future for everyone, not just the wealthy few at the top”.\n\nIn a social media post, Slotkin said she was “looking forward to speaking directly to the American people next week”.\n\n“The public expects leaders to level with them on what’s actually happening in our country. From our economic security to our national security, we’ve got to chart a way forward that actually improves people’s lives in the country we all love, and I’m looking forward to laying that out,” Slotkin said.\n\nThe rebuttal is an often thankless task, as Katie Britt, Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio, deliverers of previously panned speeches, would attest.",

        "content": "Ukraine’s allies were not told in advance of Donald Trump’s decision to pause military aid, Poland’s foreign ministry has said, as rattled European politicians reaffirmed their backing for Kyiv faced with dramatic further evidence of a US policy shift.\n\nThe US president’s announcement “was made without any information or consultation, neither with Nato allies nor with the Ramstein group which is involved in supporting Ukraine,” the ministry spokesperson Paweł Wroński said on Tuesday.\n\nWroński described the decision, which piles pressure on Kyiv’s remaining allies to step up alternative aid and appears intended to push Ukraine towards capitulating to Russia’s demands, as “very important” and the situation as “very serious”.\n\nPoland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, told a cabinet meeting in Warsaw that Europe faced unprecedented risks, including “the biggest in the last few decades when it comes to security”.\n\nTusk said his government would have to make some “extraordinary” decisions. “A decision was announced to suspend the US aid for Ukraine, and perhaps start lifting sanctions on Russia. We don’t have any reason to think these are just words,” he said.\n\n\n\n“This puts Europe, Ukraine, Poland in a more difficult situation,” he said, adding that Warsaw was determined to “intensify activities in Europe to increase our defence capabilities” while maintaining the best possible relations with the US.\n\nThe French minister for European affairs, Benjamin Haddad, said Trump’s move had made the prospect of peace more distant because it “only strengthens the hand of the aggressor on the ground, which is Russia”.\n\nGermany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said: “Two things are now essential for peace through strength: additional aid - military and financial - for Ukraine, which is defending our freedom. And a quantum leap to strengthen our EU defence.”\n\nEU leaders are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss a five-part, €800bn (£660bn) plan presented by the European commission to bolster Europe’s defence industry, increase military capability and help provide urgent military support for Ukraine.\n\nA spokesperson for the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who hosted a crisis meeting of European and other leaders on Sunday, said London was “absolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine” and was engaging with key allies.\n\nThe spokesperson said the UK had already committed to provide Ukraine with £3bn a year in military aid for as long as it took and was providing a £2.26bn loan using sanctioned Russian assets.\n\nThe Czech Republic’s prime minister, Petr Fiala, called for a fundamental shift in European policy, saying Trump’s decision meant “we must strengthen our economic and military capabilities and take full responsibility for our own security”.\n\nEurope would have to increase significantly defence investment, he said, adding that “ensuring our security also means intensifying our support for Ukraine. We cannot allow Russia’s aggressive policy, which threatens us all, to succeed.”\n\nEstonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said Europe must step up assistance to Ukraine to fill the gap left by the US freeze, which followed a public bust-up in the White House between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "A brutal season for the Phoenix Suns hit a low Sunday night with a humiliating 116-98 home loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n“We didn’t play up to our standards at all,” All-Star forward Kevin Durant said. “We embarrassed the fans and we embarrassed ourselves the way we played. I want us to be better.”\n\nThere’s not much evidence that’s going to happen.\n\nPhoenix lost for the 11th time in 14 games and fell to 28-33 for the season. The team is four games behind the Dallas Mavericks for the final spot in the Western Conference play-in tournament and will need a minor miracle over the last 21 games of the season just to have a chance at the postseason.\n\nIt’s far from the situation that the Suns expected back in October. They started the year with championship aspirations with a highly-paid and accomplished roster that includes Durant, four-time All-Star Devin Booker and three-time All-Star Bradley Beal.\n\nBut after an encouraging 8-1 start to the season, the Suns have a 20-31 record since 13 November. Injuries haven’t helped, but the Suns were at full strength Sunday night and still got routed in their own building.\n\n“We’ve got to go on a run, but it’s got to start,” coach Mike Budenholzer said. “There’s no doubt that the standings, the circumstances that we’re in, there’s an awareness and we’ve got to do something to change it.”\n\nPhoenix actually led 51-49 at halftime Sunday, but Minnesota rallied for an 83-72 lead heading into the fourth.\n\nThat’s when things really went south for the Suns, who didn’t appear to be giving much effort in the final minutes. They had nine turnovers in the fourth quarter including several that led directly to easy Minnesota baskets. Beal was called for a Flagrant 1 foul when he pushed Anthony Edwards on a dunk attempt.\n\nScattered boos were heard from the home crowd in the final minutes.\n\nThe Timberwolves – led by Edwards’ 44 points – were the far superior team. Julius Randle returned after missing more than a month with a groin injury and had 20 points. Donte DiVincenzo torched the Suns for eight three-pointers and the Phoenix defense appeared to have little interest in guarding him at times.\n\nMinnesota was the team that swept the Suns out of the playoffs last season in the first round. The Timberwolves have won all three regular-season meetings this year.\n\n“When adversity hits, we start floating a little as a team,” Durant said. “That’s tough to deal with it.”\n\nPhoenix tied a season high with 22 turnovers and gave up a season-high 40 points off those turnovers. Durant, Booker and Beal combined for 14 of the turnovers.\n\n“That’s why we lost,” Durant said. “Forty points off turnovers, tough to overcome that. They didn’t overpower us on the glass, we just gave them the ball.”",

        "content": "James Harrison, the Australian known as “the man with the golden arm” because of his prolific baby-saving blood donations, has died aged 88.\n\nIn his lifetime, Harrison rolled up his sleeve more than 1,100 times to give his plasma which was then used in 2.4m doses of anti-D medication to save at-risk newborn babies.\n\nHarrison’s blood was special because it contained what the Australian Red Cross described as a “rare and precious” antibody, essential to make anti-D injections.\n\nAnti-D injections are a life-saving medication given to RhD-negative mothers whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. Without it, their babies can suffer haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn (HDFN), which can be fatal.\n\nHarrison first donated blood in 1954 and reportedly never missed a fortnightly appointment. His final donation was in 2018, aged 81. He was inspired after undergoing lung surgery as a 14-year-old, himself receiving many blood transfusions, the Red Cross said.\n\nSince the introduction of the anti-D treatment in the 1960s, mothers and babies no longer face the adverse outcomes of HDFN.\n\nThe disease occurs when blood types of a mother and baby are incompatible and can result in miscarriage, stillbirth and other complications.\n\nDr David De Leacy, a retired Australian pathologist and transfusion specialist, said the disease was now “an historical problem” thanks to anti-D.\n\nHe likened the anti-D treatment to immunisation against any other virus, with babies protected if administered early enough.\n\nThe only catch is people like Harrison and his blood are rare. In 1999 Harrison was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia.\n\n“He was … very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain,” Harrison’s daughter, Tracey Mellowship, told the Red Cross in a statement.\n\n“It made him happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness.”\n\nThe CEO of Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, Stephen Cornelissen, described Harrison as a “remarkable, stoically kind” man who “extended his arm to help others and babies he would never know”.\n\nIn Australia, the Red Cross said recruiting new anti-D donors was as an ongoing challenge. It has fewer than 200 anti-D donors nationwide, who help about 45,000 mothers and their babies each year.\n\nIn addition to the 2m doses from his donations, labs still hold blood from Harrison.\n\nUsing blood from Harrison and other donors, Australian scientists are attempting to grow the anti-D antibody in a lab – a process the Red Cross has fondly dubbed “James in a jar”.\n\nHarrison died in his sleep on 17 February, the Red Cross said.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Steph Curry dunked!\n\nFor the first time in six years, the Golden State Warriors star had the ball alone for a seemingly easy uncontested layup, when he instead threw down a one-handed jam against the 76ers.\n\nCurry dunked for the first time since 21 February 2019, at the Warriors’ old home, the Oracle Arena. Curry noted – after he scored 29 points and 13 assists in Saturday night’s loss to Philadelphia – he never dunked at the new home, the Chase Center.\n\nFor good measure, the four-time NBA champion and league career 3-point leader says he never will.\n\nCurry, who turns 37 this month, said after the game he was retired from dunking.\n\nCurry’s breakaway dunk cut the 76ers’ lead to 109-104 midway through the fourth quarter.\n\n“I’ve been feeling pretty good,” Curry said. “I’ve been dealing with some knee stuff all year. Take advantage of a cherrypick opportunity. That will probably be my last dunk, though. I’m calling it right now, that was the last one you’ll ever see.”\n\nWarriors assistant coach Jerry Stackhouse had teased Curry about his lack of dunking during a morning shootaround. After Curry’s slam, he pointed toward Stackhouse on the bench.\n\n“It was a very random comment this morning and the fact that it happened was hilarious,” Curry said.\n\nSave the viral social media clip. There won’t be another one.\n\n“For sure,” Curry said. “I will only lay the ball up. It took everything out of me to get up there.”",

        "title": "Federal layoffs hit the deep-red, rural US west: ‘Our public lands are under threat’",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Republican representative McKay Erickson walked through the halls of the Wyoming capitol with a Trump 2024 pin on the front of his suit jacket. Much of Erickson’s home district in Lincoln county falls under the jurisdiction of the Bridger-Teton national forest and Grand Teton national park.\n\nWith that federal land, comes federal workers. While it appears districts in Wyoming crucial to US energy dominance have been spared the brunt of the layoffs, McKay said his forest-heavy district has not been so fortunate. He’s hearing from his constituents about the layoffs, and he’s troubled about the implications for his district’s future.\n\n“These people have a face to me,” Erickson said. “They have a face and a place in either Star Valley or Jackson that I know quite well.”\n\nErickson is a small-government conservative, laments bureaucracy and stands by his belief that there’s a need to “cut the fat” at the federal level. But in his district, he foresees a lack of trail maintenance hurting local outfitting companies and understaffed parks with closed gates.\n\n“This way is so indiscriminate, and it doesn’t really drill down on the real issue as to where those cuts need to be,” Erickson said. “I’m afraid that probably all we’re going to lose is services.”\n\nErickson’s district is in a bind that’s playing out across the American west.\n\nWyoming, for the third presidential election in a row, voted for Donald Trump by a wider margin than any other state in the country. Neighboring states Idaho and Montana also swung red with mile-wide margins. All three have high proportions of federal land (Idaho – 62%, Wyoming – 48%, Montana – 29%), and thriving outdoor recreation industries dependent on public lands.\n\nErickson, while watching cuts with apprehension, said that he is still supportive of the president, who won more than 81% of presidential votes cast in Lincoln county in 2024.\n\n“It hasn’t really shaken me. It’s concerned me, but not shaken me in my support,” Erickson said.\n\nAs layoffs under Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) bleed out of the Beltway and across the country, local business owners, politicians and federal employees in the rural Mountain West told the Guardian that they feared devastating consequences for their communities.\n\nThe Guardian reached out to US senators from Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, some of whom have publicly praised Doge’s work, about their constituents’ concerns. None responded to a request for comment.\n\nFew towns represent the ties between small town economies and public lands better than Salmon, Idaho. With a population of just over 3,000, Salmon is cradled by a nest of federal lands, including the Salmon-Challis national forest, the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness and a smattering of Bureau of Land Management holdings.\n\nDustin Aherin calls Salmon home, and is the president of Middle Fork Outfitters Association, which represents 27 local businesses. He said that the day-to-day duties of forestry service employees, from river patrol to permitting to conservation, keep businesses like his alive. Recent layoffs put their future in jeopardy.\n\n“The team in the field that manages the Middle Fork and Main Salmon river, all but two were terminated. And the two that were left have been reassigned,” Aherin said. “We have no on-the-ground management as of right now.”\n\nThe urgency caused by the layoffs sent Aherin to Capitol Hill, where he spoke with the Guardian between meetings with federal officials. He held cautious optimism that Idaho’s federal delegation would be able to help craft a solution.\n\nA hundred miles south-west of Salmon, in Stanley, Idaho, Hannah, a terminated employee from the Sawtooth national forest who requested anonymity, has a grim outlook for the future of the small mountain town. She said that about 40% of staff was cut, including the entire wilderness and trail crew. She wonders who will handle the public-facing jobs, from cleaning toilets and campgrounds to providing visitor information, and worries about the effects on Stanley, which took a major hit in the 2024 wildfire season.\n\n“In a small town like this where you only have a couple good months of a summer season, one hard year and another hard-ish year could be really bad for some local businesses,” Hannah said.\n\nHannah said the termination cost her her health insurance just weeks before a costly surgery, and she expects to have to relocate. In the early stages of her career, she said the experience will likely sour her, and other young civil servants, on public service.\n\n“We’re losing the next generation of public land stewards,” Hannah said. “And our public lands are under threat.”\n\nSimilar anxiety is creeping into communities surrounding the Mountain West’s marquee national parks, which are economic engines for the region. A 2023 report estimated that National Parks generated more than $55bn in economic impact off of a budget of $3.6bn. Many of these dollars went to gateway towns in red states, such as those framing the entrances to Grand Teton national park or Yellowstone national park.\n\nDale Sexton, owner of Dan Bailey’s fly shop in Livingston, Montana, is helping push the revival of the Yellowstone Business Coalition, whose 400-plus members are lobbying Montana’s federal delegation to work to address the effects of federal layoffs. Sexton is pragmatic about the national political climate and is betting that an economics-based argument will move the needle.\n\n“I’m envisioning that our delegation currently doesn’t want to abandon the Doge ship,” Sexton said. “But I’m also hopeful that outcry becomes so loud that it garners their attention and affects change.”\n\nLivingston city commissioner Karrie Kahle envisions a trickle-down effect from the layoffs.\n\n“As we lose federal workers first, if one of them is lost, we’re potentially losing a whole family from our community,” Kahle said. “If that federal worker has a partner, is that partner a teacher or doing other work in our community? Are we going to lose kids out of our school systems?”\n\nAndrea Shiverdecker, an archaeologist in Montana’s Custer-Gallatin national forest, lost her job on Valentine’s Day. Along with the impact on her personal life and community, Shiverdecker dwells on potential consequences for Yellowstone.\n\n“I don’t think people understand the sheer volume and amount of people that come through our ecosystem every year and the amount of manpower it takes to keep cleaned up,” Shiverdecker said. “This is what we fear with our public lands … We need to be stewards and foster them for future generations.”\n\nShiverdecker said the layoff process has been disorienting. She said she was terminated 25 days before the end of her probationary period, while paperwork was being run for her promotion. She said she believes in “good people” and hopes to somehow return to her job, but right now, she has a lot of frustration.\n\n“How am I getting laid off for performance issues when you were processing my promotion?” Shiverdecker said. “It’s heartbreaking as a dedicated public servant, as a disabled veteran, as somebody who loves the fact that they’ve served. That’s the biggest honor you can give.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Taiwan’s government has promised its most advance semiconductor technology will not be moved to the US under a new $100bn (£79bn) deal signed between the chip maker TSMC and Donald Trump, amid accusations that it is allowing the island’s national security to be undermined.\n\nThe government said the deal must still go through government assessments, which would take into account the interests of the country as well as investors.\n\nThe surprise announcement on Monday by Trump and the chief executive of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), CC Wei, has prompted controversy and confusion in Taiwan, where the industry is crucial to its economy and national security.\n\nOn Monday, TSMC said it would increase its existing US investment by $100bn, building five new “cutting edge” facilities on US soil.\n\nTrump said the deal meant TSMC would avoid the industry-wide 25% tariffs amid efforts to bring more manufacturing to the US and assert US trade dominance over rivals and allies. Wei said the deal meant TSMC was “producing the most advanced chip on US soil”.\n\nThat statement has been called into question by pledges from government officials that the tightly protected tech would stay onshore. The presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo, said the government would ensure TSMC “will keep its most advanced manufacturing processes in Taiwan”.\n\nBut the specifics of any restrictions are unclear. In November, Taiwanese officials and media said TSMC would begin production of its most advanced 2-nanometer chip in its US facilities from about 2028. Asked if this was still the case, officials referred the Guardian to comments by economics minister on Tuesday, saying “next year, 2nm and 1.6nm [chips] will not be produced in the US”.\n\nTSMC and the ministry of economics have been contacted for clarification.\n\nGovernment statements also suggested TSMC had not yet applied for government approvals required for foreign investments of that size, when the deal was announced. The Taiwan minister of economic affairs, Kuo Jyh-Huei, said that assessment would “take into account the interests of investors and the country”.\n\nKuo, however, emphasised that the office had “full knowledge” of TSMC-related investments in advance.\n\nTSMC produces almost all of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, and the industry is often referred to as Taiwan’s “silicon shield”, incentivising the US and allies to support Taiwan against Chinese invasion in order to keep the tech out of Beijing’s control.\n\nOpposition figures have said the deal would reduce Taiwan’s defences. The defence minister, however, said he was still convinced the US would protect Taiwan.\n\n“Taking away Taiwan’s technology sector will reduce the power of Taiwan’s’ ‘silicon shield’,” said James Yifan Chen, the assistant professor in the department of diplomacy and international relations at Tamkang University in Taiwan. “Taiwan without semiconductor and tech industries will be like Ukraine without nuclear weapons.”\n\nThe deal drew criticism from the opposition in Taiwan. The leader of the KMT’s legislative caucus, Fu Kun-chi, asked “Where is Taiwan’s national security if TSMC become ASMC and the sacred mountain that protects the country is gone?”\n\n“The more TSMC produces in the US, the lower Taiwan’s geopolitical importance will be, and the less incentive the US will have to help Taiwan in the future,” said the KMT legislator Ko Ju-Chun.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Koo said the “rapid and strange” changes in the international situation had raised questions about Trump’s core interests, but he believed the cost of a Taiwan war was too high for the US to allow it to happen.\n\n“I think it is impossible for the US to withdraw from the Indo-Pacific because it is the core interest of the US, whether from the perspective of economic growth, political views or military security,” he said.\n\nTaiwan’s government has scrambled to deter Trump from imposing tariffs on Taiwan and crucial industries. It has sent government delegations to Washington, and promised to increase defence spending and reduce its trade surplus with the US. The TSMC deal was widely seen as a move to avoid tariffs, an outcome Trump said had been achieved, but Kuo on Tuesday rejected suggestions it was related.\n\n“TSMC already has plants in the US and Japan, and it’s now building new a plant in Germany,” Kuo said. “These have nothing to do with tariffs. TSMC’s global expansion is a crucial development.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Jason Tzu-kuan Lu and agencies",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Ukraine has reacted with defiance and anger to Donald Trump’s suspension of all US military aid, saying the decision amounted to betrayal by an ally and would help Russia to bomb and kill more civilians.\n\nDeliveries of ammunition and vehicles have ceased, including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president. Ukrainians said the biggest impact was likely to be on Ukraine’s ability to defend itself from Russian air attacks, which have escalated in recent weeks.\n\nUkraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said the White House was trying to “bully” Volodymyr Zelenskyy into accepting a bad peace deal on Moscow’s brutal terms. If Kyiv did not agree, US military aid would be halted permanently, he predicted.\n\n“I think this is extremely wrong on all different levels,” Zagorodnyuk told the Guardian. “Also it will not work with Ukraine. Ukraine will never bend to bullies, and to bullying. It’s as simple as that.”\n\nIn a video address recorded from Kyiv before Monday night’s announcement, Zelenskyy repeated his calls for a “just” settlement of the war. It followed a hostile social media post by Trump claiming that Ukraine’s president did not want peace. “We need peace, true and honest peace – not endless war,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe made clear that any deal had to come with security guarantees – the same position that triggered anger from Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance, when Zelenskyy met them on Friday in the Oval Office.\n\nZelenskyy said security guarantees were “essential”. He pointed out that it was a lack of guarantees that allowed Russia to seize Crimea in 2014 and begin a covert takeover of the Donbas region. Subsequently, it led to Russia’s full-scale 2022 invasion and to its continuing war, he said.\n\nWithout mentioning the US, Zelenskyy added: “The world sees this, and the world acknowledges it. Today, we continued our work with European partners on a special diplomatic and security architecture that can bring us closer to peace.”\n\nUkrainian journalists and commentators noted bitterly that Trump had so far demanded no concessions from Vladimir Putin. The White House’s latest punitive move against Ukraine would lead to “joy in Moscow”, they said.\n\nInstead of acting as a mediator, Trump had sought to squeeze and humiliate Ukraine and force it into territorial concessions that would benefit the Kremlin, they said. Russia says it has “annexed” four Ukrainian regions, including cities it does not control such as Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nThere was a consensus that Trump had already decided to cut US aid before his acrimonious meeting on Friday with Zelenskyy, with the row stirred up deliberately and now used as a pretext. The US was actively aiding Russia, at the expense of Ukraine, it was suggested.\n\n“This isn’t a peace plan, it’s a trap to force our surrender,” Maria Avdeeva, a Ukrainian security expert, posted on BlueSky. She added: “Siding with Russia never helped anyone. Putin isn’t negotiating – he wants our capitulation. Ukraine will remain strong.”\n\nThe philosopher and essayist Volodymyyr Yermolenko acknowledged that the consequences would be extremely painful for ordinary Ukrainians. Even before the shutdown, Ukrainian cities and towns were under massive bombardment from drones and ballistic missiles.\n\n“This war is a slaughter. The Russians are mostly killing defenceless civilians. By halting assistance (primarily air defence), Trump is helping to escalate this slaughter even further,” Yermolenko wrote.\n\nSome observers expressed optimism that Ukraine had been written off before and would prevail against the odds once again. They noted that Putin originally expected to conquer Ukraine within three days back in 2022. Three years later, his troops are still fighting and bogged down in an attritional war.\n\n“We shall endure this as well,” the writer and blogger Ilia Ponomarenko posted.\n\n",

        "content": "04.25 EST US dollar weakens amid rising 'Trumpcession' fears\n\nThe US dollar is weakening today, amid growing concerns that Donald Trump’s policies could push America’s economy into a contraction, and possibly a full-blown recession.\n\nThe dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of rival currencies, has dropped by 0.44% today, as traders anticipate that a trade war will drive up US inflation and hurt its economy.\n\nSterling has risen 0.2% to $1.2724 against the dollar, its highest level since 17 December. The euro is up 0.3% at $1.052.\n\nThe dollar’s weakness comes as markets now expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interast rates three times this year. In January and February, only one or two cuts were priced in.\n\nInvestors are jumpy after a closely watched gauge of the US economy weakened yesterday.\n\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model now estimates US GDP will shrink at an annualised rate of 2.8% in January-March, the equivalent of a 0.7% quarterly decline in activity. That helped to prompt yesterday’s losses on Wall Street.\n\nOn March 3, the #GDPNow model nowcast of real GDP growth in Q1 2025 is -2.8%: https://t.co/T7FoDdgYos. #ATLFedResearch\n\n\n\nDownload our EconomyNow app or go to our website for the latest GDPNow nowcast: https://t.co/NOSwMl7Jms. pic.twitter.com/FdSehrEcSg — Atlanta Fed (@AtlantaFed) March 3, 2025\n\nThat helped to prompt yesterday’s losses on the US stock market, even though the Atlanta Fed GDPNow can be volatile.\n\nKyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, explains:\n\nWall Street tumbled off the back of the news, while the US Dollar declined as market participants began to contemplate the risks of a US recession. While much of the change is due to mechanical factors in the way GDP is calculated, a deepening trade deficit along with signs of weaker consumer spending and business activity has driven the Atlanta Fed’s GDP Nowcast to -2.8%. Subsequently, the markets have shifted forward expectations of the next Fed rate cut to June, with May increasingly looking like a “live” meeting.\n\nTalk of a “Trumpcession” has been growing in recent days, after the latest trade data last week showed a surge of imports as businesses tried to avoid new tariffs.\n\nManufacturing data yesterday showed a slowdown in US factory growth in February, with employment levels and new orders both contracting.\n\nAn index of US consumer confidence hit an eight-month low last month, while US retail sales dropped by the most in nearly two years in January.\n\nA CBS News poll released on Sunday showed that 49% of Americans disapprove of president Trump’s handling of the economy.\n\nStephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, says talk of a ‘self-inflicted “Trumpcession.”’ is on the rise:\n\nAlready queasy from a fading AI-driven rally, Wall Street is now staring down a worsening cocktail of Trump’s tariff fury, stretched equity valuations, and the cold, hard realization that the U.S. economy may be losing steam. Meanwhile, across the pond, Europe—long the ugly duckling of global markets—is suddenly the belle of the ball. While America grapples with an economic hangover, European stocks are ripping higher, fueled by a mix of bargain-hunting, fiscal policy shifts, and the tantalizing prospect of a peace deal in Ukraine. The euro and bond yields are climbing, while the dollar and Treasuries slump—proof that global capital is rebalancing. Defence and infrastructure spending is setting the tone for a European revival, while Washington is left debating whether it’s about to stumble into a self-inflicted “Trumpcession.”\n\nA recession, though, would mean two quarterly contactions in GDP in a row – which Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, doesn’t see happening.\n\nHe wrote last week:",

The US president’s announcement “was made without any information or consultation, neither with Nato allies nor with the Ramstein group which is involved in supporting Ukraine,” the ministry spokesperson Paweł Wroński said on Tuesday. Wroński described the decision, which piles pressure on Kyiv’s remaining allies to step up alternative aid and appearsintended to push Ukraine towards capitulating to Russia’s demands, as “very important” and the situation as “very serious”. Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, told a cabinet meeting in Warsaw that Europe now faced unprecedented risks, including “the biggest in the last few decades when it comes to security”. Tusk said his government would have to make some “extraordinary” decisions. “A decision was announced to suspend the US aid for Ukraine, and perhaps start lifting sanctions on Russia. We don’t have any reason to think these are just words,” he said.\n\n\n\n“This puts Europe, Ukraine, Poland in a more difficult situation,” he said, adding that Warsaw was determined to “intensify activities in Europe to increase our defence capabilities” while maintaining the best possible relations with the US.

Lawmakers were scheduled to vote on a law that would increase funding for university education, but opposition parties insisted the session was illegal and should first confirm the resignation of prime minister Miloš Vučević and his government. Local media RTS reported that “Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabić said MP Jasmina Obradović, who was hit by a stun gun, suffered a stroke and is fighting for her life. MP Jasmina Karanac was also injured, as was Sonja Ilić, who is eight months pregnant.” The details have not been independently verified by the Guardian.

According to the 2025 annual report by Supo, the Finnish security and intelligence service, published on Tuesday, an end to the war in Ukraine would “improve the ability of Russia to engage in hostile activity elsewhere in Europe”. This would also “increase the threat to Finland,” it said. The report also warned that multiple states, including Russia, have increased their use of proxies both in intelligence and broader influencing campaigns, including in an attempt to “undermine western support for Ukraine”. In the report, Supo said: Sabotage operations in Europe linked to the Russian military intelligence service GRU are one example of this. By using intermediaries, Russia seeks to cover its tracks. Russian sabotage operations aim to influence public opinion and the sense of public safety, and to overwhelm the authorities in target countries. The main goal at the moment is to undermine western support for Ukraine. Finland is a target for “continuous and active espionage operations” from Russia and China, it said, as well as Iran. Supo director, Juha Martelius, said: The western intelligence community has a highly uniform view of the growing threat from Russia. As a country that borders Russia and as a state on the Baltic Sea, Finland must prepare for growth in Russian influencing.

        "title": "The Trade™, three weeks on: Dončić, Davis and the art of the NBA breakup",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "“A lot of emotions, not much sleep … I’m just glad it’s over.” Those were Luka Dončić’s succinct and surprisingly vulnerable initial thoughts on Tuesday night after his first rendezvous with his former team, the Dallas Mavericks, when his Lakers hosted them in Los Angeles. It was a highly anticipated game, the culmination of weeks of NBA drama after the biggest blockbuster trade in league history, when the 25-year-old was traded for 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Davis was sidelined on the bench with an adductor strain on Tuesday, which slightly dampened the dramatic potential. But with both Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison and minority owner Mark Cuban joining Lakers GM Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss in attendance, the tension was palpable. There’s really no such thing as a clean breakup, but this one has been particularly messy, and as much as the basketball itself has started to round into shape for both clubs, the wounds from the parting have only just begun to heal.\n\nThe “wins” and “losses” of the trade have been covered ad nauseam. The basketball of it all, the Xs and Os, what may work, what may not, have been dissected to death. The drama, trying to figure out what conspiracy theories could have been at play to set it into motion, has made for unassailably compelling television. But, as is the case in many sports sagas, the human element of it all seems to have become somewhat lost in the shuffle.\n\nAs anyone who has been unceremoniously and unsuspectingly dumped can attest, even if it’s ultimately for the best in the long run, it hurts. Add to that the disorienting vertigo of being uprooted and sent to a new city overnight, and throw in some loud media discourse narrating the entire experience, and it’s easy to see why trades aren’t ever as simple as shuffling deck chairs. “When you move on, or they move on from you, it’s very emotional, obviously, and very taxing,” LeBron James told reporters on Tuesday when asked how he thought his new teammate handled the emotionally charged circumstances. “There are probably a lot of things going on in his head that don’t even involve the game itself. And with that said, I thought he handled it tremendously.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Anthony Davis of the Dallas Mavericks talks with former teammate Dorian Finney-Smith of the Los Angeles Lakers before Tuesday’s game. Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Getty Images\n\nThe Mavericks have responded to widespread criticism for trading away their young perennial MVP candidate and franchise face by, in true post-breakup fashion, dragging Dončić’s name through the mud in what seems like an almost daily stream of targeted leaks, alluding to his alleged drinking, lack of dedication to fitness and work ethic, among other gripes. That has certainly fanned the flames of keeping the transaction in the public discourse, even as both teams involved purport to embark on their respective title chases.\n\n“Awkward as shit” was how Dončić’s former teammate Kyrie Irving described their first duel as opponents since the trade. And there were certainly plenty of awkward moments, like when a subset of the Crypto.com Arena crowd chanted “Thank you, Nico!” in reference to the maligned Mavericks GM. (Davis, fortunately, was sitting on the opposite side of the arena out of earshot on the Dallas bench.)\n\nDavis did get a touching tribute video on his return to LA, complete with a standing ovation from the crowd, and was visibly moved. Davis and his personal experience have been largely sidelined, with most of the discourse focusing on how the Mavericks could be so foolish as to trade away a young superstar who wanted to stay, and on the aforementioned bad-mouthing from the organization in the weeks since. But all reports indicate that Davis, a top-10 player in his own right, didn’t see the trade coming either, and, much like Dončić, expected to be the face of his franchise for the long haul.\n\n“I miss being around him every day,” Lakers head coach JJ Redick said of Davis before Tuesday’s game. “He’s a wonderful human being.” James had similar sentiments. “Our friendship goes without saying,” he said after the reunion, where he and Davis shared a courtside laugh for presumably the first time since the swap. “He’s one of my best friends.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Luka Dončić finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists in Tuesday’s win over the Mavericks. Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Getty Images\n\nThe midseason transition to a new franchise likely wouldn’t have been easy regardless, but for Davis, he’s been handed the sisyphean task of trying to win over a fanbase that feels so slighted by their franchise’s decision-makers that they’ve taken to the streets. To his credit, Davis has handled the situation with grace, empathizing with the feelings of Mavericks fans from day one: “I understand it,” he said at his introductory press conference of the anger around the trade. “But it’s my job to play basketball and come in and do what I’m supposed to do and give the fans hope and reassurance on why Nico brought me here.”\n\nWe asked Redick, who as the Lakers’ coach is not only at the nexus of this specific trade, but who has also experienced being traded against his wishes (ironically, to the same Mavericks team that moved Dončić), what the experience of being dealt away is like from a player perspective. He said that his first trade, from the Orlando Magic to the Los Angeles Clippers, was a bit easier as he and his now-wife hadn’t had kids at the time (both Dončić and Davis are parents). Of the eventual move to Dallas (by way of New Orleans), he said: “I wanted to be somewhere that I had a chance to win a championship. Ideally that would be somewhere that was closer to home [in Brooklyn, where his family stayed behind], ideally somewhere drivable. That didn’t happen. I got traded further away. But it was a blessing in disguise, and I didn’t realize it until [recently]. Because I got to play with Luka for two and a half months, and now I get to coach him.”\n\nDončić and Davis will perhaps see such silver linings eventually, or maybe they’re already beginning to. But steadily progressing or not, the scars will take time to heal. “The closure is going to take a while, I think,” Dončić told reporters after Tuesday’s contest. “It’s not ideal, but I’m glad this game is over. It was a lot of emotions. We’ll go little by little, and every day is better.”",

        "content": "Carl Dean, devoted husband of Dolly Parton and also the inspiration behind Parton’s hit Jolene, died on Monday. He was 82.\n\nAccording to a statement provided to the Associated Press by Parton’s publicist, Dean died in Nashville, Tennessee, and will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending.\n\n“Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can’t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,” Parton wrote in a statement.\n\nThe family has asked for respect and privacy. No cause of death was announced.\n\nParton met Dean outside the Wishy Washy laundromat the day she moved to Nashville at 18.\n\n“I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me),” Parton described the meeting. “He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about.”\n\nThey married two years later, on Memorial Day – 30 May 1966 – in a small ceremony in Ringgold, Georgia.\n\nDean, a businessman who had owned an asphalt-paving business in Nashville, avoided the spotlight despite his wife’s fame.\n\nParton and Dean kept their relationship private for decades, Parton telling the Associated Press in 1984: “A lot of people say there’s no Carl Dean, that he’s just somebody I made up to keep other people off me.”\n\nShe joked that she would like to pose with him on the cover of a magazine, “so that people could at least know that I’m not married to a wart or something”.\n\nParton’s 1973 classic Jolene was inspired by Dean. Parton told NPR in 2008 that she wrote the song about a flirty bank teller who seemed to take an interest in Dean.\n\n“She got this terrible crush on my husband,” she said. “And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us – when I was saying: ‘Hell, you’re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don’t believe we’ve got that kind of money.’ So it’s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.”\n\nParton also said Dean was the force behind her 2023 Rockstar album.\n\n“He’s a big rock and roller,” she told the AP. The song My Blue Tears, which was written when Parton was with The Porter Wagoner Show in the late 1960s and early ’70s, is “one of my husband’s favorite songs that I ever wrote”, she said. “I thought: ‘Well, I better put one of Carl’s favorites of mine in here.’” She also covered a few of his favorites on the temporary detour from country music: Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Free Bird and Led Zeppelin’s Stairway to Heaven.\n\nDean’s parents, Virginia “Ginny” Bates Dean and Edgar “Ed” Henry Dean, had three children. Parton referred to his mother as “Mama Dean”.\n\nDean is survived by Parton and his two siblings, Sandra and Donnie.",

All parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine,” he also wrote. “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”\n\nThe ongoing crisis in Texas comes as Kennedy reportedly cancelled an upcoming meeting to discuss next year’s flu vaccines, and last month postponed a public meeting on immunization.",

Nonetheless, Kentucky senator Rand Paul sounds displeased with the barrage of tariffs aimed at Mexico and Canada, noting that exports of bourbon, one of his state top products, are set to be affected. Here’s what he wrote on X: US tariffs inevitably bring Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese tariffs which means higher prices for lumber, steel, aluminum and more expensive homes and cars. Retaliatory tariffs lead to lowered US farm exports, lowered bourbon exports, and less international shipping. Tariffs are taxes and if you tax trade you’ll get less trade and less prosperity.

He posted this reponse to a post from the Italian journalist Antonello Guerrara saying he must have been referring to British and French peacekeepers. This is absurdly dishonest. I don’t even mention the UK or France in the clip, both of whom have fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond. And he added this.

Much of Erickson’s home district in Lincoln county falls under the jurisdiction of the Bridger Teton national forest and Grand Teton national park. With that federal land comes federal workers. While it appears districts in Wyoming crucial to US energy dominance have been spared the brunt of the layoffs, McKay said his forest-heavy district has not been so fortunate. He’s hearing from his constituents about the layoffs, and he’s troubled about the implications for his district’s future. “These people have a face to me,” Erickson said. “They have a face and a place in either Star Valley or Jackson that I know quite well.” Erickson is a small-government conservative, laments bureaucracy and stands by his belief that there’s a need to “cut the fat” at the federal level. But in his district, he foresees a lack of trail maintenance hurting local outfitting companies, and understaffed parks with closed gates. “This way is so indiscriminate, and it doesn’t really drill down on the real issue as to where those cuts need to be,” Erickson said. “I’m afraid that probably all we’re going to lose is services.” Erickson’s district is in a bind that’s playing out across the American west.

The report, which was picked up by Russian state media, quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying that “Russia believes that the United States and Iran should resolve all problems through negotiations” and that Moscow “is ready to do everything in its power to achieve this.” Trump last month restored his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran which includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran denies any such intention. Russia has deepened its ties with the Islamic Republic since the start of the Ukraine war, and signed a strategic cooperation treaty with Iran in January.

Before a chamber packed with members of Congress and their guests, the president will lay out his second-term vision after a radical start that has dramatically reshaped both domestic and foreign policy. In just a few weeks since being sworn into office, Trump has empowered Elon Musk to dramatically downsize the federal workforce, threatened allies with tariffs and coddled longtime American foes. His administration has initiated sweeping mass layoffs of federal employees, mobilized officers from nearly every federal law enforcement agency and the US military to carry out his campaign promise of mass deportations, and rattled Europe with his pursuit of a peace deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine on terms preferential to Moscow. New polling shows warning signs for Trump. More Americans held a negative view of Trump’s presidency so far than a positive one, a new CNN survey found. Meanwhile, a poll conducted by NPR/PBS News/Marist showed a majority of people in the US believe the country is headed in the wrong direction and say that the president has been “rushing to make changes without considering the impact”. Yet Trump, emboldened by his return to power, has shown no signs of changing course, even as backlash brews.

US tariffs have come into force of 25% against goods from Canada and Mexico, the US’s two biggest trading partners, and 20% tariffs against China – doubling the levy on China from last month. The duties will affect more than $918bn-worth (£722bn) of US imports from Canada and Mexico. China on Tuesday said it would impose fresh tariffs on a range of agricultural imports from the US next week. Its finance ministry said additional 15% tariffs would be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton, with further 10% tariffs on sorghum, soya beans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on C$30bn-worth ($20.7bn) of US imports. He said previously that Canada would target US beer, wine, bourbon, home appliances and Florida orange juice. Tariffs will be placed on another C$125bn ($86.2bn) of US goods if Trump’s tariffs were still in place in 21 days.

The lack of so-called “read outs” for workers with clearances dismissed by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency in February could raise security risks as they dealt with secret information on everything from managing nuclear weapons to protecting the power grid from influence by adversaries and ensuring the safety of US international development staffers, former security officials said. Dismissed employees with top-secret clearances are normally given a final security briefing reminding them of non-disclosure agreements they signed when they got the clearance, Reuters reported. They would also sign forms acknowledging that disclosing any kind of classified information is illegal and turn in their laptops, said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two sources with top security clearances dismissed by DOGE, one at the Department of Energy and one former senior official at the US Agency for International Development, told Reuters they were not debriefed. Another worker still at the DOE, said several of the 28 workers fired on Feb. 14 at the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation’s nuclear arsenal, had clearances and were not debriefed.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "It was, says Chris Lemons, “very much a normal day at the office”. Until things went wrong. But when they went wrong, they went wrong very badly, very quickly. The “office” was actually the bottom of the North Sea, where Lemons was left without air for almost half an hour.\n\nLemons was working as a saturation diver, living in a pressurised chamber onboard a specialised ship for stints of up to a month, and being lowered to the seabed in a diving bell to work on offshore structures. “It is a serious business, but it is routine for us. That bell going down is like the taxi to work. I always felt comfortable down there.”\n\nOn 18 September 2012, Lemons, along with colleagues Duncan Allcock and Dave Yuasa, took their diving-bell “taxi” to work at a depth of 90 metres (295ft). Allcock, the most experienced of the three and something of a mentor to Lemons, was to stay in the bell while Lemons and Yuasa dropped out in their diving suits to repair a pipe on a manifold, a big yellow drilling structure used by the oil industry, about the size of a house. Saturation divers are attached to the bell with umbilicals, cables that provide them with communication, power and light, as well as a mixture of oxygen and helium to breathe, hot water to keep them warm, and a means to find their route back to the safety of the bell. “Our umbilicals are exactly what they sound like: givers of life,” says Lemons, 45, on a video call from the south of France where he now lives.\n\nThe bell in turn was connected to the ship, the dive support vessel Topaz, which had a crew of 120 and was positioned 103km (64 miles) north-east of Aberdeen. The ship held its place over the dive area without an anchor, guided by a “dynamic positioning” computer system.\n\nOn that day, the weather was bad – 35 knots of wind and a 5.5-metre (18ft) swell – but not unusual for the North Sea, nor prohibitive to diving. “We don’t really notice that on the bottom,” says Lemons. In fact, though it was dark, visibility wasn’t too bad. “Generally in the North Sea you can’t see much. That is half the battle, being able to orient yourself. But on that occasion, we could see the bell from where we were.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Very much a normal day at the office’ … Lemons and a colleague in the diving bell on board the Topaz. Photograph: Courtesy of Chris Lemons\n\nThey had been working for about an hour when things went wrong. There was an open line of communication to the ship and they heard alarms going off. Not unusual, but then came a message from the ship directly to Lemons and Yuasa: “Leave everything there – get out of the structure, boys.”\n\nThey dropped off the manifold to the seabed. “That’s when the confusion started,” says Lemons. “Going up to the surface is never an option – you would die from explosive decompression pretty quickly. There is only one safe place: the diving bell.”\n\nBut the diving bell, which had been 10 metres (33ft) above them, wasn’t there. The Topaz’s dynamic positioning system had failed and the ship was drifting off in the gale, pulling the bell with it. But the bell was still attached to the other end of their umbilicals, so they began to climb the cables. “I don’t remember processing what was going on. You’re just trying to get back to that safe place, climbing hand over hand, as did Dave next to me.”\n\nI thought I was going to get pulled through the structure – that’s not a nice way to go\n\nBut, suddenly, Lemons couldn’t climb any more. A loop of his umbilical had snagged on the manifold they’d been working on. The ship pulled on the bell, which pulled on the umbilical. “I immediately knew it was caught. You’ve got this 8,000-tonne vessel pulling that umbilical tight – there was nothing I could do to release it.”\n\nIn fact, because the cable was caught on part of the manifold, Lemons initially found himself being pulled back into it. “I was thrashing around like a fish trying to get out of there, shouting for slack. My next thought was that if it continued to slip, there was a small gap in the structure I was going to get pulled through, like being pulled through a cheese grater. That’s not going to be a nice way to go. The first real dose of luck I had was that it stopped slipping.” It’s a testament to Lemons’s talent for understatement, and the absolutely desperate situation, that he sees this as luck.\n\nSoon, Yuasa noticed that Lemons was in trouble: “He realised there was a problem and turned to get back to me. We couldn’t speak to each other, but I remember our eyes meeting. I’m imploring him to help me, but he’s being dragged away. I lost sight of him, but I could still see his light. Then I lost sight of that.”\n\n‘Going up to the surface is never an option’ … Lemons in the bell. Photograph: Courtesy of Chris Lemons\n\nMeanwhile, the ship continued to pull on Lemons’s umbilical. He doesn’t remember hearing the cable break; it happened in stages, comms first, “like a jack being pulled from a speaker. I lost all communication, which puts you in a very lonely place. Then [I lost] the hose which provides an infinite amount of gas – suddenly I had nothing to breathe at all.”\n\nYuasa made it back to the bell, exhausted. On the ship, they desperately tried to get the dynamic positioning system running again. Meanwhile, Lemons did what saturation divers are trained to do. “We carry these emergency supplies. You never expect to have to use them, but when you’ve suddenly got nothing to breathe it’s an instinctual thing to turn the knob on the side of the helmet to open the supply. That puts you in a very different world: the moment that you open that, you’ve moved from a place where you have this infinite supply to one where you very much have a finite one – about eight or nine minutes’ worth.”\n\nWhen the umbilical broke, Lemons had fallen back on to the seabed. His first task was to find the manifold, which is where a rescue attempt, if there was one, would take place. But that wasn’t easy without a light. “It was the most infinite darkness. I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. It’s easy to get disoriented at the best of times, with a compass and a light and someone telling you where to go. I knew this enormous yellow structure was probably only a couple of metres away, but I had no idea which direction. Again, I was very lucky – I bumped straight into it.”\n\nIt was the most infinite darkness – I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face\n\nHe climbed up the manifold, fearful of letting go and losing it again, and got to the top. “For some reason, I expected to see Dave on his way back to me, or the diving bell. But when I got there and looked up, there was nothing but the most absolute blackness in the sea above me.”\n\nIt was cold, about 3C (37F), and Lemons had lost his hot water supply. “I would have been hypothermically cold very quickly, but I don’t have a memory of that. Maybe your body has an ability to shut out unnecessary information. Or perhaps my memory is not as good as I thought. I feel I’ve got this fairly lucid recollection of everything up to the point where I fall unconscious.”\n\nHe reckons that of the eight or nine minutes of gas he had, he’d probably used four or five. “I won’t pretend I wasn’t scared and breathing hard. I realised that even if Dave had been there, the chances of him getting me back to a breathable environment before I ran out of gas were minimal. With nobody there, I decided this was probably going to be it. In a strange way, that had a calming effect; the fear, the panic drained out of me – there was nothing I could do. I assumed a sort of foetal position and was overtaken by grief. A great sadness took over at that point.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Finn Cole as Lemons, Woody Harrelson as Allcock and Simu Liu as Yuasa in Last Breath, the film based on Lemons’s accident. Photograph: FlixPix/Alamy\n\nWhat was he thinking of in that moment? “I was at an exciting point in my life: early 30s, getting married the following year, we were in the process of building a house … I had all the hopes and dreams you have at that stage – of children, travel – and it felt as if all of that was about to be ripped away in this strange, lonely, ethereal place. I grew up in a middle-class family on the outskirts of Cambridge, and I remember thinking: ‘How is this dark, lonely place where I end my days?’”\n\nHe also tells me he was worried what they were going to find on his mobile phone, but then says he’s joking. Lemons is very funny – that doesn’t come across in the documentary that was made about his accident.\n\nWe underestimate what we’re capable of - it’s given me courage and confidence\n\nIn the 2019 documentary Last Breath, interviews with Lemons, Yuasa, Allcock and others are interwoven with footage from the day and some reconstructed scenes. The most powerful, haunting footage is taken from a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), like a mini, unmanned submarine, which was launched from the Topaz. Lemons is lying on top of the structure, in the foetal position, and his arm is moving, twitching. Some of the ship’s crew take it to be a sign that he’s waving at the ROV, letting them know he’s still alive and they need to get a move on. Today, Lemons dismisses this. “I’m definitely unconscious at the point where the ROV finds me. We’ve got a few theories as to what that was.” To put it another way: he was not waving but drowning.\n\nHe doesn’t remember the moment he lost consciousness. He thinks it was the carbon dioxide that put him under, and that’s why the “actual moment was peaceful. I feel like a bit of a charlatan. I still get contacted all the time by people who’ve lost loved ones, but I don’t have the right to tell you what it’s like – I didn’t die.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘The actual moment was peaceful’ … Lemons lying unconscious at the bottom of the North Sea. Photograph: Courtesy of Chris Lemons\n\nSomehow, they got the dynamic positioning system going again and relocated the manifold. Allcock and Yuasa were still in the bell. Yuasa left the bell again to get Lemons, presumably expecting to bring back a body. It had been 35 minutes since his umbilical snapped, and Lemons had just eight or nine minutes of emergency gas.\n\nThey dragged him back into the bell and took off his helmet. He was bright blue. Allcock gave him mouth-to-mouth, a couple of big puffs … and miraculously, he came round. Lemons doesn’t remember it, but there’s a lovely moment of footage where Yuasa reaches out and holds Lemons, who reaches out and grabs on to him and Allcock. “They’re the real heroes in this story,” Lemons says, “and everyone on the boat. I’m just a damsel in distress.”\n\nHow Lemons survived – and without brain damage – for more than 25 minutes is something of a mystery. He has been to medical conferences and spoken to many experts in his search for answers, but the professionals are as perplexed as he is. He thought it was the cold that had saved him, since there are stories of people falling through ice and surviving for a long time. “But I’ve learned that if my body had been so cold that I’d gone into some kind of hibernation or stasis, there is no way Duncan would have been able to resuscitate me that quickly.”\n\nHe still thinks the cold was a factor. And that, because of the pressure, his tissue was saturated with oxygen. He’s also been told that a buildup of CO 2 in the blood – hypercapnia – can be neurologically protective. If medical tests had been performed on him immediately after he was rescued, he might have the empirical data that could provide answers; but he had to remain locked away in a pressurised chamber after he arrived back in Aberdeen.\n\nSomehow, he was fine afterwards – physically and mentally. And three weeks, later he was saturation diving again, back on the seabed in exactly the same spot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Finn Cole, Alex Parkinson, Woody Harrelson, Duncan Allcock, Dave Yuasa, Chris Lemons and Simu Liu at the New York premiere of Last Breath. Photograph: Kristina Bumphrey/Variety/Getty Images\n\nLemons and his fiancee got married and finished building their house. They’re no longer together but he has a new partner, and two kids – the hopes and dreams he had weren’t lost at the bottom of the North Sea. The enormity of what he had been through took a while to sink in. It has given him a more acute awareness of mortality, and of the preciousness and fragility of life. But it’s also underlined the power of human resilience. “We sometimes underestimate what we’re capable of. It’s given me courage and confidence, rather than knocked it out of me.”\n\nLemons still works in the industry, but as a diving supervisor on the ship, not on the seabed. He is also dialling down the day job and doing more public speaking. It’s funny that by knocking so loudly on death’s door, he has ended up opening a load of others.\n\nAnd now his story’s being told in a thriller, also called Last Breath, directed by Alex Parkinson. Allcock, from Chesterfield, is played by Woody Harrelson, from Texas. Simu Liu, who played one of the Kens in the Barbie movie, plays Yuasa. And Lemons? Finn Cole, from Peaky Blinders. “Lush head of hair, good-looking lad – makes complete sense,” says Lemons, who is – and was at the time – bald.\n\nRight, the taxi’s waiting. He’s got to go to the airport. A proper taxi, on dry land. Lemons, Allcock and Yuasa are off to New York, for the premiere of Last Breath.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Unless it becomes a ratings smash (and that isn’t impossible), With Love, Meghan doesn’t just represent the hard launch of Duchess of Sussex’s new career as a Martha Stewart-style lifestyle inspo guru; it might also be the final thing she makes for Netflix.\n\nThe terms of the deal Harry and Meghan signed with the streamer in 2021 were, by all accounts, wildly favourable. Their five-year deal was worth $100m, in the expectation that they would be so brimming with ideas that they would become Obama-style prestige-content producers. Reader, as you already know, this did not happen.\n\nInstead With Love, Meghan is the fourth project to be released under Prince Harry and Meghan’s Archewell banner – and the third consecutive disappointment. Last year’s documentary series Polo – an F1: Drive to Survive rip-off that asked the question “Are polo players as dull as they seem?” then immediately fell asleep – all but died on impact. This was due to a combination of factors, primarily the on-screen absence of Harry and the pointlessness of polo.\n\nPrior to that, there was 2023’s documentary Heart of Invictus, which also had limited appeal. Outside the Netflix deal, there was Meghan’s bizarre podcast cul-de-sac, Archetypes, which ran for 12 episodes in 2022 and was the sum total of the couple’s $20m Spotify deal.\n\nIn truth, With Love, Meghan probably won’t turn things around either, unless the broader public suddenly develops a hankering for long-form television programmes about a woman filling children’s party bags with seeds and manuka honey. This means that the only successful content produced by Harry and Meghan so far has been, well, Harry & Meghan.\n\nThis one you will definitely remember, because it was the reality show that came amid 2022’s post-Megxit Burn It All Down tour, where it felt as if every one of their waking moments was dedicated to lashing out at their families in full view of the public. There was the Oprah interview in which Meghan said that one (and only one) member of the royal family was racist. There was Spare, the book in which Harry detailed all his fights with his brother, plus the time he took so many drugs at Courteney Cox’s house that he ended up having a conversation with a bin.\n\nView image in fullscreen Nobody wants to see these two make decorative ladybird crostini … the Duchess of Sussex with Mindy Kaling in With Love, Meghan. Photograph: Justin Coit/Netflix\n\nBut Harry & Meghan now feels like the pinnacle of all that because, unlike everything else, it understood what audiences expected of them. Yes, it had ambition – parts of the series did a really good job of contextualising the royal family’s history of colonialism – that elevated their complaints from whining. But, more importantly, there was also a lot of whining.\n\nA lot of whining. It was basically all they did for the entire series. And, honestly, they were great at it. Harry & Meghan would have made an amazing 00s VH1 reality show, full of bitchy asides to camera and gratuitous sound effects. There was an unignorable trashiness at its core, an opportunistic desperation for attention that couldn’t be quenched. Had they been smarter about drip-releasing their grievances, rather than unleashing them all at once, Harry & Meghan may well have run for years.\n\nThe thirsty part of Meghan still exists. It’s evident in the Vanity Fair story about her going to a publisher to pitch a book about divorce, despite not actually being divorced yet. And it’s evident in her decision to rebrand herself in With Love, Meghan. The problem is that nobody wants to see Meghan making decorative ladybird crostini with Mindy Kaling. With Love, Meghan is the sort of gormless lifestyle filler that, had it been made by the BBC, would be used to bulk out episodes of Saturday Kitchen.\n\nThere is a version of Meghan that people want to see on screen. But it isn’t the joylessly joy-filled rictus version of With Love, Meghan. No, they want to see the furious, righteous Meghan from Harry & Meghan. In other words, what they want is a proper Meghan reality show.\n\nThere are rumours that Netflix may not cut its losses with the Sussexes completely, instead preferring to keep them on at a vastly reduced rate. This is good news for the content developed but not yet delivered, such as the adaptation of the novel Meet Me at the Lake, and possibly even their aborted animation show, Pearl. But mainly it’s good news for us. If this really is the last roll of the dice, then it may be time for Harry and Meghan to face the inevitable and become the new Osbournes.",

        "content": "China and Canada have announced retaliatory measures against the US after Donald Trump imposed his sweeping tariffs plan, despite warnings it could spark an escalating trade war.\n\nUS tariffs of 25% have come into force against goods from Canada and Mexico, the US’s two biggest trading partners, and 20% tariffs against Chinese goods – doubling the levy on China from last month.\n\nThe duties will affect more than $918bn (£722bn) worth of US imports from Canada and Mexico.\n\nChina said on Tuesday it would impose fresh tariffs on a range of agricultural imports from the US next week.\n\nIts finance ministry said additional 15% tariffs would be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton, with further 10% tariffs on sorghum, soya beans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. It has also raised additional complaints against the US with the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on C$30bn (£16.3bn) worth of US imports. He said previously that Canada would target US beer, wine, bourbon, home appliances and Florida orange juice.\n\nTariffs will be placed on another C$125bn (£68bn) of US goods if Trump’s tariffs are still in place in 21 days. “Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,” Trudeau said, adding that they would violate the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement signed by Trump during his first term.\n\nMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said on Tuesday that there was no justification for Trump’s tariffs and said her government would respond with tariff and non-tariff measures.\n\nAsian markets were down – after sharp falls in US markets on Monday – as Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2%, Taiwan’s benchmark TWII index was off 0.5% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.3%.\n\nThe Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell to their lowest levels in a month on Tuesday. The US dollar index, which tracks the currency against six peers, fell to a three-month low, down 0.75%.\n\nIn Europe, the FTSE 100 dropped by 81 points, or 0.8%, a day after rising to more than 8,900 points for the first time. Germany’s Dax and Spain’s Ibex indices fell more than 2%, while France’s Cac 40 was off almost 2%.\n\nTrump and his allies claim that higher tariffs on US imports from across the world will help “make America great again” by enabling it to obtain political and economic concessions from allies and rivals on the global stage.\n\nBusinesses, inside the US and worldwide, have warned of widespread disruption if the Trump administration pushes ahead with this strategy.\n\nSince winning November’s presidential election, Trump has focused on China, Canada and Mexico, threatening the three markets with steep duties on their exports unless they reduced the “unacceptable” levels of illegal drugs crossing into the US.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has pledged to bring down prices in the US, but economists have warned that consumers in the country could be adversely affected by his trade plans.\n\nA 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico and a 10% levy on China amounts to “the largest tax increase in at least a generation”, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a thinktank that estimated the move would cost the typical US household more than $1,200 each year.\n\nTrump has vowed to go further, threatening to introduce “reciprocal” tariffs on countries that have their own duties on goods made in the US. He has said these will come into effect as soon as next month.\n\nThe US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, claimed that Chinese manufacturers would swallow the US tariffs. He said on Tuesday: “China’s business model is export, export, export, and that’s unacceptable. I am highly confident that the Chinese manufacturers will eat the tariffs; prices won’t go up.”\n\nTrump has said the tariffs on China are because the government has failed to stop illicit fentanyl entering the US, which Beijing says is a “pretext” to threaten China.\n\n“China opposes this move and will do what is necessary to firmly safeguard its legitimate interests,” a foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said. “If the United States … persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end.”\n\nChina’s finance ministry said: “The US’s unilateral tariff increase damages the multilateral trading system, increases the burden on US companies and consumers, and undermines the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”\n\nThe ministry said products shipped from the US to China that departed before 10 March and arrived before 12 April would not be subject to the tariffs.",

        "title": "Trump orders swathes of US forests to be cut down for timber",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has ordered that swathes of America’s forests be felled for timber, evading rules to protect endangered species while doing so and raising the prospect of chainsaws razing some of the most ecologically important trees in the US.\n\nThe president, in an executive order, has demanded an expansion in tree cutting across 280m acres (113m hectares) of national forests and other public lands, claiming that “heavy-handed federal policies” have made America reliant on foreign imports of timber.\n\n“It is vital that we reverse these policies and increase domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security,” the order adds.\n\nTrump has instructed the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to increase logging targets and for officials to circumvent the US’s Endangered Species Act by using unspecified emergency powers to ignore protections placed upon vulnerable creatures’ habitats.\n\nThis move is similar to recent instructions by Trump to use a rarely-used committee to push through fossil fuel projects even if they imperil at-risk species. Experts have said this overriding of the Endangered Species Act is probably illegal.\n\nThe order also stipulates logging projects can be sped up if they are for purported wildfire risk reduction, via “thinning” of vegetation that could ignite. Some scientists have said that aggressively felling forests, particularly established, fire-resistant trees, actually increases the risk of fast-moving fires.\n\n“This Trump executive order is the most blatant attempt in American history by a president to hand over federal public lands to the logging industry,” said Chad Hanson, wildfire scientist at the John Muir Project.\n\n“What’s worse, the executive order is built on a lie, as Trump falsely claims that more logging will curb wildfires and protect communities, while the overwhelming weight of evidence shows exactly the opposite.”\n\nHanson said logging alters the microclimate of forests, creating hotter and drier conditions that helps wildfires, such as the events that recently ravaged Los Angeles, to spread faster.\n\n“Trump’s exact approach, logging in remote forests and telling communities that it will stop fires, is responsible for numerous towns being destroyed by fires in recent years, and hundreds of lives lost,” he said.\n\nEnvironmental groups decried Trump’s latest attempt to circumvent endangered species laws that shield about 400 species in national forests, including grizzly bears, spotted owls and wild salmon, and warned an increase in logging could pollute the water supply relied upon by millions of Americans.\n\n“Trump’s order will unleash the chainsaws and bulldozers on our federal forests. Clearcutting these beautiful places will increase fire risk, drive species to extinction, pollute our rivers and streams, and destroy world-class recreation sites,” said Randi Spivak public lands policy director for the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n“This is a particularly horrific move by Trump to loot our public lands by handing the keys to big business.”\n\nThe future of some of America’s most prized forests now appears uncertain. Under Joe Biden, the US committed to protecting the last fragments of old-growth forest, which contain some of the grandest and oldest trees on Earth. As trees soak up planet-heating carbon dioxide, protecting the oldest, most carbon-rich trees is seen as a way to help address the climate crisis. The former president also vowed to end deforestation by 2030.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Biden, under pressure from Republicans and the timber industry, halted the old-growth protection plan in January and Trump officially killed off the executive order in his first day back in the White House.\n\nTrump’s shift towards a more industry-friendly stance has been underlined by his choice of a lumber executive lead the Forest Service, which has just fired 2,000 workers amid a purge led by Elon Musk, who has also been recently seen wielding a chainsaw.\n\nTom Schultz, previously a vice-president of Idaho Forest Group, which sells wood, will be the next Forest Service chief, overseeing the management of 154 national forests and 193m acres of land, an area roughly the size of Texas.\n\n“Working with our partners, we will actively manage national forests and grasslands, increase opportunities for outdoor recreation, and suppress wildfires with all available resources emphasizing safety and the importance of protecting resource values,” Schultz said in a statement.\n\nGreen groups criticized the choice of Schultz. “Naming a corporate lobbyist to run the agency tasked with overseeing the last old growth left in the US makes it clear that the Trump administration’s goal isn’t to preserve our national forests, but to sell them off to billionaires and corporate polluters,” said Anna Medema, associate director of legislative and administrative advocacy for forests and public lands at the Sierra Club.\n\nSchultz replaces Randy Moore, a soil scientist who was the first black person to lead the Forest Service. In a departing note to staff ahead of his retirement, Moore wrote that the recent loss of staff from the agency had been “incredibly difficult”.\n\n“If you are feeling uncertainty, frustration, or loss, you are not alone,” Moore wrote. “These are real and valid emotions that I am feeling, too. Please take care of yourselves and each other.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "1. Meghan really, really wants us to like her “Please Love Me, Love Meghan” may have been a more accurate title. Her hunger to be liked by a world that has decided to find her annoying is genuinely poignant. She really wants you to know what an amazing time you would have if you came to her house to hang out – not that she’s letting us see inside her actual house, but never mind. Her love language is mostly crudites – this strikes me as where she may be going wrong, but maybe it lands better in California? Her friend Mindy Kaling seems nice. (“Next time, you come to my kitchen and I’ll show you how to microwave burritos.”) Also, her beekeeper Brendan, who appears to have wandered off the set off Dude, Where’s My Car?, is adorable, so maybe she should be besties with him?\n\n2. The elevator pitch could have been ‘Meet the influencer love child of Marie-Antoinette and Martha Stewart’ View image in fullscreen Not all that helpful as life hacks go … the Duchess of Sussex ‘harvests honey’ in With love, Meghan. Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix With Love, Meghan is quite confusing as a show because it is all about the charming joyful family home Meghan has created for her family, but it’s not in her home – it was filmed in another mansion nearby – and her family aren’t in it. She makes oblique poetic allusions to them: it is very important to make your own jam because then your kids will associate sweet cooking smells with home, apparently. It’s a bit surreal. Do you remember when Kanye West and Julia Fox announced they were a couple by doing a date-night-themed fashion shoot in Interview magazine? It’s a bit like that. The “How to harvest honey” section turns out to be: wear a pristine beekeeping outfit, stand well back and watch your beekeeper harvest honey, which is perhaps not all that helpful as life hacks go.\n\n3. Being a super-chill Californian homebody does not look very relaxing Meghan has the phrase “I’m just winging it” chalked on a blackboard in the kitchen in elegant calligraphy, which is definitely a totally normal thing that someone super laid-back would have. I can’t help feeling she overthinks the concept of “having people over”. When her friend Daniel comes to stay, she prepares her own epsom salts for the bathroom in the guest cottage, tied in individual silk bags. I think she is aiming for Gwyneth Paltrow but it ends up more Rowan Atkinson in Love Actually. Waiting for another guest, she actually says: “I need to impress this man, with my tidiness, with my kitchen savvy and my cleanliness,” which made me want to give her a hug. When her pal Delfi drops in, Meghan teaches her to make focaccia, takes her on a hike then sends her home with homemade biscuits for her dog. What happened to putting the kettle on and having a gossip at the kitchen table?\n\n4. England, what England? The Duke of Sussex likes bacon. That is all I can tell you about Harry, who has one cameo appearance but is notable mostly by his absence. With Love, Meghan marks a sharp diversion from the “true love conquers all” narrative of the Sussexes. This is quite literally the Meghan show. The ill-fated English years have been written out of history, like that disastrous holiday you once took with the in-laws that everyone has silently agreed never to speak of again. Instead, much is made of Meghan’s wrong-side-of-the-LA-tracks origin story, as a fast-food eating latchkey kid. She and Mindy have a laugh over a glass of bubbly about how her idiot British husband thinks a ladybug is called a ladybird. Come to think of it, she does like day drinking, so maybe England did rub off a tiny bit.",

        "content": "The shadow defence secretary and other MPs have reacted with fury after JD Vance appeared to describe a proposed Anglo-French peace deployment to Ukraine as “20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years”.\n\nIt comes after Downing Street said Keir Starmer had spoken to Donald Trump on Monday night, part of continued UK efforts to try to patch up a faltering peace plan for Ukraine.\n\nDuring an interview with the Fox News channel’s Hannity, Vance, the increasingly outspoken US vice-president, was scathing about the idea of other countries being able to give meaningful security guarantees after any peace deal.\n\n1:02 'Some random country': Vance appears to insult UK and France with Ukrainian taunt – video\n\nA proposed minerals agreement would give the US more economic interests in Ukraine and thus provide “a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years”, Vance said.\n\nWhile UK politicians are largely united in agreeing that a US military presence in some form will be necessary in any peace deal, there was immediate outrage about Vance’s apparent dismissal of a UK military that fought alongside American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nJames Cartlidge, the Conservative shadow defence secretary, said: “Britain and France came to their [the US’s] aid, deploying thousands of personnel to Afghanistan, including my own brother and numerous parliamentary colleagues, past and present. It’s deeply disrespectful to ignore such service and sacrifice.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance said it was “absurdly dishonest” to argue that he had been referring to the UK or France, despite the countries being at the forefront of efforts to provide a non-US peacekeeping force.\n\n“I don’t even mention the UK or France in the clip, both of whom have fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond,” he tweeted. “But let’s be direct: there are many countries who are volunteering (privately or publicly) support who have neither the battlefield experience nor the military equipment to do anything meaningful.”\n\nAsked about Vance’s initial comments, Starmer’s official spokesperson did not directly address them but reiterated the fact that UK forces had fought recently alongside their American counterparts.\n\n“The prime minister, and I think this whole country, is full of admiration for all British troops who have served, for instance, in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of whom have lost their lives in the process, and have fought alongside allies, including the United States,” he said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the prime minister had spoken to Trump twice over the weekend and had another talk with the US president on Monday night.\n\nIn contrast to Cartlidge, Kemi Badenoch declined to condemn Vance’s remarks. “I know JD Vance quite well,” the Conservative leader told GB News. “I’ve looked at the comments; I don’t think he actually said that. A lot of people are getting carried away.”\n\nNigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, who is close to Trump and Vance, was trenchant in his response, telling GB News: “JD Vance is wrong – wrong, wrong, wrong.” He added: “For 20 years in Afghanistan, pro rata our size against America’s, we spent the same amount of money; we put the same number of men and women in. We suffered the same losses.”\n\nJohnny Mercer, the Conservative former armed forces minister, who is no longer an MP, called Vance a “clown”.\n\nMercer, who served in Afghanistan as an army officer, said: “I read JD Vance’s book, making the mistake of finding him quite interesting. By his own admission he spent his time in the Marines ‘writing articles and taking pictures’. Perhaps if he had got his hands dirty serving his country like so many of his fellow American and British veterans, chasing his own country’s crazy foreign policy ideas, he might not be so quick to dismiss their sacrifice.”\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said Peter Mandelson, the UK ambassador to Washington, should seek an apology from Vance. The party’s defence spokesperson, Helen Maguire, who as a Royal Military Police officer served in Iraq, said: “I saw first-hand how American and British soldiers fought bravely together shoulder to shoulder. Six of my own regiment, the Royal Military Police, didn’t return home from Iraq. This is a sinister attempt to deny that reality.”",

Gambaryan didn’t know it yet, but the agent happened to be in Rome for a conference with Gambaryan’s old boss, the head of the IRS-CI cybercrime division, Jarod Koopman, both of whom wanted to bring him beer and pizza at his hotel.\n\nGambaryan told Ogunjobi he had to go, and he ended the call.\n\nAwards from Gambaryan's IRS career and a copy of remarks published in the Congressional Record by congressman Rich McCormick celebrating his return from Nigerian detention. Photograph: Piera Moore\n\nOn a cold and windy December day on Capitol Hill, former federal agents and prosecutors, State Department officials, and congressional aides mingle in a plush room in the Rayburn House Office Building. One by one, members of Congress come in and shake hands with Tigran Gambaryan, who’s wearing a dark blue suit and tie, his beard close-trimmed again and head cleanly shaved, limping only slightly from the emergency surgery on his spine that he underwent a month earlier in Georgia.\n\nGambaryan poses for photos and chats with each legislator, aide, and State Department official long enough to thank them for their role in getting him home. When French Hill says that it’s good to see him again, Gambaryan quips that he hopes he smells better than he did during their meeting in Kuje.\n\nThe reception is one in a series of VIP welcomes that Gambaryan has received on his return. At the airport in Georgia, Representative McCormick had come to greet him, and gave him an American flag that had flown above the Capitol building the previous day. The White House released a statement noting that President Biden had called the Nigerian president and “underscored his appreciation for President Tinubu’s leadership in securing the release on humanitarian grounds of American citizen and former U.S. law enforcement official Tigran Gambaryan.”\n\nThe statement of thanks, I later learned, was part of the deal the US government struck with Nigeria, which also included aiding in its investigation of Binance—which is still ongoing. Nigeria continues to prosecute both Binance and Anjarwalla in absentia. A Binance spokesperson wrote in a statement that the company is “relieved and grateful” that Gambaryan is home and expressed thanks to all who worked to secure his release. “We are eager to put this episode behind us and continue working toward a brighter future for the blockchain industry in Nigeria and around the world,” the statement adds. “We will continue to defend ourselves against spurious claims.” Nigerian government officials did not respond to WIRED's repeated requests for comment on Gambaryan's case.\n\nAfter the reception, Gambaryan and I get in a cab outside, and I ask him what’s next for him. He says that he may be getting back into government, if the new administration will have him—and if Yuki will put up with another move back to DC. (Crypto news site Coindesk reported last month that he’s been recommended by cryptocurrency industry insiders with connections to President Trump for roles as senior as head of crypto assets at the SEC or a high-level position in the FBI’s cyber division.) Before he considers anything like that, he says vaguely, “I probably need time to get my head straight.”\n\nGambaryan (right) with Congressman French Hill at a reception in his honor on Capitol Hill after his return to the US.\n\nI ask him how he feels the experience in Nigeria has changed him. “I guess it did make me angrier?” he responds in a strangely light tone, as if thinking about the question himself for the first time. “It made me want to get vengeance against those that did this.”\n\nRevenge for Gambaryan may be more than a fantasy. He’s pursuing a human rights lawsuit against the Nigerian government that began during his detention, and hopes there will be an investigation into the Nigerians who he argues held him hostage for the better part of a year of his life. At times, he says, he’s even sent messages to individual officials he holds responsible, telling them, “You’ll see me again,” that what they did “brought shame on the badge,” that he can forgive what they did to him, but not what they did to his family.\n\n“Was it stupid for me to do that? Probably,” he tells me in the cab. “I was on the floor with back pain and just bored.”\n\nAs we step out of the car at his hotel in Arlington and Gambaryan lights a cigarette, I tell him that despite his description of himself as angrier than before his time in prison, he actually seems calmer and happier to me than in years past—that when I was covering his serial takedowns of corrupt federal agents, crypto money launderers, and child abusers, he had always struck me as angry, driven, relentless in chasing the targets of his investigations.\n\nGambaryan responds that, if he seems more relaxed now, it’s only because he’s happy to be home—grateful to see his family and his friends, to be able to walk again, to not be caught between forces so much larger than himself waging a conflict that had so little to do with him. To have not died in prison.\n\nAs for being driven by anger in the past, Gambaryan disagrees.\n\n“I'm not sure that was anger. That was justice,” he says. “I wanted justice. And I still do.”",

        "content": "Tushy has done a lot to raise awareness about bidets in the United States. I don't personally love their approach to marketing—potty puns aplenty and a T-shirt that reads “Ask Me About My Butthole”—but as the keeper of our guide to the best bidets, and as a long-time advocate for bidets, I have to respect the hustle.\n\nI also haven't been especially impressed by Tushy's products. The company's flagship is a simple, cheap bidet that attaches under a standard toilet seat to clean using cold water. You can adjust the angle of the spray with a small switch and adjust the power of the spray with a knob. They run about $100, and there's no power required, meaning they're a nice entry point to the world of bidet attachments for an American audience still mostly unfamiliar with the devices. However, they're no replacement for a modern bidet seat with heated water, night lights, UV sanitization, and fully adjustable spray settings.\n\nPhotograph: Tushy\n\nThe new Aura is Tushy's attempt to set up to the likes of Toto and Kohler with a full-function powered bidet attachment. At $600, it's priced like its competition. After a week of testing, I can say it does a good job of keeping pace.\n\nPlumber’s Track\n\nFor anyone still unfamiliar with how bidet seat attachments work, it's worth a quick explanation. Every bidet attachment I've tested—more than a dozen now—works by adding a splitter to the hose that connects the water spigot on the wall of your bathroom which runs to the bottom of the toilet tank.\n\nTo install you turn the spigot off, flush the toilet to empty the tank, screw on the splitter, and then connect one side of the splitter to the toilet tank and the other to the bidet attachment. Instead of the water only refilling the toilet tank, some will flow into the seat, where it's used to spray your bottom off after you use the restroom. These devices only take about 20 minutes to install if everything goes smoothly (if your toilet tank is less than 6 inches from the wall, I highly recommend this $20 attachment to ease installation), and the bidet helps you feel fresh after every trip to the restroom.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "It’s dangerous to have epiphanies while shaving. But in this case it was unavoidable: My epiphany was about shaving.\n\nFor the past few weeks, my bathroom routine has been a little like George Clooney in O Brother, Where Art Thou?, minus the smelly Dapper Dan. I’ve been lathering shave soap with a brush and bowl, and shaving with an old-fashioned single-blade, single-edge, unmedicated safety razor.\n\nSpecifically, I’m using the Leaf Thorn—a stylish and well-marketed and self-avowedly “aggressive” single-edge razor whose house blades are so wafer-thin the company imprints them with the words “I am not plastic.” The less aggressive Leaf Single Edge Razor is called the Twig, and it's meant to be more gentle than the Thorn. It’s all very cute.\n\nBut what I learned, after weeks of baby-smooth shaves with the Thorn, is that I’ve been doing shaving wrong.\n\nStay Sharp\n\nThe epiphany was something that seems obvious at first: The best and safest blade is always the sharp one. The best kitchen knife is the one you keep sharp. The same goes for scissors, and for the blades you put on your own face. The Leaf’s low-tech, simple single-blade was cutting as closely and well as any fancy cartridge blade setup I’ve tried on the market. The reason was mostly that it was still sharp.\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nBecause here’s the thing: It doesn’t matter if you’ve got a 15-layer stacked blade cartridge with whistles, lights, and responsive AI. Dull blades are awful, and all blades get dull with use. And when blades get dull, they start to yank on my hair instead of cutting it, irritate my skin into aggravation, and cause little nicks when the skin pinches up. Alas, the modern cartridge-based shaving blades that dominate the supermarket are expensive and often inconvenient to constantly replace: around $30 or $40 for a pack of 10.\n\nThe price adds up. Time magazine knew this game already in 1927: \"As everyone knows, safety razor manufacturers derive the bulk of their profit, not from razors, but from the replaceable blades.\"' The old business school yarn that King Camp Gillette devised a get-rich scheme to lose money on safety razor handles to make money on the blades is a bit of a myth, but the business logic of shaving remains inexorable: The money’s in the blades.\n\nSo I resist swapping out for too long. And then pay the price. Even as Gillette and other razor makers advertise that their blade cartridges are good for weeks’ worth of shaves, my own coarse, evil, steel-clad stubble tends to eat through a cartridge a whole lot sooner than I want to replace it. So either I keep paying blade installments, or pay my tax in the form of a no good, very bad shave.\n\nThe Safety Dance\n\nThe Leaf offers an opposing theory of shaving: The money’s in the handle. The blades are instead cheap, small, and ubiquitous. The Thorn is at heart an old-fashioned safety razor. It’s compatible with pretty much any good old-fashioned safety blade, whether the classic Astra Platinum (you’ll have to snap the double edge in half) or Leaf’s own blades. Packs of a hundred are less than a $20 bill.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The plea for help arrived last summer. “I am in Myanmar and work for a fraud company,” a Chinese human-trafficking victim wrote in a short email sent from within the Tai Chang scam compound. Like thousands of others in the region, they were promised legitimate work only to find themselves tricked into modern slavery and forced to scam people online for hours every day. Tai Chang, which backs on to the Myanmar-Thailand border, has been linked to incidents of torture. “I’m not safe, I’m chatting with you secretly,” they said. Despite the risk, their first request wasn’t to be rescued.\n\nTai Chang’s internet connection had recently been cut off from Thailand, the person wrote in the messages to anti-scam group GASO in June 2024. Instead of scamming within the compound grinding to a halt, the organized criminals behind the operation found another way to stay online, they claimed. “Elon Musk’s Starlink is installed above all the buildings in the campus where we are now,” the individual wrote. “Now the fraud work is running normally. If the fraud network here is down, we can regain our freedom.”\n\nThose messages soon landed on the desk of Erin West, then deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County, California. West, a longtime advocate for victims of so-called pig butchering and other types of cryptocurrency scams, wrote to a lawyer at SpaceX, the company behind Musk’s high-speed Starlink satellite internet system. Starlink connections appeared to be helping criminals at Tai Chang to “scam Americans” and “fuel their internet needs,” West alleged at the end of July 2024. She offered to share more information to help the company in “disrupting the work of bad actors.”\n\nSpaceX and Starlink never replied, West claims.\n\nReports of the use of Starlink at Tai Chang are not a one-off—criminals running multibillion-dollar empires across Southeast Asia appear to be widely using the satellite internet network. At least eight scam compounds based around the Myanmar-Thailand border region are using Starlink devices, according to mobile phone connection data reviewed by WIRED. Between November 2024 and the start of February, hundreds of mobile phones logged their locations and use of Starlink at known scam compounds more than 40,000 times, according to the mobile phone data, which was collected by an online advertising industry tool.\n\nThe eight compounds, spread around the Myawaddy region of war-torn Myanmar, likely have installed multiple Starlink devices. Photos of Tai Chang reviewed by WIRED appear to show dozens of white Starlink satellite dishes on a single rooftop, while human rights watchdogs and other experts say that Starlink use at the scam compounds has increased in the past year.\n\n“I believe that SpaceX must have the capacity to stop this problem,” says Rangsiman Rome, an opposition member of the House of Representatives in Thailand who chairs a parliamentary committee on national security and border issues. At the start of February, Rome tagged Musk in a post on X, saying criminals are “exploiting Starlink for massive fraud” at scam compounds in the region. He did not get a reply, he says.",

In the camera app, you may see some stutters or shutter lag, and that's the only area where I felt that this phone was equipped with a midrange processor. In all other respects, it feels just as powerful as a flagship, though intensive games like Genshin Impact may not offer the highest graphics fidelity.\n\nI'm glad to see Nothing stuff 256 GB of storage in here—it's high time phone manufacturers started making this the default. Nothing has also beefed up the software update policy with three Android OS updates and 6 years of security updates, which is respectable, though Samsung is promising 6 years total for both on its new Galaxy A series phones. Nothing will argue that Samsung is a megacorp while it is a lowly startup. Fair. I'm just glad to see these companies increasing software support every year.\n\nSpecs: Nothing Phone (3a) Nothing Phone (3a) Pro Display: 6.77 inch, AMOLED LTPS, 30-120 Hz, 3,000 nits (peak) 6.77 inch, AMOLED LTPS, 30-120 Hz, 3,000 nits (peak) Processor and RAM: Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 with 12 GB of RAM Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 with 12 GB of RAM Storage: 256 GB 256 GB Cameras: 50-MP main, 8-MP ultrawide, 50-MP telephoto (2X optical), 32-MP selfie camera 50-MP main, 8-MP ultrawide, 50-MP telephoto (3X optical), 50-MP selfie camera Battery: 5,000 mAh 5,000 mAh Extra features: 50-watt fast charging, IP64, NFC 50-watt fast charging, IP64, NFC Carrier support: Works on T-Mobile. 4G works on AT&T and Verizon, but you need to contact the carriers to whitelist the device for 5G Works on T-Mobile. 4G works on AT&T and Verizon, but you need to contact the carriers to whitelist the device for 5G Colors: Black and White Grey and Black Price: $379 $459\n\nMy only complaints are the lack of an IP68 rating and wireless charging. Motorola just debuted its budget Moto G Power of 2025 a few weeks ago, and it sports an IP68 rating for the first time, not to mention it can wirelessly charge. The IP64 rating on the Nothing phones means they will be fine in the rain, but you can't submerge them underwater, so be careful around the pool. It's hard to ding the company too harshly for wireless charging as it's still not too common on sub-$500 phones, but that certainly seems to be changing. Something to consider for the Phone (4a).\n\nThe Glyph lights remain on the back. I still like these LEDs—they can light up to music, notifications, show the remaining time left on a timer, and more. Do I find them tremendously useful? No, but they're a fun touch that add a bit of levity. It's a conversation starter.\n\nThoughtful AI Touches\n\nThere is a new button on the Phone (3a) series: the Essential Key. (Of no relation to the infamous Essential Phone.) Tap it once, and it will capture your screen and let you add a voice or text note to it. This will be analyzed in the Essential Space app via artificial intelligence, extracting any useful information out of the screenshot. It's similar to Google's Pixel Screenshots app, except you can infuse your notes. You can also press and hold the button to record a voice note—these are analyzed and stored as memories, so you can come back to them later. If it detects you wanted to act on something, it'll generate a task. A double-tap of the button opens the Essential Space app.\n\nCompared to how every other smartphone maker seems to be shoving the same generic AI features down our throats—AI transcribing! Writing tools! Summaries!—Nothing's approach here is at least different. Initially, it took me some time to start using the feature. I ended up accidentally pressing the button a few too many times because it's close to the power button (a textured button would've been smart). But now I'm slowly starting to press it down and record a quick voice note of something I want to remember or accomplish later on.\n\nThe Essential Key sits right below the power button. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu There's also a new Essential Space widget. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThese memories are transcribed, summarized, with tasks created on my behalf if that's what I wanted. I can also play my audio clip and hear myself directly. This is paired with an Essential Space widget, which is crucial in reminding me about these tasks and memories.\n\nThis is Nothing's first real AI rodeo, and I had some qualms about the security and privacy of all these personal notes I'm creating, so here are some answers: Nothing says most of the data in Essential Space is stored on your device, like the audio data that's converted to text. For the text and screenshot processing, this data is sent to Nothing's servers (in France for global users, India for Indian users) and subsequently deleted. Some other data is also uploaded to “improve processing accuracy,” like time, time zone, and location data, though this isn't stored. Nothing says this data is not used for advertising and is not shared with third parties “beyond the scope of the service request.” That last bit refers to the third-party companies Nothing works with to enable Nothing AI's functionality, though the company declined to share exactly who its partners are.",

        "title": "How Candise Lin Became the Unofficial Ambassador of Chinese Internet Culture",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "One day in mid-January, California-based social media influencer Candise Lin woke up and found that hundreds of thousands of so-called TikTok refugees were suddenly flocking to Red Note, a Chinese social media app she uses every day. Lin doesn’t want to claim the whole thing happened because of her, but the trend is a good example of how her videos have become an essential link connecting the parallel worlds of Western and Chinese social media. For many people who don’t otherwise know much about China, Lin has become the country’s de facto ambassador of internet culture.\n\nStarting in December 2023, Lin, who has more than 2.3 million combined followers on TikTok and Instagram, uploaded a series of viral videos introducing Red Note (known as Xiaohongshu in Chinese) to Western audiences as a destination for people searching for brutally honest makeover suggestions. The videos prompted beauty influencers to begin downloading the app, resulting in its first traffic bump from non-Chinese speakers. When TikTok was close to being banned in the US in January, it was beauty creators who suggested people should move to Red Note instead.\n\nBut long before Red Note offered millions of Americans an opportunity to directly experience the Chinese internet, Lin had been providing them a rare glimpse into it. “Dr. Lin’s content is like a magical portal to the other side of the world, where everyone is just like you but a little different,” says Lucy White, a 22-year-old Scottish bartender who follows Lin on Instagram.\n\nIn return, Lin has become a minor celebrity and earns a stable income from TikTok that subsidizes her day job as a Cantonese tutor. But her online presence also opens her up to controversies and hatred from both pro- and anti-China voices online. “If I say something nice about China, I’m called a CCP bot, but if I say something bad about China, I’m called a CIA spy,” Lin tells WIRED. As a result, she tries to stay clear of politics and focus on more innocuous and funny trends.\n\nEvery day, Lin scours the Chinese internet looking for a new celebrity feud, the hottest meme, or perhaps a viral college dorm challenge, which she then translates into English and explains in a minute-long video. Each clip features her giving the camera the same signature deadpan look. Lin is often asked why she doesn’t laugh in her videos, and she explains it’s because she needs to film four or five times to get the best take. No matter how funny the jokes are, they are getting old by the end of that. “That’s why I’m like a robot,” she says. Still, sometimes Lin can’t help but break into a smile, which delights her fans.\n\nLin’s audience loves learning about what hilarious things so-called Chinese “netizens” have been up to lately. Chinese social media is a world that Westerners don’t have access to because they don’t speak the same language or use the same platforms as people in China, says Josef Burton, a 39-year-old writer and former US diplomat who follows Lin on Instagram. “I can’t interact with it or reach it, but there is an ‘all men are brothers’ kind of fondness [in knowing] this ridiculous thing is going on online,” he says. “China is presented as this completely othered place where no one jokes around, this censored, barren hell space that’s all hyper propaganda … But no, people joke around. Daily life exists. Memes exist.”\n\nFun Facts about Cantonese\n\nCandise Lin was born in the Chinese city of Guangzhou and immigrated to the US with her family when she was in middle school. She received a doctorate degree in educational psychology and later worked as a postgraduate lecturer, and at one point tried opening an online skin care shop.\n\nThen the pandemic lockdowns hit, and while bored at home scrolling on her phone, Lin decided to start posting on TikTok. In April 2020, she made a 24-second video listing six English names that sound horrible in Cantonese: The name “Susan,” for example, sounds like “god of bad luck.” The video unexpectedly blew up, garnering 5 million views and over 10,000 comments. “So I kept making it into a series, and I realized there’s an audience for this,” Lin says.",

The newly dropped third season of Invincible finds Mark not only still struggling to escape his father's shadow, guiding his younger brother to use his own burgeoning powers responsibly, but also drowning in a world of murky politics, pushed toward darker, tougher choices to keep Earth safe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible’s more mature take on superheroes allows it to do something Marvel and DC characters rarely do: grow up.\n\nThe Man in the High Castle\n\nThis adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick’s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon’s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done—a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible—but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers.\n\nThe Rig\n\nBack for its second season, sci-fi thriller The Rig finds the surviving crew of isolated North Sea oil rig Kinloch Bravo forcibly relocated to The Stac, an even more remote facility in the Arctic. While most are desperate for answers and a way home, the team’s loyalties are tested as the sinister Pictor corporation seeks to use them to unearth something ancient and powerful from the sea floor. While The Rig doesn’t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to its ecological metaphors (one character even says, “If you keep punching holes in the Earth, eventually the Earth’s going to punch back”), it’s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic settings and the terrifying expanses and underwater pressures of the ocean. With the material elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, including Iain Glen and Rochenda Sandall—and bolstered further by the addition of the always-watchable Alice Krige in season 2—The Rig is far more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be.\n\nCross\n\nAldis Hodge steps into the shoes of Washington, DC homicide detective Alex Cross in Prime's new series based on James Patterson's long-running series of crime novels. However, unlike the streamer's other thrillers Bosch and Reacher, Cross doesn't directly adapt any of Patterson's books—a risky move, but one that largely pays off, allowing this eight-episode first season to chart an unpredictable journey as Cross faces off against a twisted murderer who models each of his kills on another serial killer. Already renewed for a second season, Cross is a strong addition to Prime's roster of crime dramas.\n\nCitadel: Diana\n\nAmazon tried to make a splash with its $300 million spy thriller Citadel in 2023, but only half-succeeded. The Richard Madden- and Priyanka Chopra-starring action series was entertaining enough—and rode high on Prime Video’s most-watched lists—but didn’t exactly set the world alight. However, it did establish a sprawling shared universe, with rival organizations Citadel and Manticore engaged in a globe-spanning cold war setting the stage for international spin-offs. Citadel: Diana is the first, an Italian outing focusing on Diana (Matilda De Angelis), a woman out for revenge after her parents are killed, and drawn into the spy-fi underworld with violent results. Gorgeous location shoots, bone-crunching fight choreography, and, most importantly, a tighter focus help Diana improve on its parent series.\n\nThe Legend of Vox Machina\n\nBawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina follows the eponymous adventurers' guild—consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard—as they grow from a motley crew of usually-drunk mercenaries into unexpected heroes for the realm of Exandria. The newly arrived third season continues the team's battle against the Chroma Conclave, a horrifyingly powerful collective of dragons. It's a quest that sends them on a small diversion to Hell itself. Adapting the hit Critical Role—the livestreamed Dungeons & Dragons sessions of some of the biggest voice actors in animation and gaming—this exquisitely animated fantasy takes things in unexpected directions that keep things fresh for new or returning viewers alike. A love letter to D&D that's also unafraid to poke fun at the classic RPG, it's one of the most original adult animated shows on Prime.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n\nTapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien’s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien’s Second Age. While the first season was a slow burn, dwelling on the fractious politics of the era, the second ratchets up the pace considerably. From Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) trying to prevent the ascension of Dark Lord Sauron (Charlie Vickers) to the long-awaited introduction of fan-favorite character Tom Bombadil (Rory Kinnear), the new season feels far richer and deeper than before. It remains a feast for the eyes too, with the stratospheric budget apparent in every frame, from quiet moments in luxuriant shires to cinematic battles between armies of Orcs and Elves. For sheer high fantasy spectacle, there’s little else to rival this streaming right now.\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader\n\nThe first new solo Batman animated series in a decade, Caped Crusader harkens back to Batman: The Animated Series from the 1990s, with showrunner Bruce Timm returning to the Dark Knight and Hamish Linklater voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman in an ode to the late, great Kevin Conroy. Unlike rival ‘90s revival X-Men ’97, though, this isn't a continuation but rather a wholly distinct take allowing for fresh interpretations of the iconic hero’s rogues’ gallery and allies—look out for drastically different takes on the Penguin and Harley Quinn in particular. Leaning heavily into a 1930s aesthetic that evokes Batman’s earliest comic book origins, this manages to be nostalgic and provocative at once—a fantastic outing that takes DC's original urban vigilante back to his gritty pulp noir roots.\n\nThe Boys\n\nSuperheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism—the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys, adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they’re a reflection of humanity’s worst—greed and unrestrained power, marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his associates The Boys, gleefully dispatching “Supes” who’ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. Unfortunately, the newly dropped fourth season finds the team in disarray, fractured by Butcher’s own lies, right as the world needs them most. Arch-manipulator Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is close to the Oval Office, while the sadistic, psychotic Homelander (Antony Starr) is planning a superhuman uprising. Probably Amazon’s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag.\n\nFallout\n\nMaybe the end of the world is the secret sauce to making a great video game adaptation—between The Last of Us and now this spectacular interpretation of Bethesda's postapocalyptic RPG series, we're living in an unexpected golden era for the form. Yet unlike HBO's bleak but beautiful world, Fallout taps into the source material to craft an apocalypse with a very different feel, one dripping in cracked Americana, black comedy, razor-sharp social satire, and just a little bit of camp. Its greatest strength, though, lies in how it doesn’t directly adapt any one of the core Fallout games. Instead, it perfectly channels their tone and feel, focusing on a core trio—naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), born and raised in a subterranean vault; driven Maximus (Aaron Moten), a recruit in an army seeking technology from the old world; and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a centuries-old bounty hunter mutated into a nigh-immortal zombie when the bombs fell—to showcase just how brilliantly twisted this nuclear wasteland really is.\n\nThree-Body\n\nNo, you're not on the Netflix list—Prime Video has its own distinct adaptation of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem. This take, originally released for Chinese audiences back in 2023, faithfully adapts Liu's award-winning novel of humanity's first contact with an almost unknowable alien species and the impact that their impending arrival on Earth has on humanity. Hopping between time periods, a galactic mystery unfurls after nanotech specialist Wang Miao (Luyi Zhang) is called in by detective Shi Qiang (Hewei Yu) to investigate a global spate of suicides among scientists, with the ominous phrase \"Physics doesn't exist\" being the only link between the deaths. Although Three-Body is a bit softer than Netflix's 3 Body Problem when dealing with some aspects of the story—notably anything related to China's Cultural Revolution—a hearty 30-episode run allows for far more space to explore Liu's complex themes and vast roster of characters. The pacing may take some getting used to for viewers more accustomed to western TV, and it's subtitled-only, but this C-drama is out of this world.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith\n\nYou likely know the concept from the name alone—a married couple operate as undercover agents, blurring the lines between their personal and professional relationship. Unlike the 2005 Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, though, 2024's Mr. and Mrs. Smith does far more with the concept. Donald Glover (who cocreated this reboot) and Maya Erskine offer much more developed takes on the mysterious characters of “John” and “Jane” Smith over the course of this eight-episode series, exploring their true identities, why they signed up for their dangerous careers, and whether their growing feelings for each other are just part of the roles they're playing. It's all backed up with plenty of Mission: Impossible–style action, of course, but it’s the sparkling chemistry between the show's leads that will leave you thinking, “Brangelina who?”\n\nReacher\n\nAmazon has a way with action thrillers focused on military tough guys who answer to \"Jack R\"—see Jack Ryan, also making this guide—and this sharp adaptation of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels continues the trend. Alan Ritchson (Titans, Fast X) stars as Reacher, a former military policeman now drifting from town to town, trying to live a quiet life but unable to avoid conflict. Season one finds him accused of a murder he didn't commit, while the newly arrived second sees Reacher drawn into a vast conspiracy when someone starts picking off the members of his old army unit of special investigators. It’s pulpy at times, but bombastic action and surprisingly sharp dialog help it punch above its weight.\n\nThe Wheel of Time\n\nBased on Robert Jordan’s sprawling novel series—one so vast it makes Game of Thrones look concise—this is one of Amazon’s most ambitious, and expensive, series to date. The eight-episode first season follows Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), a powerful weaver of an ancient form of magic, as she gathers five unassuming young people, one of whom is destined to either save the world—or destroy it. The second season ups the stakes, with ancient evils returning and new terrors rising—right as the only ones who can stop them are scattered around the world. A visually stunning series that blends sumptuous location shoots with cinematic effects work, this is an epic fantasy that's improving with every episode.\n\nGen V\n\nSpinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys, Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with its twisted parent show, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and more The Hunger Games with superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions who uncovers dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for and some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, then allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure—the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright.\n\nJack Ryan\n\nThere's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative—and beyond—over four perfectly crafted seasons. The final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet, investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies—season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country; big yikes there—its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing.\n\nI'm a Virgo\n\nA surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley (Sorry to Bother You), I’m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public’s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie’s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video’s “Explore” tab, for Riley’s insight into each episode.\n\nTales From the Loop\n\nDespite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by “the Loop,” an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors—including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it’s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of Stålenhag’s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable.\n\nThe Devil’s Hour\n\nWhen Peter Capaldi, here playing mysterious criminal Gideon Shepherd, says “my perception of time is better than anyone’s,” it’s clear that The Devil’s Hour creator Tom Moran is having a little fourth-wall-breaking fun with his former Time Lord leading man. That’s about as close as this gritty six-part drama gets to Doctor Who, though. Instead, this is a mix of murder mystery and thriller, topped off with a dash of the supernatural. The focus is on Lucy (Jessica Raine), an over-burdened social worker with an increasingly distant and troubled young son. Lucy wakes at exactly 3:33 am every morning, plagued by horrific visions, and her nightmares draw her into the orbit of police detective Ravi Dhillon’s (Nikesh Patel) investigations of a bloody murder and a child’s abduction. As she tries to figure out how the two are entangled, Lucy comes face to face with Shepherd. Raine is a phenomenally commanding lead throughout, while Capaldi's sinister performance is one of the most chilling you’ll see on screen.\n\nThem\n\nThis horror anthology series, created by Little Marvin and executive-produced by Queen & Slim’s Lena Waithe, sets its first season in 1950s Los Angeles and follows the Emory family as they move into an all-white neighborhood. It all goes about as well as you might expect, with Livia (Deborah Ayorinde) soon penned into their new home by the Stepford-like housewives of the area who make her life a living hell, led by ringleader Betty (Alison Pill). Outside the home, husband Henry (Ashley Thomas) faces physical assaults and harassment at work. Ayorinde and Thomas are phenomenal throughout, brilliantly portraying the mental, physical, and emotional turmoil of living under relentless threat. While the show’s portrayal of the period is tense and horrifying in its own right, the layering of some truly unsettling supernatural threats make this a frequently terrifying watch.\n\nThe Underground Railroad\n\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It’s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad—the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South—and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents.\n\nFleabag\n\nYou’re not supposed to like Fleabag. She’s selfish, self-destructive, and morally bankrupt. Her family is loathsome, her lifestyle is ridiculous, and her job is a joke. Yet after watching this 12-episode series, we defy you not to love her a little. This magnificent sitcom about a Londoner (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) grappling with the death of her best friend has no filter: You’ll hear her thoughts on feminism, familial tension, love, and sodomy. The first time Waller-Bridge interrupts her own dialog to shoot a disarming, conspiratorial glance to the screen, you’re hooked. Season one is a smutty yet wonderful crescendo of self-destruction driven by a cast of characters that includes Fleabag’s intensely awkward sister Claire (Sian Clifford), her selfish and pretentious stepmother (Olivia Colman), and her clueless father (Bill Paterson). The second season cheerfully bounds into blasphemy as she grapples with inappropriate (and reciprocated) feelings for a Catholic priest (Andrew Scott). It’s shocking and immensely watchable—and one of the rare cases when a series truly is as good as people say.\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nWhat is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers’ career. With four seasons and a host of awards and nominations to its name, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is one of Amazon’s sharpest comedies.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Consequences of the United States rapidly slashing foreign aid are reverberating across the world, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an unidentified illness with Ebola-like symptoms has ravaged several villages. This sickness has killed over 60 people and sickened more than a thousand, and it is occurring at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Uganda, as well as increasing political violence within the DRC.\n\nExperts say that Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has stymied the response to this unidentified disease, delaying further investigations and containment efforts of additional disease outbreaks.\n\n“Medical staff along the Uganda–DRC border have been terminated. Soldiers are everywhere. The laboratory built to deal with zoonotic diseases with US funding is empty,” says Tim Allen, a London School of Economics professor and tropical-disease-control expert on the ground at the border of Uganda and the DRC.\n\nNidhi Bouri, the former deputy assistant administrator for global health at USAID during the Joe Biden administration who previously led disease preparedness and response efforts, says the aid cuts have created a gap in the on-the-ground response. “We don’t have the in-country presence,” she says. USAID previously provided key infrastructure and support for disease surveillance and prevention; it worked in tandem with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on complementary tasks, Bouri says. “Once a pathogen is identified, USAID was able to, historically, identify rapid ways to mitigate further spread.” By abruptly gutting USAID, the Donald Trump administration has created a vacuum that other agencies will struggle to completely fill.\n\nThe US State Department did not respond to requests for comment. “CDC is monitoring the situation closely and engaging with DRC officials on what support the agency can offer,” says Centers for Disease Control spokesperson Melissa Dibble.\n\nWhile the disease in the DRC is still officially unidentified, there are some conflicting theories emerging about its cause. The World Health Organization now suspects that the unidentified illness could in fact be a mass-poisoning incident rather than a virus, with contaminated water as a likely source. Or, if it is a virus, it may not be novel at all; last year in the DRC, an outbreak of an unknown illness was discovered to be respiratory infections combined with malaria. Local health officials, including experts at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hypothesize that this may be the case again.\n\nIn 2024, the United States Congress appropriated $795 million for malaria control, most of which was intended to serve sub-Saharan Africa, which weathers the bulk of global malaria infections. Nevertheless, DOGE directed the swift dismantling of the vast majority of this aid. “Halting the US programs that prevent and treat malaria will lead to outbreaks and an exponential increase in deaths,” Martin Edlund, CEO of the nonprofit Malaria No More, said in a statement. “New modeling shows that a year of disruptions would lead to nearly 15 million additional cases of malaria and 107,000 additional deaths.”",

        "title": "Trump’s FDA Cuts Are Putting Drug Development at Risk",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Budget and staffing cuts at the Food and Drug Administration orchestrated by President Donald Trump could prevent new drugs “from being developed, approved, or commercialized in a timely manner, or at all,” according to dozens of annual reports sent by pharmaceutical companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission in late February.\n\n“The Trump Administration has enacted several executive actions that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA's ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities,” says one filing from Xenon Pharmaceuticals, a company based in Canada that researches treatments for epilepsy. “If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA's ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively affected.”\n\nIn February, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency laid off hundreds of FDA employees, causing widespread panic about the status of grant applications, active clinical trials, and drug approvals. Just over a week later, it reinstated a handful of staffers who regulate the American food supply and review medical devices.\n\nThe move did little to quell concerns from various pharmaceutical companies, who worry that any disruption to the slow moving bureaucracy could cause the FDA to grind to a halt. Before new drugs can go to market, the FDA has to conduct regular inspections and reviews, a process that can take years. Many recent SEC filings say if the FDA stops this work, these drugs simply can’t be released.\n\nBiopharmaceutical company Rezolute, which develops treatments for a rare, congenital form of low blood sugar, says that DOGE’s mandate to “reduce expenditures” at agencies like the FDA would slow down their work, according to an SEC filing. The company adds, “Our business is dependent upon the FDA and the FDA's ability to timely respond to our drug development activities.”\n\nSome pharmaceutical companies mentioned DOGE’s work at the National Institutes of Health, which provides tens of billions of dollars for drug research and development to corporations and universities around the world.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at carolinehaskins.61.\n\nClover Health, a health care company that provides Medicare, said in a recent filing that DOGE is creating “pressures on and uncertainty” around the federal budget, including the debt ceiling, which it claims “may negatively impact the economic environment, curtail spending on health and health care related matters.”\n\nSome filings also warned about the possibility that Trump will overhaul existing drug regulations, which would cost additional time and money to comply with. A recent Trump executive order mandates broad deregulation across federal agencies, and new Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed agreement and proposed his own budget cuts.\n\nDOGE recently froze $1.5 billion in funding for medical research, then later unfroze some of the funds. The back-and-forth left companies unclear on whether they can ultimately expect the US government to back their research. iBio, a company based in San Diego that studies antibody treatments for obesity and cardio-metabolic disorders, said in a filing that it’s currently “unclear” how Trump’s health care policy will affect grant funding for research in its field.",

        "title": "A Case for Turning Tulsa Into the Next Big Tech Hub",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Split in two by a highway—as communities of color often are—the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, was once known as America’s Black Wall Street. At the start of the 20th century, Greenwood was home to one of America’s most affluent Black communities, including a notable density of doctors, lawyers, bankers, and entrepreneurs. I didn’t fully appreciate the neighborhood’s significance when I pulled up to the Greenwood Cultural Center during my first visit to Tulsa in January 2019. With its quiet streets and empty parking lots, Greenwood seemed like so many of the places I’d been to before. But small commemorative plaques on the sidewalks where businesses once stood hinted at an overlooked and extraordinary history.\n\nI was there because the George Kaiser Family Foundation had invited me to town to consider working with them on an economic development project. GKFF is a multibillion-dollar philanthropy that combats intergenerational poverty in Tulsa, making it one of the largest foundations in the United States dedicated to improving lives in a single city. At the time, I was living in Manhattan and leading the cornerstone of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s jobs plan—Cyber NYC, an initiative of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. The New York Times called this public–private partnership “among the nation’s most ambitious cybersecurity initiatives,” and GKFF reached out to gauge my interest in helping Tulsa develop its own cyber ecosystem.\n\nMy trip happened to coincide with a visit by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. He was in Tulsa to award the Greenwood Cultural Center a million-dollar grant for a public arts project depicting the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre that destroyed Black Wall Street. I arrived before the event and wandered around the center, browsing the photographs and news clippings from the tragedy: a White mob attacked Black residents, burned down more than a thousand of their homes, and ruined nearly 200 businesses. I was horrified by the images of charred houses, dead bodies, smoke billowing in the air, land scorched and flattened, rubble drenched by fire hoses. The mob killed as many as 300 Black Tulsans, devastating what legendary sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois called the most “highly organized” Black community he’d ever seen. It was America’s worst episode of racist violence in the 20th century, and its impact lingers to this day.\n\nCourtesy of Harper Horizon Buy This Book at: Amazon\n\nBookshop.org\n\nBooks-a-Million If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nUnderstandably, the event at the center had a religious solemnity to it. There were prayers for the victims and moments of silence. Speakers reflected on all that was lost in 1921 and again during the period of urban renewal when, in the late 1960s and early ’70s, the community was torn apart for a second time by I-244, the highway that runs through Greenwood today. At the center, there were pleas for neighborhood investment, hope of revitalization, and murmurs about reparations. Speeches reminiscent of Sunday sermons joined with the political rhetoric of local elected officials, such as City Councilor Vanessa Hall-Harper and Mayor G. T. Bynum, who had just authorized a search for unmarked graves to determine the massacre’s total number of victims.\n\nJuxtaposed against these grim remarks were the flashing cameras, news media, and public excitement that accompany the presence of not just one but two of America’s wealthiest men. Mayor Bloomberg was joined that day by another billionaire, George Kaiser, a lifelong Tulsan and the founder of GKFF. The mix of Black trauma and White philanthropy created a peculiar vibe in the event space, at once somber and thrilling, mournful and hopeful. The dramatic tension in the air mesmerized me, and it caused me to wonder about how Black trauma is often portrayed as spectacle; how White philanthropists relate to the diverse communities they seek to serve; how Greenwood reflects the contemporary effects of past injustice; and what it would take to create economic opportunities for Tulsa’s Black, Indigenous, and White working-class citizens.\n\nThe event helped me see a cultural kinship that I hadn’t expected, one that would begin pulling me inexorably toward Tulsa. Listening to Tulsans talk about racism, poverty, and trauma, the need for Greenwood’s redevelopment, and the city’s broader desire to change economic course transported me back to my childhood in New Orleans—growing up in a White working-class family with a single mom, wrestling with feelings of alienation, and living through Hurricane Katrina. I was a stranger in Tulsa, but I felt at home. For me, Greenwood could have easily been the Lower Ninth Ward. I gravitated toward Tulsa’s trauma because it resembled my own, and I understood the city’s need to reckon with it because I had undergone a similar journey myself.\n\nI sensed that both Tulsa and I had chips on our shoulders. Underestimated, we both had something to prove, and I realized that this underdog city had so much more potential than people gave it credit for. A few months later, in September 2019, I packed up my life on the Upper East Side and again lit out for the territory of northeast Oklahoma—this time for more than just a visit.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "De-extinction startup Colossal Biosciences has gene-edited mice to have mammoth-like features, creating what the company calls the Colossal Woolly Mouse. The lab mice, which have been modified to have shaggy fur and golden coats, are a demonstration of the kind of gene edits that the company hopes to perform on a much larger scale, modifying Asian elephants to more closely resemble their woolly mammoth ancestors.\n\nThe genomes of the Colossal mice were edited at multiple points to change their fur so it was longer, frizzier, and more golden than that of normal lab mice. Some of the mice also had edits to a gene involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, which should change how the animals store fat—another key difference between mammoths and Asian elephants. Out of multiple cohorts of gene-edited mice, one set had edits in seven different genes, most of which were involved in hair type and one of which controlled fat metabolism.\n\nScientists already have a good understanding of how changes in mouse genetics influence their fur, so most of the edits selected by the Colossal scientists recreated these changes rather than using mammoth DNA as the model. “We did not just shove mammoth genes into a mouse. There’s 200 million years of evolutionary divergence between them, and that wouldn’t make any sense,” from either a scientific or ethical perspective, says Beth Shapiro, chief science officer at Colossal.\n\nAs well as the genes already well understood from mouse research, the Colossal scientists also mined ancient mammoth genomes to identify three genes that seemed to be important to mammoths’ adaptation to the cold. Two of these genes influenced hair type, while a third affected fat metabolism. The researchers then tried different combinations of edits in various groups of mice, producing some mice with frizzy fur, some with curly whiskers, and some with fluffy golden coats. The experiments are described in a pre-print paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.\n\n“These mice are massively adorable,” says Colossal cofounder and CEO Ben Lamm. “They are significantly cuter than we anticipated, which probably means that our first-generation mammoths will also be equally as cute.” Lamm shared a photo of the woolly mice in their habitat at the Colossal offices, accompanied by a woolly mammoth toy and living against a snowy background. The company has no intentions to breed or sell the woolly mice, the CEO added.\n\nThe Colossal experiment raises questions about which gene edits qualify to make a mouse—or an Asian elephant—truly mammoth-like, says Vincent Lynch, a developmental biologist at the University at Buffalo in New York who wasn’t involved in the Colossal study. The Colossal mice are fluffier and frizzier than most lab mice, that’s for sure, but those traits still appear in other mice naturally. Or, to put it another way, is a Chow Chow more mammoth-like than a Chihuahua, or is it simply a much fluffier dog?\n\nWhere you land on that spectrum is partly a question of semantics, and partly one of genetics. Colossal refers to its would-be de-extinct mammoths as “cold-resistant elephants,” with the core biological traits of a mammoth, but genetically almost identical to an Asian elephant. Lamm says the company is targeting about 85 genes to create the cold-resistant elephants and has already experimented with editing 25 of those genes. The gene-edited mice, he says, will be useful for testing less visible traits like fat metabolism.",

        "title": "USAID Was Promised Emergency Waivers for Ebola and AIDS. They’re Not Working",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "At a Trump administration cabinet meeting on Wednesday, unelected South African centibillionaire Elon Musk joked about how his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) “accidentally canceled” Ebola prevention. He assured the room that DOGE had “fixed” the issue. In reality, as an Ebola outbreak continues in Uganda, the aid response from the United States has been severely curtailed by the destruction of the country’s largest foreign aid arm—and other lifesaving humanitarian programs are also still broken, including AIDS and famine work.\n\nOver the past month, DOGE has overseen the dismantling of USAID, first placing on administrative leave and then laying off the vast majority of its workers, and freezing funding for contractors implementing its programs. The State Department developed emergency humanitarian waivers intended to keep lifesaving work going—but current and former USAID workers and other public health experts have told WIRED that the waivers are useless.\n\n“The waiver is a myth” says Asia Russell, the executive director of the international HIV advocacy group Health GAP.\n\nCurrent and former USAID workers and other Ebola experts do not believe these issues are corrected, with Ebola-response teams having been dismantled and payments to partner organizations delayed, as first reported by The Washington Post. “The entire Global Health team has been gutted,” one current worker (who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retribution) tells WIRED. “So the response would be minimal.”\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head up Ebola prevention within the US, with USAID supporting efforts abroad. On January 27, the CDC was ordered to cease communications with the World Health Organization, the United Nations agency devoted to responding to public health crises.\n\n\"CDC was given an exemption to coordinate with WHO and other external partners to conduct public health outbreak and emergency response,\" CDC spokesperson Melissa Dibble told WIRED in response to questions about how the Ebola outbreak was impacted by the Trump administration changes. It is unclear when the exemption was granted.\n\nCraig Spencer, a public health professor at Brown University and epidemiologist who survived Ebola after contracting it treating patients in Guinea in 2014, says Musk’s claims about fixing the issue are wrong. He points to the stark difference between the US response to a Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda last year and the current outbreak in Uganda as evidence that things have stopped working properly. The US responded promptly to the Marburg eruption, he says, and helped contain the disease’s spread; this time around, Spencer says, Ugandan health workers struggled to get in touch with the CDC in a timely manner. While the WHO was able to step in, Spencer worries about future incidents without robust US global public health funding and infrastructure: “Outbreaks will be worse on the ground, and get bigger quicker.”\n\n“The US funding freeze has affected key outbreak response capacities,” says World Health Organization spokesperson Alexander Nyka. The absence of USAID’s Outbreak Response Team is especially keenly felt; WHO describes its services as a “game changer.” According to WHO, the US previously provided around 20 to 40 percent of funding for sudden infectious disease outbreaks.",

        "title": "The 21 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "In Recent years, Netflix and Apple TV+ have been duking it out to have the most prestigious film offerings, but some of the best movies are on Amazon Prime Video. The streamer was one of the first to go around picking up film festival darlings and other lovable favorites, and they’re all still there in the library, so if they flew under your radar the first time, now is the perfect time to catch up.\n\nOur picks for the best movies on Amazon Prime are below. All the films in our guide are included in your Prime subscription—no renting here. Once you’ve watched your fill, check out our lists for the best shows on Netflix and best movies on Disney+ if you’re looking for something else to watch.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nThe Creator\n\nAfter an artificial intelligence developed by the US government nukes Los Angeles, the world is torn. By the mid 21st century, most of the West shuns AI, but consolidated New Asia embraces the tech, leading to a high-stakes, high-tech cold war. Caught in the middle is Joshua Taylor (John David Washington), an undercover US Army operative in New Asia sent on a mission to eliminate a deadly new AI weapon. What he finds is Alphie (Madeleine Yuna Voyles), a robotic child whose ability to control technology could change the world—and who may be connected to his lost wife Maya (Gemma Chan). A sleeper hit that you probably missed in cinemas, director Gareth Edwards’ striking sci-fi future isn't only a timely exploration of the impact of AI on humanity but also feels increasingly, perhaps worryingly, plausible with each passing day.\n\nChallengers\n\nDirected by Luca Guadagnino (Call Me by Your Name), Challengers follows the complicated three-way relationship between tennis aces Tashi (Zendaya), Patrick (Josh O'Connor), and Art (Mike Faist). Told nonlinearly, it volleys between the trio's disaffected present and their more optimistic, exciting past. It's an energetic and inventively shot sports movie, but the real match tension is in how the promise of Grand Slam glory (and no shortage of raging hormones—it is a Guadagnino film, after all) in the trio's youth lead to choices that ricochet into the present. Tashi has been forced to abandon the court after a horrific injury, her now-husband Art is stuck in a competitive rut, and Patrick hustles low-stakes games to get by—but none of them have really moved on.\n\nMy Old Ass\n\nThe unstoppable rise of Aubrey Plaza continues in this smart, modern take on the coming-of-age dramedy. Written and directed by The Fallout’s Megan Park, My Old Ass follows 18-year old Elliott (Maisy Stella) who, on the cusp of college and major life changes, celebrates her birthday by taking mushrooms with her friends. Mid-trip, she meets … Elliott, age 39 (Plaza). It’s when she’s sobered up that things get really trippy, though. Elliott starts receiving text messages from the future—warning her to avoid a boy named Chad. Equal parts hopeful and melancholic, and with powerful performances from both actors playing an Elliott, this film beautifully captures the messy, joyful potential of youth and the nagging, wistful “what ifs?” that come with age. A delight however old you are.\n\nKiller Heat\n\nWhen private investigator Nick Bali (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in peak gumshoe mode) is called out to a Greek island by wealthy Penelope Vardakis (Shailene Woodley) to investigate the suspicious death of her brother-in-law, Leo (Richard Madden), the first clue something is amiss is that her husband Elias is Leo’s identical twin (Madden again, unsurprisingly)—and he's acting very suspicious about the whole “dead brother” thing. Adapted from Norwegian author Jo Nesbø's short story “The Jealousy Man,” Killer Heat hits all the usual notes when it comes to modern noir thrillers—Bali butts heads with local police, uncovers secrets even his client doesn't want revealed, and gets too close to the case—meaning this murder mystery won't win any awards for originality, but for fans of the genre it's a fun, almost cozy outing. At a breezy 90 minutes, and packed with gorgeous location photography, it's a great way to see out the summer.\n\nBrittany Runs a Marathon\n\nWhen Brittany (Jillian Bell) is told by her doctor to lose weight, she uses it as a reason to take control of her life. She starts by putting on a pair of trainers and challenging herself to run one block, which quickly escalates into deciding to run the New York City Marathon. First-time director Paul Downs Colaizzo based the story on the experiences of his friend, and highlights not only the benefits of running but also the pain. This film shows that no matter how bad things get, you can still get back up.\n\nThe Idea of You\n\nThe best rom-coms tend to succeed thanks to how unrealistic they are—the improbable meet-cute, the heightened emotions, the exaggerated gestures of affection, the dizzying spin of falling head over heels for someone. It's something The Idea of You perfectly nails as it charts the relationship between successful gallery owner Solène Marchand (Anne Hathaway) and global music superstar Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine)—who also happens to be 16 years her junior. It could so easily have been cheap scandal fodder—and that’s how it’s played in-universe when the paparazzi get wind of Hayes’ relationship with the “older woman”—but as the pair embark on a globe-trotting romance, the charismatic leads serve up enough genuine chemistry to sweep the audience up in the whirlwind of it all. It’s ultimately less “will they, won’t they?” and more “should they, shouldn’t they?” thanks to a well-handled awareness of the age gap (already narrowed from the source novel by Robinne Lee), but for fans of the genre, it’s a delight.\n\nRoad House\n\nThere’s been no shortage of controversy over director Doug Liman's update of the classic ’80s action flick, from arguments over its supposed cinematic release to its use of CGI for some aspects of its bone-crunching fight scenes. Step back from the real-world drama though, and this is a fun, turn-brain-off-now way to kill a lazy afternoon. Swapping in the Florida Keys for the original’s Missouri setting, and trading Patrick Swayze’s James Dalton for Jake Gyllenhaal’s brooding Elwood Dalton—now with a tortured past as a UFC fighter, of course—this still delivers a satisfying tale of one man clearing out local crime lords, one brutal fistfight at a time. It’s far from high art, but sometimes that’s exactly what you need. If you’re still not sold, it’s worth noting that the 1989 original is also currently on Prime for you to compare and contrast.\n\nSaltburn\n\nOxford student Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) is having trouble fitting in at the prestigious British university—until he befriends the popular Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). Handsome, rich, and born to the landed gentry, Felix brings the awkward, socially invisible Oliver into his circle, eventually inviting him to spend summer at the family estate, Saltburn. But as Oliver works his way into the family's graces, his obsession with Felix takes increasingly dark and deranged turns. Oscillating between black comedy and psychological thriller, writer and director Emerald Fennel (Promising Young Woman) frames the film in 4:3 aspect ratio for a tighter, almost voyeuristic viewing experience that makes its frequently unsettling moments even more uncomfortable. Having attracted plenty of debate since its 2023 release—not least for how it questionably navigates its themes of class and social inclusion—Saltburn was one of the year's most divisive films, but one that demands your attention.\n\nThe Burial\n\nCourtroom dramas are rarely laugh riots, but this tale of funeral home director Jeremiah O'Keefe (Tommy Lee Jones) and his flashy lawyer Willie Gary (Jamie Foxx) taking on a major player in America's \"death care\" system brings a dark sense of humor to already grim proceedings. This is no comedy though. Based on true events, director Maggie Betts' (The Novitiate) latest drama retells a real-life legal case that exposed massive inequality in funereal care and the way Black communities were being regularly overcharged. Foxx and Jones are in top form throughout, but it's Jurnee Smollett as Mame Downes, Gary's rival attorney who threatens to outpace him at every turn, whose performance threatens to steal the whole movie. For a film about death, The Burial proves warmly life-affirming.\n\nA Million Miles Away\n\nCharting the life of José Hernández, this biopic—based on Hernández's own book—mixes the aspirational with the inspirational as it follows its central figure's rise from, in his own words, migrant farm worker to the first Mexican-American astronaut. Michael Peña is in fine form as Hernández, painting a picture of a man almost myopically driven to reach space, no matter the cost, while Rosa Salazar impresses as his wife Adela, refusing to fade into the background even as she puts her own dreams on pause for José to chase the stars. In lesser hands, this could all be cloying—a twee tale of hard work and achieving the American Dream, with a dash of NASA promo material on the side, but director Alejandra Márquez Abella has her lens as focused on the small beauties of life here on Earth as the splendor and sheer potential of space. A rare delight.\n\nRed, White, and Royal Blue\n\nLook, this is clearly a “best film” by a highly specific metric—and that metric is “gloriously cheesy trash.” Adapted from Casey McQuinston's best-selling novel, this intercontinental rom-com charts the relationship between First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), the \"spare\" to the British throne, going from rivals through to grudging respect, and ultimately groundbreaking romance. It's often ludicrous, including an inciting incident seeing the pair falling into a wedding cake, a tabloid-worthy tryst in a hotel room, and political intrigue surrounding Alex's mother, President Ellen Claremont (Uma Thurman, vamping scenes with a bizarre “Texan” accent), but it's all just irresistibly wholesome and upbeat. Red, White, and Royal Blue is the movie equivalent of pizza—not good for you, but still delicious.\n\nShin Masked Rider\n\nIf you’re sick of cookie-cutter Hollywood superhero movies, then this ground-up reboot of one of Japan’s most beloved heroes deserves your attention. Helmed by Hideaki Anno (Evangelion, Shin Godzilla, Shin Ultraman—“shin” meaning “new” or “true” in Japanese), this revamps the 1971 TV series Kamen Rider. Like that show, it follows motorcyclist Takeshi Hongo (Sosuke Ikematsu). Kidnapped by the terrorist organization S.H.O.C.K.E.R. and forcibly converted into a powerful cyborg, Hongo escapes before being reprogrammed as an agent of the group, instead using his newfound powers to take down its forces. However, unlike the original, Anno’s approach taps into the body horror of the core concept, while also challenging his characters—and audience—to hang onto their intrinsic humanity in the face of a world trying to dehumanize them. It’s more violent than you’d probably expect, often showing the grisly outcome of regular people getting punched by superpowered cyborgs and monsters, but never gratuitous. While those with some understanding of the source material will get more out of Shin Masked Rider, it’s an exciting outing for anyone looking for something a bit fresher from their hero movies.\n\nAir\n\nSure, nowadays Michael Jordan is a bona fide sports god, and Nike’s Air Jordan sneakers are still arguably the court shoe—but that wasn’t the case back in 1984. Jordan was a rookie, and Nike was about to close down its basketball shoe division. Enter Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), a talent scout for the footwear maker who has spotted a rising star in North Carolina who could turn everything around—he just needs to convince everyone else that Jordan is worth betting the company on. We all know how that panned out, so thankfully Air is more than a two-hour advert for shoes. Damon, Jason Bateman, Chris Tucker, and director Ben Affleck all deliver strong performances—only to be utterly eclipsed by Viola Davis in a magnetic and powerful, if somewhat underutilized, turn as matriarch Deloris Jordan—while Alex Convery’s script keeps the drama on the people and personalities involved, rather than the boardroom. In an age of franchises and endless blockbusters, Air is the sort of character-focused film that rarely gets made anymore, and is all the more enjoyable for it.\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nSacha Baron Cohen’s “Kazakh” TV reporter (even if he speaks Hebrew) travels back to the US, 14 years after his last feature-long escapade. This time Baron Cohen has brought his (Bulgarian-speaking) teenage daughter along, with the mission of giving her “as a gift” to some powerful American politicians—initially Mike Pence, then Rudy Giuliani. In classic Boratic fashion, the mockumentary follows the wacky duo on a cavalcade across Trump’s America, filming candid performances by unsuspecting characters ranging from QAnon believers to Republican activists to prim debutantes, all the way to Giuliani himself. Even the coronavirus pandemic, which struck America as the film was being shot, is subverted as a comedic plot point. Baron Cohen delivers, with the expected repertoire of shock gags and deadpanned verbal enormities, and he manages to land some punches at the expense of bigots, too. In contrast to its 2006 predecessor, many of the pranks and stunts here seem more aimed at eliciting the audience’s nervous laughter than at exposing America’s heart of darkness, but it remains a worthy—and funny—watch.\n\nShotgun Wedding\n\nA raucous spin on the traditional romcom, Shotgun Wedding lures viewers with a cliché setup—a ceremony on a tropical island, with hijinks courtesy of bickering in-laws—before exploding, literally, into an action escapade as the wedding party is taken hostage by violent pirates. If we’re being honest, it’s a little hammy and self-aware in places, but leads Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel are clearly having so much fun as bride and groom Darcy and Tom, whose special day turns into an often hilariously gory battle for survival, that it’s easy to be swept along for the ride. With a solid supporting cast, including the ever-entertaining Jennifer Coolidge as the mother of the groom stealing every scene she graces with her gloriously chaotic presence, this is a wedding worth RSVPing to.\n\nNanny\n\nAisha (Anna Diop) is a Senegalese woman working as a nanny for a rich couple in New York City, hoping to earn enough to bring her son and cousin to join her in America. However, her future is at the mercy of her employers, who seem content to leave Aisha to raise their daughter, Rose, while often withholding her pay. As the stress of the power imbalance weighs on her, Aisha begins having strange dreams of drowning, worsened by her fears of abandoning her own child. The feature debut of director Nikyatu Jusu, Nanny contrasts the horror of the immigrant experience in modern America with something darker, while swapping the expected tropes of hope and opportunity for a palpable sadness for culture and community left behind. Nanny takes a slow-burn, psychological approach to its scares, but Diop is phenomenal throughout, and the meticulous pacing and gorgeous cinematography means every frame lingers.\n\nComing 2 America\n\nRelying on nostalgia to carry new entries in long-dormant series can be risky business, but Eddie Murphy’s return to the role of Prince—now King—Akeem of Zamunda more than three decades after 1988’s Coming to America shows how to do it right. Drawn back to the US in search of a son he never knew he had, Akeem—and the audience—gets to reunite with familiar faces from the first film, before director Craig Brewer (Hustle and Flow) reverses the formula and tests the American characters with a trip to Zamunda. With a sharper, smarter, and more globally aware script than the original, Coming 2 America defies the odds to be a comedy sequel that stands up to the reputation of its predecessor.\n\nThirteen Lives\n\nDirector Ron Howard’s latest gathers a top-notch cast—including Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and Joel Edgerton—for a dramatization of the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue, where a Thai junior soccer team and their assistant coach were trapped in the flooded cave system. As an international effort mounts to save the children, the challenges of navigating miles of underwater caverns become ever more dangerous, and Howard masterfully captures every perilously claustrophobic moment of it. A nail-bitingly tense movie with some ingeniously shot aquatic scenes, Thirteen Lives is a testament to one of the most difficult rescues ever performed.\n\nOne Night in Miami …\n\nBased on the play of same name, One Night in Miami follows four icons of culture, music, and sports—Malcolm X, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, and Muhammad Ali—at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, a converging and pivotal point in their lives and careers. Meeting in a motel room in the wake of Ali’s—then still Cassius Clay—heavyweight victory over Sonny Liston in 1964, the four men discuss their roles in the movement and society as a whole, all while the audience knows the weight of history is bearing down on them. The close confines of much of the film reflect its theatrical roots, but this feature directorial debut from Regina King perfectly portrays the larger-than-life personalities of its cast. Kingsley Ben-Adir is on fire as Malcolm X, with Aldis Hodge, Leslie Odom Jr., and Eli Goree—as Brown, Cooke, and Ali—all utterly magnetic.\n\nThe Report\n\nProduced by Amazon, The Report is an engrossing depiction of the US Senate's investigation into the CIA's “enhanced interrogation” program—how it came to be, who knew about it, and how the CIA massaged the facts to support its efficacy. Adam Driver stars as Daniel Jones, the lead investigator who plowed an increasingly lonely path to the truth, battling against political resistance and CIA interference all the way. Driver is, as is his habit these days, superb, and the film's 82 percent “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes is well earned.\n\nSound of Metal\n\nPunk-rock drummer and recovering addict Ruben starts experiencing hearing loss, and it threatens to upend his entire life. Faced with an impossible choice between giving up his hearing or giving up his career, Ruben begins to spiral, until his girlfriend Lou checks him into a rehab center for the deaf, forcing him to confront his own behavior as much as the future he faces. Riz Ahmed is in spectacular form as the troubled Ruben, while Olivia Cooke’s turn as Lou, who suffers with her own demons, including self-harm, is riveting. Fittingly enough, Sound of Metal also features incredibly nuanced use of sound—and its absence—as director Darius Marder crafts one of the finest dramas in recent years.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "On February 10, employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received an email asking them to list every contract at the bureau and note whether or not it was “critical” to the agency, as well as whether it contained any DEI components. This email was signed by Scott Langmack, who identified himself as a senior adviser to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Langmack, according to his LinkedIn, already has another job: He’s the chief operating officer of Kukun, a property technology company that is, according to its website, “on a long-term mission to aggregate the hardest to find data.”\n\nAs is the case with other DOGE operatives—Tom Krause, for example, is performing the duties of the fiscal assistant secretary at the Treasury while holding down a day job as a software CEO at a company with millions in contracts with the Treasury—this could potentially create a conflict of interest, especially given a specific aspect of his role: According to sources and government documents reviewed by WIRED, Langmack has application-level access to some of the most critical and sensitive systems inside HUD, one of which contains records mapping billions of dollars in expenditures.\n\nAnother DOGE operative WIRED has identified is Michael Mirski, who works for TCC Management, a Michigan-based company that owns and operates mobile home parks across the US, and graduated from the Wharton School in 2014. (In a story he wrote for the school’s website, he asserted that the most important thing he learned there was to “Develop the infrastructure to collect data.”) According to the documents, he has write privileges on—meaning he can input overall changes to—a system that controls who has access to HUD systems.\n\nBetween them, records reviewed by WIRED show, the DOGE operatives have access to five different HUD systems. According to a HUD source with direct knowledge, this gives the DOGE operatives access to vast troves of data. These range from the individual identities of every single federal public housing voucher holder in the US, along with their financial information, to information on the hospitals, nursing homes, multifamily housing, and senior living facilities that HUD helps finance, as well as data on everything from homelessness rates to environmental and health hazards to federally insured mortgages.\n\nPut together, experts and HUD sources say, all of this could give someone with access unique insight into the US real estate market.\n\nKukun did not respond to requests for comment about whether Langmack is drawing a salary while working at HUD or how long he will be with the department. A woman who answered the phone at TCC Management headquarters in Michigan but did not identify herself said Mirksi was \"on leave until July.\" In response to a request for comment about Langmack’s access to systems, HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said, “DOGE and HUD are working as a team; to insinuate anything else is false. To further illustrate this unified mission, the secretary established a HUD DOGE taskforce.” In response to specific questions about Mirski’s access to systems and background and qualifications, she said, “We have not—and will not—comment on individual personnel. We are focused on serving the American people and working as one team.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Over the summer, Amazon reduced the number of drone flights. In November, it fully adopted newer, quieter drones in College Station that deliver within a range of about 7.5 miles. Inside his house, with the double-paned windows shut and TV on, Smith could no longer hear the drones. More recently, wet winter weather has further restricted the frequency of flights. (Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson says the drones can withstand only light rain and limited temperatures.)\n\nBut things finally went back to fully normal for Smith and other residents of the woodsy communities near Amazon’s drone base in January, when the company temporarily grounded its drones nationwide for a software update process that is ongoing. Amazon plans to end its College Station lease on September 30, potentially giving the frustrated communities permanent quiet.\n\nIf Amazon had conducted the maximum number of flights outlined in its plans reviewed by the FAA, a drone might have buzzed by Smith’s house about every 58 seconds for 15 hours a day. Now, he hasn’t seen one in weeks.\n\nResidents say they have noticed wildlife return to the area. Paul Greer, who lives near the drone depot, says he heard an owl for the first time in months. Deer also are more abundant with the drones gone, he says. Even Greer’s dog, George, is at peace. Seeing and hearing the drones during walks agitated his 50-pound bull terrier. “I don’t think anybody expected the noise to be as invasive as it has been,” Greer says.\n\nAmazon’s Stephenson reiterates that the FAA review determined that the operations would not have a significant impact on wildlife and says that College Station officials conducted a test that found the drones operated below the city’s noise limits. “We work hard to listen to the community and to mitigate any potential impact from our operations,” Stephenson says. Since the company launched its new MK30 drone, he says, it hasn’t “received any community complaints, and the feedback from local officials has been positive.”\n\nSome of the College Station residents who have complained about the noise say they still largely support the testing of drones. But many believe Amazon miscalculated by locating its depot close to so many residences. The company’s first depot—now shut down—was located near businesses and vineyards in rural California. Its third and newest location is at one of its warehouses in a quiet Arizona town. A planned site in the UK is also based at a fulfillment center and largely bounded by fields and industrial parks. “I don’t think we should ban this,” Smith says of drone delivery. “If there’s a place for it, and the market needs it, then fine, but it shouldn’t mess up the peace in the neighborhood.”\n\nAmazon’s drone sector rivals, such as DroneUp and Alphabet’s Wing, have made many more deliveries, mostly by operating out of commercial areas and forming partnerships with physical retailers. That’s not so easy for Amazon, the nation’s dominant online shopping platform. It has plenty of logistics warehouses, but they’re not necessarily located close enough to customers for delivery drones to reach them.\n\nLocation, Location, Location\n\nAmazon has said little about how it chose the location of its College Station drone hub, which it began leasing in 2022. Residents such as Smith believe privacy may have played a role. The building Amazon leased is tucked away behind trees, limiting what might be visible to prying eyes. Stephenson, the Amazon spokesperson, says its choice of location involved “thorough analysis of the area” and “close collaboration with local leaders.”\n\nSmith says that during a series of community events Amazon hosted in 2022, some College Station residents were miffed by how the company highlighted cookies rather than urgent necessities as items Prime Air could deliver. He and others also asked to see the drones in action to gauge how loud they might be, but the company refused. “We ended up getting it without actually hearing it,” he says. Amazon’s Stephenson says that the demonstrations weren’t possible, because the FAA didn’t approve the drones to take flight until the end of the year when commercial operations began.",

        "title": "A Team of Female Founders Is Launching Cloud Security Tech That Could Overhaul AI Protection",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "While working on internet-of-things security in the mid-2010s, Alex Zenla realized something troubling.\n\nUnlike PCs and servers that touted the latest, greatest processors, the puny chips in IoT devices couldn't support the cloud protections other computers were using to keep them siloed and protected. As a result, most embedded devices were attached directly to the local network, potentially leaving them more vulnerable to attack. At the time, Zenla was a prodigious teen, working on IoT platforms and open source, and building community in Minecraft IRC channels. After puzzling over the problem for a few years, she started working on a technology to make it possible for nearly any device to run in its own isolated cloud space, known as a “container.” Now, a decade later, she's one of three female cofounders of a security company that's trying to change how cloud infrastructure shares resources.\n\nKnown as Edera, the company makes cloud workload isolation tech that may sound like a niche tool, but it aims to address a universal security problem when many applications or even multiple customers are using shared cloud infrastructure. Ever-growing AI workloads, for example, rely on GPUs for raw processing power instead of standard CPUs, but these chips have been designed for maximum efficiency and capacity rather than with guardrails to separate and protect different processes. As a result, an attacker that can compromise one region of a system is much more likely to be able to pivot from there and gain more access.\n\n“These problems are very hard, both on the GPU and the container isolation, but I think people were too wiling to accept trade-offs that were not actually acceptable,” Zenla says.\n\nAfter a $5 million seed round in October, Edera today announced a $15 million series A led by Microsoft's venture fund, M12. The latest in granular funding news is nothing remarkable in itself, but Edera's momentum is notable given the current, muted VC landscape and, particularly, the company's all-female roster of founders, which includes two trans women.\n\nIn the United States and around the world, venture funding for tech startups has always been a boys club with the vast majority of VC dollars going to male founders. Female founders who do get initial backing have a more difficult time raising subsequent rounds than men and face much steeper odds founding another company after one fails. And those headwinds are only getting stronger as the Trump administration in the US and Big Tech mount an assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives meant to raise awareness about these types of realities and foster inclusivity.\n\n“We can’t ignore the fact that we are a small minority in our industry, and that a lot of the changes that are happening around us are not lifting us up,” says Edera CEO and cofounder Emily Long. “We take great pride and responsibility in continuing to be in the front on this. Since our founding, I can't tell you how many incredibly technical, talented women have proactively asked us to hire them from large institutions. So you start to see that just by existing and being different, you are showing what’s possible.”\n\nFor Zenla, Long, and cofounder Ariadne Conill, who has an extensive background in open source software and security, the goal of developing Edera's container isolation technology is to make it easy (at least relatively speaking) for network engineers and IT managers to implement robust guardrails and separation across their systems so an exploited vulnerability in one piece of network equipment or a rogue insider situation won't—and can't—spiral into a disastrous mega-breach.\n\n“People have legacy applications in their infrastructure and use end-of-life software; there’s no way to do security and believe that you can always patch every existing vulnerability,” Long says. “But it inherently creates a pretty large risk profile. And then on top of that, containers were never originally designed to be isolated from each other, so you had to choose between innovation and performance and security, and we don’t want people to have that trade-off anymore.”",

        "title": "This Russian Tech Bro Helped Steal $93 Million and Landed in US Prison. Then Putin Called",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Vladislav Klyushin was having, by any measure, an awful day. The judge in his case had brushed aside his lawyers’ arguments and his friends’ appeals for leniency. She handed down a tough sentence: nine more years in US federal prison, on top of an order to forfeit a fortune, $34 million.\n\nBut if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn’t show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat—quick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin “had a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,” one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence.\n\nThere were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America’s federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow—one of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever.\n\nYou probably heard something about the swap. It’s the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States—and sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn’t learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time.\n\nThe escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One American captive was swapped just two weeks ago; at least 10 more US citizens remain imprisoned in Russia. And now, there’s a Kremlin-friendly occupant of the Oval Office, one who loves to be seen as making deals. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don’t have to squint too hard to see his scheme—which ultimately netted $93 million—as a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It’s kidnapping, hostage taking, and it’s effectively all being done on President Vladimir Putin’s orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged—to get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn’t at the very top of Moscow’s trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit.\n\nIllustration: Vartika Sharma\n\nTo the outside world, Klyushin had a rags-to-riches, fairy-tale life, with a gauzy wedding video to prove it. In a montage later obtained by US prosecutors, Klyushin dives into a country club pool; his bride-to-be, Zhannetta, sips pink champagne on an outdoor bed draped with chiffon and roses; he picks her up in a white Porsche convertible; she’s gorgeous in her backless gown; he’s handsome, if a little goofy, in his tux and subtle mullet; they dance and laugh and stare meaningfully at the fireworks punctuating the perfect night. “I do not know a more decent person than my husband,” Zhannetta later wrote to the judge in his case.\n\nThey had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin’s propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company’s software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of Telegram channels for a Kremlin worried about the “introduction of unverified or knowingly false information,” according to one local news report.\n\nKlyushin’s rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (“The company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,” a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow’s Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia’s spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an “eco-activist” (for planting “several spruces in the yard”) and a “pet-lover” (his “favourite pet is a dog”). “Broad-minded, well-read, educated,” gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin “is like getting a lesson from a guru.”",

        "content": "Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” known as X, has long cultivated craziness in its edgy projects. Perhaps the most outlandish was Loon, which aimed to deliver internet via hundreds of high-flying balloons. Loon eventually “graduated” from X as a separate Alphabet division, before its parent company determined that the business model simply didn’t work. By the time that balloon popped in 2021, one of the Loon engineers had already left the project to form a team specifically working on the data transmission part of connectivity—namely, delivering high-bandwidth internet via laser beams. Think fiber optics without the cables.\n\nIt’s not a new idea, but over the past few years, Taara, as the X project is called, has been quietly perfecting real-world implementations. Now, Alphabet is launching a new generation of its technology—a chip—that it says will not only make Taara a viable option to deliver high-speed internet, but potentially usher in a new era where light does much of the work that radio waves do today, only faster.\n\nTaara Chip 1. Courtesy of X, the Moonshot Company. Taara chip close-up. Courtesy of Kristen Sard/ X, the Moonshot Company\n\nThe former Loon engineer who leads Taara is Mahesh Krishnaswamy. Ever since he first went online as a student in his hometown of Chennai, India—he had to go to the US embassy to get access to a computer—he has been obsessed with connectivity. “Since then, I made it my life's mission to find ways to bring people like me online,” he tells me at X’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. He found his way to America and worked at Apple before joining Google in 2013. That’s where he first got motivated to use light for internet connectivity—not for transmissions to ground stations, but for high-speed data transfer between balloons. Krishnaswamy left Loon in 2016 to form a team to develop that technology, called Taara.\n\nThis is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.\n\nMy big question to Krishnaswamy was, who needs it? In the 2010s, companies like Google and Facebook made a big deal of trying to connect “the next billion users” with wild projects like Loon and high-flying drones. (Facebook even worked on the idea that’s at the core of Taara—“invisible beams of light … that transmit data 10 times faster than current versions,” as my former colleague Jessi Hempel wrote in 2016. Mark Zuckerberg quietly shut the project down in 2018.) But now, through a variety of approaches, more of the world can get connected. That’s one reason X cited for ending Loon. Most conspicuously, Elon Musk’s Starlink can provide internet anywhere in the world, and Amazon is planning a competitor named Kuiper.\n\nBut Krishnaswamy says the global connectivity problem is far from solved. “Today there are like 3 billion people still unconnected, and there is a dire need to bring them online,” he says. In addition, many more people, including in the US, have internet speeds that can’t even support streaming. As for Starlink, he says that in denser areas, a lot of people have to share the transmission, and each of them gets less bandwidth and slower speeds. “We can offer 10, if not 100 times more bandwidth to an end user than a typical Starlink antenna, and do it for a fraction of the cost,” he claims, though he seems to be referring to Taara’s future capabilities and not its current status.\n\nOver the past few years, Taara has made advances in implementing its technology in the real world. Instead of beaming from space, Taara’s “light bridges”—which are about the size of a traffic light—are earthbound. As X’s “captain of moonshots” Astro Teller puts it, “As long as these two boxes can see each other, you get 20 gigabits per second, the equivalent of a fiber-optic cable, without having to trench the fiber-optic cable.” Light bridges have complicated gimbals, mirrors, and lenses to zero in on the right spot to establish and hold the connection. The team has figured out how to compensate for potential line-of-sight interruptions like bird flights, rain, and wind. (Fog is the biggest impediment.) Once the high-speed transmission is completed from light bridge to light bridge, providers still have to use traditional means to get the bits from the bridge to the phone or computer.\n\nSanam Mozaffari and Devin Brinkley in the Taara lab. Courtesy of Peter Prato/ X, the Moonshot Company Taara's unit in the field. Courtesy of X, the Moonshot Company\n\nTaara is now a commercial operation, working in more than a dozen countries. One of its successes came in crossing the Congo River. On one side was Brazzaville, which had a direct fiber connection. On the other, Kinshasa, where internet used to cost five times more. A Taara light bridge spanning the 5-kilometer waterway provided Kinshasha with nearly equally cheap internet. Taara was also used at the 2024 Coachella music festival, augmenting what would have been an overwhelmed cellular network. Google itself is using a light bridge to provide high-speed bandwidth to a building on its new Bayview campus where it would have been difficult to extend a fiber cable.\n\nMohamed-Slim Alouini, a professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology who has worked in optics for a decade, describes Taara as “a Ferrari” of fiber-free optical. “It’s fast and reliable but quite expensive.” He says he spent around $30,000 for the last light bridge setup he bought from Alphabet for testing.\n\nThat could change with Taara’s second-generation offering. Taara’s engineers have used innovative light-augmenting solutions to create a silicon photonic chip that not only will shrink the gadgetry in its light bridges to the size of a fingernail—replacing the mechanical gimbals and costly mirrors with solid-state circuitry—but will eventually allow a single laser transmitter to pair with multiple receptors. Teller says that Taara’s technology could trigger the same kind of transformation that we saw when data storage moved from tape drives to disk drives to our current solid-state devices.\n\nTaara lightbridge alignment.\n\nIn the shorter term, Teller and Krishnaswamy hope to see Taara technology used to provide high-bandwidth internet when fiber is unavailable. One use case would be delivering elite connectivity to an island community just offshore. Or providing high-speed internet after a natural disaster. But they also have more ambitious dreams. Teller and Krishnaswamy believe that 6G might be the final iteration to use radio waves. We’re hitting a wall on the electromagnetic spectrum, they say. Traditional radio frequency bands are congested and running out of available bandwidth, making it harder to meet our growing demand for fast, reliable connectivity. “We have an enormous worldwide industry that's about to go through a very complex change,” says Teller. The answer, as he sees it, is light—which he thinks might be the key element in 7G. (You think the hype for 5G was bad? Just wait.)\n\nProfessor Alouini agrees. “Those of us who are working in the field fully believe that at some point we will need to rely on optics, because the spectrum is getting congested,” he says. Teller envisions thousands of Taara chips in mesh networks, throwing beams of light, in everything from phones to data centers to autonomous vehicles. “So to the extent that you buy this, it’s going to be a very big deal,” he says.",

        "content": "I know this is unconventional, but I’m going to start by telling you the ending. Or at least, the ending as it stands today. Most of the people involved in this story wind up either dead, maimed, spending months in a mental hospital, languishing in jail, or gone underground. It's a tragedy from almost any angle, especially because, at the outset, most of these people were idealists committed to doing as much good as possible in a world they saw as beset by existential threats. In spite of those aims, or perhaps in pursuit of them, over the course of this story their lives will devolve into senseless violence. And by the time we reach the present, six people will be killed, two others presumed dead by suicide, and at least two in hiding. Countless friends and family members will find themselves bereft. I feel it's only fair to warn you that, in this story, justice and redemption have so far proven hard to come by.\n\nHow did so much go so wrong? When did it begin to fall apart? Trying to answer these questions—as I’ve done for the past two years—is not unlike querying a chatbot powered by a large language model. The responses you receive depend on the prompts you compose. Ask the question one way, and you might elicit a set of facts adhering to one reality: The emergence of the world’s first AI-inflected death cult, whose obsessions over the prospect of a machine superintelligence eventually sent them spiraling into destruction. Tweak the prompt, and you may produce an entirely different story: of a charismatic, deranged leader spreading a carefully engineered mania to followers seeking purpose in life. Try again, and you could get the tale of a vulnerable minority, driven to act at the extremes of their convictions by a society that rejects them.\n\nBut just like the outputs produced by our current AI oracles, some of these narratives turn out to be rife with hallucinations: plausible-sounding visions of reality, but fabricated to fill the need for a greater meaning. The trouble, as I went along, was separating the truth from the delirium. I wasn't always sure that I could. To be honest, I'm still not. But here we are, and a story has to start somewhere.\n\nI.\n\nLet’s begin on an afternoon in mid-November 2019, under the redwood canopy in Northern California, along a road called Bohemian Highway. It was a Friday, and Sergeant Brian Parks of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office was on patrol along the Russian River near the town of Guerneville when a call came over his radio. Someone had dialed 911 from Westminster Woods, a wilderness camp and retreat center about 8 miles away. The caller reported that a group of several people had driven up and blocked the camp's entrance and exit with their vehicles. They'd gotten out and begun some kind of demonstration, clad in black robes and masks.\n\nSonoma sheriffs occasionally encounter protesters at Bohemian Grove, a secretive men’s club for powerful elites that also meets in the redwoods near Guerneville, but the county was typically “not a hotbed” for that sort of thing, Parks says. So he thought to himself, “You know what, I'm just going to roll that way,” and steered his car toward Westminster Woods.\n\nThe camp was hosting two groups of visitors that day. One was an alumni gathering for a nonprofit called the Center for Applied Rationality. The Bay Area group ran workshops dedicated to “developing clear thinking for the sake of humanity's future,” as they put it. People within and around CFAR, which tended to attract a cohort of young, technically adept seekers, often called themselves simply “the rationalists.” CFAR was itself an outgrowth of another organization, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, devoted to the technical endeavor of creating artificial intelligence that wouldn't destroy the world.\n\nBoth CFAR and MIRI were the brainchildren of Eliezer Yudkowsky, the now famous researcher and AI pessimist who had been warning of AI's dangers for decades. In recent years the two organizations had become intertwined with a third group, the philanthropically minded effective altruists. EA, initially focused on maximizing the value in charitable giving, had increasingly taken on MIRI’s views—namely, that the existential risk, or x-risk, posed by “unfriendly” AI trumped all of humanity’s other problems. In the rationalist world, CFAR provided the grand thinking, MIRI the technical know-how, and EA the funding to save humans from being eradicated by runaway machines.",

        "content": "When President Donald Trump’s aides and advisers relay concerns about Elon Musk's takeover of the federal government, they're often given what's intended to be a reassuring answer: Don't worry, Stephen and Katie Miller will take care of it.\n\nAs Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force dismantle key parts of the government and plan to cut the workforce at federal agencies by half or more, the Millers have become pivotal figures in Musk’s orbit, multiple sources tell WIRED. The couple has been tasked as intermediaries, bringing news about Musk’s latest targets and communications strategies to the rest of the White House, say members of Trump’s inner circle and people outside the administration who know them personally. Just over a month into the new administration, they have been privately projecting themselves as two pairs of steady hands at the till.\n\nStephen Miller is the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser; two sources described his current role as that of a prime minister. His wife, Katie Miller, is a special government employee who functions as the top communications official at DOGE. She is also on the payroll of the firm P2 Public Affairs, The Wall Street Journal reported, which has ties to Musk and several alumni of Florida governor Ron DeSantis’ 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nStephen was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term, and an architect of the administration’s anti-immigration platform, including advocating for the policy of separating migrant children from their families. Katie served in the first Trump administration as deputy press secretary at the Department of Homeland Security during Kirstjen Nielsen’s tenure before ascending to the role of press secretary in 2019 and communications director in 2020 for then-vice president Mike Pence. The Millers were married in 2020.\n\nKatie Miller, like many people associated with DOGE, is, as a special government employee, limited to working in the federal government for no more than 130 days in any given 365-day period and subject to less stringent ethics requirements than permanent employees. She was assigned to run communications for Musk prior to the transition, a White House official tells WIRED, beginning her journey with Musk as a “comms sherpa.” Now she has become the richest man in the world’s guide to life in Washington and integral to the high-velocity, high-volume barrage of cuts to the government’s workforce and spending—many of them being questioned in the courts as to their legality—that have come to dominate Trump’s first month back in office.\n\nHer relationship with Musk, the White House official says, is central to DOGE’s interactions with the rest of the White House. She’s the key intermediary, delivering the DOGE message of the day to the rest of the administration. She’s also the one to deliver any sensitive or bad news to Musk, says the official.\n\nThe Republicans who spoke to WIRED for this story all requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. They are all generally supportive of the DOGE initiatives but share varying degrees of concern about Musk harming Trump’s image and felt compelled to speak up out of an urge to protect the boss. (Trump, meanwhile, has continued to back Musk publicly with enthusiastic praise for DOGE’s cuts, most recently with a flattering introduction before Musk held court at Wednesday’s cabinet meeting.)",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Netflix has plenty of movies to watch. Maybe too many. Sometimes finding the right film at the right time can seem like an impossible task. Let us help you.

Attempting to seek justice herself, aided only by outsider and nunchaku aficionado Tony (a brilliantly against-type Elijah Wood), Ruth's decision descends into a disastrous experiment with vigilante justice. A wry but grim look at modern life, Ruth's ultimate goal is best summed up by her answer to “what do you want?” being a blunt “for people to not be assholes.” A treatise on apathy, Macon Blair's 2017 directorial debut was one of Netflix's earlier forays into producing exclusive content, but it remains one of the smartest dark comedies on the platform today.\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nAt first glance, The Two Popes is not a gripping proposition: a film where two very old men in dresses talk a lot, walk around a little bit, and then talk some more. But two top-notch performances from Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins and a stellar script from Anthony McCarten turn this prosaic premise into a film worth watching. Set in the wake of the Vatican leaks scandal and loosely inspired by true events, it follows Cardinal Bergoglio as he tries to convince Pope Benedict XVI to accept his resignation. The two men couldn't be more different—Benedict is an archconservative desperate to cling to tradition while Bergoglio is seen as a dangerous liberalizer who might erode the Church's authority. While the two men battle out their differences, the future of Catholicism hangs in the balance. If you enjoyed the recent Conclave, this is worth your time too.\n\nY Tu Mamá También\n\nIt's uncommon to find much in the way of classic films on Netflix—the algorithm must ever be fed by the churn of the new—so the availability of Alfonso Cuarón's brilliant 2001 coming-of-age movie is a real delight. Set in Mexico in 1999, Y Tu Mamá También (“And your mother, too”) follows rich kid Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his working-class friend Julio (Gael García Bernal) on a road trip with Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the wife of Tenoch’s cousin. It's a journey that sees the young men—still boys, really—competing for attention from the beautiful older woman, trapping themselves in lies and trying to get by on unearned confidence, all while claiming to be heading to a picture-perfect beach that they made up. As for why the much more mature and experienced Luisa would go along with them in the first place? Pack tissues. While the film courted controversy for its frank depiction of sex and drugs (it's not one for family film night), it remains a masterpiece; a raucous and all-too-real examination of young friendships and fragile masculinity.\n\nParasite\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho's searing 2019 thriller is the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it's abundantly clear why. Its bleak exploration of economic disparity and condemnation of capitalistic excess is focused on its South Korea setting, but it resonates with global audiences. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family as they each infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Parks, posing as household servants to live a life of proximate luxury before their deception spirals wildly out of control. Somehow, it's also darkly comedic, mocking the obliviousness of the rich classes, both to their own privileges and to the desperation of the poor. Throughout, it's exquisitely shot and expertly paced, with Bong deftly increasing the tension with every scene until everything approaches a seemingly inevitable conclusion—and then still manages to twist and subvert audience expectations. A spectacular piece of filmmaking that deserves the hype, this examination of class and inequality feels more relevant than ever.\n\nMononoke the Movie: Phantom in the Rain\n\nIn Edo Japan, two young women, Asa and Kame, aim to better their lives by entering the Inner Chambers of the Imperial Palace, where dozens if not hundreds of women exchange comfort for trying to bear a male heir. Yet as they enter, they find themselves trapped in something more like a cult, with a dark and unnatural presence lurking in the heart of the castle. Their only hope is a wandering man known only as the Medicine Seller, possessing the skills and knowledge to exorcise the terrifying force—but men aren’t allowed in. A follow-up to the 2007 TV anime Mononoke (also available on Netflix), this stand-alone outing is not only a masterclass in tension and supernatural horror, but thanks to its stunning visual approach evoking watercolors on parchment, it’s one of the most sumptuous and visually striking pieces of animation you’ll ever see. The first of three planned Mononoke movies, Phantom in the Rain gets this trilogy off to a sensational start.\n\nCarry-On\n\nIs a movie set at Christmas in itself a Christmas movie? That debate has surged around Die Hard for decades. Now Carry-On asks the same question. A zippy thriller from House of Wax and Black Adam director Jaume Collet-Serra, this sees TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) caught in the Christmas Eve shift from hell when he’s blackmailed by a mercenary known only as the Traveler (Jason Bateman) into allowing a deadly package through security. Cue a lethal game of cat-and-mouse as Ethan tries to stop the Traveler—all with the life of Ethan’s girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) in the balance. It’s pulpy and schlocky in places, but this throwback action outing can’t help but entertain.\n\nJoy\n\nIn vitro fertilization may seem like a relatively mundane medical procedure nowadays, one that's brought hope and family to countless people struggling to conceive, but when the procedure was developed by a trio of British scientists and medics in the 1960s and '70s, it was hugely controversial. That makes for powerful material for this dramatization, charting the work of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie), scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy), even as they're demonized by the public, the UK government, and even—perhaps especially—the church. McKenzie in particular is brilliant as Purdy, torn by her own conflict of faith at being involved in the life-changing work, which also involved providing safe abortion care to women who needed it, and struggling to deal with the ostracizing she faces from her family and community as a result. A powerful and provocative drama, even now.\n\nEmilia Pérez\n\nSaying you’ve never seen anything like Emilia Pérez is a wild understatement. Truly, how could anything described as a “trans cartel musical” be anything but arresting to watch? At the onset, Rita (Zoe Saldaña) is an exhausted lawyer in Mexico City doing work her boss takes credit for. Everything changes when she’s contacted by a cartel boss who needs her help to receive gender-affirming care. Rita obliges, launching a partnership between the two that eventually includes launching an organization to help families who have lost members to cartel violence and a (perhaps misguided) effort to reunite the mob boss, the Emilia of the film’s title (played by Spanish actress Karla Sofía Gascón), with the wife and children who believe she’s dead. Full of changes in plot and tone that are all but impossible to see coming, director Jacques Audiard’s latest remains engaging until the final moment.\n\nThe Karate Kid\n\nIf you're hooked on the melee melodrama of Cobra Kai, you owe it to yourself to see where it all began. When Daniel LaRusso's mother moves the family from New Jersey to California, the teenager has to face the greatest threats of 1980s teen cinema: a new school, a daunting crush, and meathead bullies. Outclassed in a brawl with rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), Daniel (Ralph Macchio) convinces neighbor Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) to teach him karate. Can Mr. Miyagi's teaching methods—doing chores and learning to “wax on, wax off”—really help Daniel even the odds? Spoiler: yes. Cheesy and incredibly '80s, The Karate Kid remains a fun watch, four decades on.\n\nWoman of the Hour\n\nA serial killer is cast as a bachelor on a dating game show, allowing him to size up his next potential victim right in front of the audience watching at home. That'd be a twisted setup for a slasher flick—but what's horrifying about Woman of the Hour is that it's based on the real-life case of Rodney Alcala, who was a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the midst of a string of murders. This dramatization isn't centered on the killer, though. In her directorial debut, Anna Kendrick focuses instead on Sheryl (played by Kendrick, based on the real life Cheryl Bradshaw), the one unfortunate enough to be matched with Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), and the women who reported or suspected the killer, only to be routinely ignored by authorities. A taut thriller that makes clear the real horror lies in how easily Acala eluded attention for so long.\n\nDon't Move\n\nSingle-handedly reopening the \"man or bear\" debate, Don't Move follows a grieving young mother named Iris (Kelsey Asbille, Yellowstone) who is hunted through the wilderness after being injected with a paralytic agent by a stranger. With her body slowly shutting down, Iris has 20 minutes to escape or find help, all as her assailant, Richard (Finn Wittrock), coldly, implacably tracks her down. Directed by Adam Schindler and Brian Netto, and produced by Sam Raimi, this expertly paced game of cat-and-mouse rarely lets up, and Asbille gives an incredible performance as the increasingly immobile Iris. If you go down to the woods today … choose the bear.\n\nWill & Harper\n\nWill Ferrell likely needs no introduction, but as former head writer of Saturday Night Live, Harper Steele is more accustomed to life behind the camera. Joining the hit show in the same week back in 1995, the pair struck up a decades-long friendship—so when Harper wrote to tell Ferrell she was transitioning to live as a woman, it was a big change for them both. It also formed the basis for this beautiful, heartwarming, and often laugh-out-loud funny road trip documentary following the duo as they cross the US in an old Jeep Grand Wagoneer, reconnecting and learning what their friendship looks like now. It's awkward viewing at times—some of Ferrell's questions blur the line between bawdy and simply rude—but it's a raw and authentic journey for them both. Beyond the personal touches, Will & Harper is a timely view of what America looks like for a trans person right now, making it possibly one of the most important documentaries Netflix has produced.\n\nHis Three Daughters\n\nAs their father approaches the end of his life, sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Katie (Carrie Coon), and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) are forced to reconnect while waiting for the inevitable. Bleak stuff, but also grounds for masterful performances from the lead trio, with Rachel having taken on the bulk of care for months, Katie casting imperious demands despite avoiding the situation, and new-agey Christina trying to keep the peace—despite being at a breaking point herself. This is almost a locked-room piece, the apartment trapping the women, forcing them to come to terms with not only their father's death but their own relationships with each other, all while Vincent (Jay O. Sanders) haunts them even before his passing. Death may loom over director Azazel Jacobs’ drama, but His Three Daughters ultimately proves oddly life-affirming.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies\n\nWhen Seita and his young sister Setsuko are orphaned in the wake of the fire-bombing of Kobe during the final days of World War II, the siblings are forced into terrible circumstances to survive. Stuck between abusive extended family and the sheer desperation of scavenging around the ruins of their destroyed hometown, it's a bleak existence—and also the basis for one of Studio Ghibli's finest works. Directed by Isao Takahata and based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave of the Fireflies is unapologetically harrowing in its exploration of how war and nationalism chew up the most vulnerable, yet peppered with moments of unwavering love as Seita attempts to protect Setsuko's innocence. This searing wartime drama is sobering but essential viewing, a film that's more than earned its ranking in the upper echelons of the Best Studio Ghibli films.\n\nRebel Ridge\n\nWhen corrupt cops run ex-Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) off the road for cycling while Black, they also seize the money he had been planning to use to post his cousin’s bail. Despite the injustice, Terry tries to do everything by the book but finds almost every aspect of the legal system against him. Out of patience, and fueled by immensely justified anger, he sets about tearing out the rot from the small town, aided only by court clerk Summer (AnnaSophia Robb). Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier could have made Rebel Ridge merely a modern day First Blood, but while there’s plenty of visceral, bone-breaking fight scenes, it’s the film’s righteously angry look at the baked-in failings of the American legal system that gives this its bite—all while cementing Pierre as an action star to watch.\n\nWicked Little Letters\n\nBased on real events, Wicked Little Letters is set in 1920, in the quaint English town of Littlehampton. When the well-to-do family of Edith Swan starts receiving abusive mail, Irish immigrant Rose Gooding—who has a reputation as a foul-mouthed troublemaker, and who recently fell out with Edith—is suspect number one. Yet as the plague of \"poison pen\" notes spreads, becoming a national scandal, only overlooked police officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) believes that Rose is being set up. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman is on top form as Edith, while Jessie Buckley delights with a fiery performance as Rose in this surprisingly uproarious comedy.\n\nUnder Paris\n\nThis so-serious-it's-ludicrous French creature feature sees Bérénice Bejo as marine specialist Sophia Assalas, who is hunting down a mako shark that has not only spontaneously mutated to survive in the freshwater Seine but is also about to give birth to a host of baby man-eating sharks. Worse still? Paris is about to hold a triathlon, with the swim portion set to become an all-you-can-eat buffet! Look, not everything on this list needs to be high art—sometimes, you just need to see a mutant shark straight up chomping on people while increasingly desperate humans start blowing stuff up. Press Play, turn brain off, enjoy.\n\nHit Man\n\nGary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a mild-mannered professor of philosophy—and a contract killer. Well, not quite. He just poses as one, working with the New Orleans Police Department to trap people looking to hire a hit man. It's a role he's surprisingly good at, but when Madison (Adria Arjona) looks to have her abusive husband “dealt” with, Gary begins to fall for her—and the consequences could be fatal for real. In another creator’s hands, Hit Man might have been either overly grim or simply insubstantial (it's loosely based on a true story), but director Richard Linklater leverages his signature uses of sparkling dialog and brilliantly realized characters to deliver a smart action-comedy that explores the roles people play in society as much as it serves up mistaken-identity hijinks.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nDespite the presence of the eponymous kaiju, Godzilla Minus One is a film rooted in the humanity of its protagonists, deserter kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the bombings of Tokyo. Thrown together as an ersatz family as they raise an orphaned baby, their attempts to build a new life turn chaotic when the irradiated reptile descends on the city just as it's beginning to recover. Director Takashi Yamazaki's reimagining of Japan's premier kaiju netted the King of Monsters its first-ever Oscar, picking up a statue for Best Visual Effects at the 2024 Academy Awards, but this is a film that exceeds mere spectacle—it's a searing examination of life after war, and how a nation grapples with being on the losing side.\n\nSuzume\n\nSuzume Iwato (voiced by Nanoka Hara in Japanese, Nichole Sakura in English) lives with her aunt on Japan's southern island, having lost her mother in the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011. When a handsome young stranger named Souta (Hokuto Matsumura, Josh Keaton) asks her for directions to some local ruins, she follows him out of curiosity but disturbs a living keystone, accidentally unleashing an ancient power that threatens to destroy the entire country. Drawn into Souta's world, the pair chase the keystone, now in the form of a cat, across Japan in a desperate bid to reseal the destructive entity—a quest that would be easier if Souta hadn't been transformed into a child's wooden chair. The latest film from Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering with You), Suzume is a breathtakingly animated slice of magical realism with a surrealist edge—but beyond the spectacle, it's a heart-warming tale of community and humanity, each stop on the unlikely pair's journey a snapshot of people and families coming together in the wake of tragedy.\n\nMaboroshi\n\nBy any measure, Masamune lives a normal teenage existence in his rural Japanese hometown—until the local steel works erupts, mysteriously sealing the entire town in an inexplicable time bubble where no one ages. As the small community struggles to adapt, a culture that fears change emerges, initially from the presumption that residents would need to rejoin the outside world as they left it, and eventually forbids even new relationships. Yet when Masamune's strange classmate Mutsumi lures him to the ill-fated factory and introduces him to a feral young girl who should not exist, the bizarre reality they all inhabit begins to collapse. A fantasy twist on notions of youthful rebellion, the prison of familiarity, and fears of change, Maboroshi—meaning \"illusion\"—is a dazzling sophomore feature from director Mari Okada—whose 2018 debut Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms won accolades around the globe—and one that firmly establishes her as one of the most exciting creators working in animation today.\n\nRustin\n\nDirected by George C. Wolfe (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), this biopic explores the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. While perhaps best known as one of the chief organizers of 1963's March on Washington, Rustin was also openly, unapologetically gay at a time when that was phenomenally rare—and the film doesn't shy away from how that alienated many of the people he worked with, his sexuality often seen as a threat to the movement. A much-needed spotlight on an overlooked but pivotal figure in the Civil Rights Movement, elevated by a central performance from a spectacularly well-cast Colman Domingo as Rustin himself.\n\nHis House\n\nFleeing war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are now living in a run-down house at the edge of London, harassed by their neighbors even as they try to fit in. The couple are also haunted by the lives they left behind—both figuratively and (possibly) literally, with visions of their late daughter Nyagak, who did not survive the journey, fading in and out of the walls of their dismal new home. The real horror of His House isn't the strange visions, haunted house, or potential ghosts, though—it’s the bleakness of the lives Bol and Rial are forced into, the hostility and dehumanization of the UK asylum process, the racism both overt and casual, all coupled with the enormous sense of loss they carry with them. Blending the macabre with the mundane, director Remi Weekes delivers a tense, challenging film that will haunt viewers as much as its characters.\n\nThe Black Book\n\nPaul Edima (Richard Mofe-Damijo) lives a peaceful life as a church deacon, trying to atone for—or at least forget—his former deeds as a highly trained special agent. Plans to leave his violent and bloody past behind fall apart when his son is framed for a murder and then killed by corrupt police, forcing him to fall back on old skills as he seeks vengeance. Shades of Taken, yes, but it's director Editi Effiong's raw energy and fresh takes on familiar action movie formulas that—backed by one of the highest budgets in \"Nollywood\" history—have this gritty outing topping the most-watched lists as far afield as South Korea. Expand your cinematic horizons and see what the fuss is about.\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\n\nIgnore its 41-minute runtime and set aside any arguments over whether its brevity \"counts\" as a movie—this fantastic outing sees Wes Anderson adapt a Roald Dahl work for the first time since 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the result is just as brilliant. Rather than stop-motion, as with Mr. Fox, this is a live-action affair headlined by a top tier performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the eponymous Henry Sugar, a bored rich man who gains a strange power and ultimately uses it to better the world. With a broader cast including Dev Patel, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, and shot with all of Anderson's trademark aesthetic sensibilities, this really is a wonderful story. And, if you're still bothered by the short run time, take solace in the fact that this forms a tetraptych with The Rat Catcher, The Swan, and Poison; 15-minute shorts with same cast, directed by Anderson, and all adapting other Dahl tales in his signature style.\n\nEldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate\n\nCentered on the eponymous Berlin nightclub, this documentary explores the lives of LGBTQ+ people during the interwar years, from the roaring 1920s through the rise of the Nazis and into the horrors of World War II. With a blend of archival footage, recreations, and first-person accounts, director Benjamin Cantu paints a picture of gleeful decadence, the Eldorado as an almost hallowed ground where performers and patrons alike experimented with gender expression and were free to openly display their sexuality. It's an ode to what was lost, but with an eye on the bizarre contradictions of the age, where openly gay club-goers would wear their own Nazi uniforms as the years went by. Everything the Nazis Hate is emotionally challenging viewing in places, but it serves up an important slice of queer history that many will be completely unaware of.\n\nMarry My Dead Body\n\nWu Ming-han (Greg Hsu) is not a great guy. A homophobic police officer, his life—and prejudices—are changed when he picks up an unassuming red envelope while investigating a case. Now bound under “ghost marriage” customs to Mao Mao (Austin Lin), a gay man who died under mysterious circumstances, Wu has to solve his “husband's” death before he can get on with his life. Directed by Cheng Wei-hao, better known for his thrillers and horror movies, Marry My Dead Body sees the Taiwanese director bring his supernatural stylings to this ghostly absurdist comedy for a film that transcends borders.\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone\n\nDrug dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) got shot to death last night. So why has he just woken up in bed as if nothing happened? That existential question leads Fontaine and two unlikely allies—prostitute Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) and pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx)—to uncovering a vast conspiracy centered on a Black-majority town called The Glen, where people are kept mollified by hypnotic rap music, dumbed down with drug-laced fried chicken and grape juice, and preached into obedience at church. But who’s using the town as a petri dish, and why is there a cloning lab buried underground? This lethally sharp satire from writer and debut director Juel Taylor masterfully blends genres, from the use of visual motifs and dated clichés from 1970s Blaxploitation cinema to its frequent steps into sci-fi territory and laugh-out-loud comedy. But it’s the powerhouse performances from its central cast that mark this as one to watch.\n\nNimona\n\nShapeshifter Nimona can become anything she wants, a gift that causes people to fear and shun her. If society is going to treat her like a villain, she's going to be one, so she decides to become the sidekick of the hated black knight, Ballister Blackheart. Unfortunately for the aspiring menace, Blackheart isn't quite the monster he's made out to be, and he instead tries to rein in Nimona's more murderous tendencies as he seeks to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit—and face down his old friend Ambrosius Goldenloin in the process. Adapted from N. D. Stevenson's groundbreaking graphic novel, Nimona is more than just another fanciful fantasy—it's a tale of outsiders and exiles, people trying to do right even when their community rejects them, and the joy of finding their own little band along the way. After an almost decade-long journey to the screen, this dazzlingly animated movie has become an instant classic.\n\nThe Boys in the Band\n\nSet in New York City in 1968, The Boys in the Band is a snapshot of gay life a year before Stonewall brought LGBTQ+ rights to mainstream attention. When Michael (Jim Parsons, fresh from The Big Bang Theory) hosts a birthday party for his best frenemy Harold (Zachary Quinto), he’s expecting a night of drinks, dancing, and gossip with their inner circle—until Alan, Michael’s straight friend from college, turns up, desperate to share something. As the night wears on, personalities clash, tempers fray, and secrets threaten to come to the surface in director Joe Mantello’s tense character study. Adapted for the screen by Mart Crowley, author of the original stage play, this period piece manages to be as poignant an exploration of queer relationships and identities as ever.\n\nCargo\n\nIn a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father. But with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nThe modern master of the macabre brings the wooden would-be boy to life like never before in this exquisitely animated take on Pinocchio. In a stop-motion masterpiece that hews closer to the original 1880s tale by Carlo Collodi than the sanitized Disney version, Guillermo del Toro adds his own signature touch and compelling twists to the classic story that make it darkly enchanting—expect a Blue Fairy closer to a biblically accurate many-eyed angel and a Terrible Dogfish more like a kaiju. It’s the decision to transplant the tale to World War II that’s most affecting though. Cast against the rise of fascism, with Gepetto mourning the loss of his son, the film is packed with complex themes of mortality and morality that will haunt audiences long after the credits roll. If that doesn't sell you, perhaps the fact that it won Best Animated Feature at the 2023 Academy Awards will.\n\nCall Me Chihiro\n\nAn idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run or trying to escape her past—Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections.\n\nThe Sea Beast\n\nIt's easy to imagine that the elevator pitch for The Sea Beast was “Moby Dick meets How to Train Your Dragon”—and who wouldn’t be compelled by that? Set in a fantasy world where oceanic leviathans terrorize humanity, those who hunt down the giant monsters are lauded as heroes. Jacob Holland (voiced by Karl Urban) is one such hero, adopted son of the legendary Captain Crowe and well on the way to building his own legacy as a monster hunter—a journey disrupted by stowaway Maisie Brumble (Zaris-Angel Hator), who has her own ambitions to take on the sea beasts. However, after an attempt to destroy the colossal Red Bluster goes disastrously wrong, Jacob and Maisie are stranded on an island filled with the creatures, and they find that the monsters may not be quite so monstrous after all. A rollicking sea-bound adventure directed by Chris Williams—of Big Hero 6 and Moana fame—it secured its standing as one of Netflix’s finest movies with a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars.\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nDaniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year.\n\nThe Wonder\n\nFlorence Pugh dazzles in this not-quite-horror film from Oscar-winning director Sebastián Lelio. Set in 1862, English nurse Lib Wright (Pugh) is sent to Ireland to observe Anna O’Donnell, a girl who claims to have not eaten in four months, subsisting instead on “manna from heaven.” Still grieving the loss of her own child, Lib is torn between investigating the medical impossibility and growing concern for Anna herself. Amid obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on a book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak.\n\nRRR\n\nOne of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although they come from very different walks of life, their similarities draw them together as they face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife, Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period fluff, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status. Director S. S. Rajamouli deploys brilliantly shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed.\n\nI Lost My Body\n\nAn award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France who falls for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, which makes its way across the city to try to reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, and Clapin employs brilliantly detailed animation and phenomenal color choices throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, this one dares you to make sense of it all.\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nFrustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they attempt to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best portraits of humanity since Idiocracy.",

        "content": "Astronomy lovers in America will be treated to a great show in this month. In the early morning of March 14, a total lunar eclipse will be visible. During this phenomenon, the moon won’t disappear from view but will appear deep red as if it were covered in blood.\n\nDuring a lunar eclipse, Earth blocks the light from the sun that normally illuminates the moon. On the night of March 13 and the early morning of the 14th, the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, will cover the moon during its brightest phase. Partial lunar eclipses are relatively common—but those like this that coincide with a full moon are a relative rarity. On average, each region of Earth has the chance to view a total lunar eclipse only once every 2.5 years.\n\nA second total lunar eclipse will happen this year on September 7 and will be visible in eastern parts of Africa, across much of Asia, and the western half of Australia.\n\nA video from NASA showing the timings for viewing the total lunar eclipse in the US in March 2025.\n\nThe moon appears red during a lunar eclipse because of how the sun’s light interacts with Earth’s atmosphere. Visible sunlight appears white, but is actually made up of combination of lights of different colors and frequencies, which can be defracted or scattered depending on how much of the atmosphere they have to travel through. It is for this reason that the sky appears blue when the sun is high in the sky but is often red at sunset, when the sun is low and its light is traveling longer distances through the atmosphere.\n\nWhen sunlight hits Earth’s atmosphere during a lunar eclipse, light frequencies toward the blue end of the visible spectrum are scattered outward, away from Earth’s umbra, but those with longer wavelengths, toward the red part of the spectrum, are bent inward and cast onto the moon.\n\nWhat Time Will the Lunar Eclipse Happen?\n\nAccording to NASA, the eclipse will begin at 8:57 pm Pacific Time. In Mexico, the phenomenon will start at 10:57 pm CDT, in Argentina at 12:57 am (ART) and in Spain at 5:57 am (CET). The advance of Earth’s shadow across the moon will be slow. Observers will notice that the satellite will gradually lose illumination in the lead up to the total eclipse, before turning blood red. The totality of the eclipse, or the time when the blood moon appears, is projected to happen at 11:26 pm PDT. The climax will last approximately one hour.\n\nHere is a list of the times for the start of totality for other countries in the Americas:",

        "title": "These Plants Photosynthesize Deep in the Arctic Even When There’s No Light",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nMost of life’s engines run on sunlight. Photons filter down through the atmosphere and are eagerly absorbed by light-powered organisms such as plants and algae. Through photosynthesis, the particles of light power a cellular reaction that manufactures chemical energy (in the form of sugars), which is then passed around the food web in a complex dance of herbivores, predators, scavengers, decomposers, and more.\n\nOn a bright, sunny day, there’s a wealth of photons to go around. But what happens at low light? Biologists have long been curious about just how little light photosynthesis can run on—or how many photons need to arrive, and how quickly, for a cell’s photosynthetic machinery to process carbon dioxide into oxygen and energy. Calculations have suggested a theoretical minimum of around 0.01 micromoles of photons per square meter per second, or less than one-hundred-thousandth of the light of a sunny day.\n\nFor decades, this calculation was theoretical, given the difficulties of studying photosynthesis under low light. No one could confirm it in the field, though there are plenty of places on Earth that light barely reaches. Every winter in the high Arctic, for example, the sun, hidden by the tilt of the Earth, vanishes for months. Meters of snow blanket the sea ice and block incoming light, leaving the frigid ocean below as dark as the inside of a tomb. There, biologists assumed, photosynthesizing microalgae that live in the water and ice power down for the season and wait for warmth and light to return.\n\n“People thought of the polar night as these desert conditions where there’s very little life, and things are all sleeping and hibernating and waiting for the next spring to come,” said Clara Hoppe, a biogeochemist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. “But really, people had never really looked at it.”\n\nIn winter 2020, Hoppe spent months living on a ship wedged into an ice floe, through the polar night, to study the limits of photosynthesis in the dark. Her team’s recent study in Nature Communications reported microalgae growing and reproducing at light levels at or close to the theoretical minimum—far lower than had previously been observed in nature.\n\nThe study shows that in some of the coldest, darkest places on Earth, life blooms with the barest quantum of light. “At least some phytoplankton, under some conditions, may be able to do some very useful things at very low light,” said Douglas Campbell, a specialist in aquatic photosynthesis at Mount Allison University in Canada, who was not involved in the study. “It’s important work.”\n\nClara Hoppe, a biogeochemist at the Alfred Wegener Institute, probed the limits of photosynthesis in the months-long darkness of the Arctic polar night. Photograph: Paolo Verzone\n\nThe Power of the Dark Side\n\nScientists have traditionally understood the Arctic to be a place of stasis for much of the year. In winter, organisms that can flee the frigid waters do so; those that stay live off stored reserves or sink into a silent sleep. Then, when the sun returns, the place comes back to life. During spring bloom, an upsurge in photosynthesizing algae and other microbes kick-starts the Arctic ecosystem, fueling a yearly revel, with tiny crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, polar bears, whales, and more.\n\nIt seemed to Hoppe that any phytoplankton able to get an earlier start than the competition could have a more successful summer. This led her to wonder when, precisely, the organisms could respond to the light coming back.",

        "title": "The Trump Administration Is Deprioritizing Russia as a Cyber Threat",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "As scam compounds in Southeast Asia continue to drive massive campaigns targeting victims around the world, WIRED took a deeper look at how Elon Musk’s satellite internet service provider Starlink is keeping many of those compounds in Myanmar online. Meanwhile, FTC complaints obtained by WIRED allege that an “OpenAI” job scam used Telegram to recruit workers in Bangladesh for months before the fraudsters suddenly disappeared.\n\nWIRED published the inside story of Russian tech executive Vladislav Klyushin, who—at Vladimir Putin’s behest—was part of a notable US-Russia prisoner swap last summer after he was convicted and incarcerated in the US for insider trading that netted him $93 million. Earlier this week, TVs at the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, DC, showed an apparently AI-generated video on loop of Donald Trump kissing Elon Musk’s feet. The words “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING” were superimposed over the video.\n\nWIRED conducted an investigation into Telegram groups devoted to doxing and harassing women who joined “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” groups on Facebook. And, as female entrepreneurs in tech face ever steeper odds of gaining support for a business, a team of female founders got seed funding and completed a series A round in a matter of months for the cloud container security firm Edera.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nAfter years of Russian cyber aggression against the United States and its longtime allies—including repeated election meddling, hack and leak operations, disinformation campaigns, elaborate espionage, and brazen, disruptive cyberattacks—multiple recent actions from the Trump administration have recast the US stance on the cybersecurity threats posed by the Kremlin, downplaying the risks of Russian hackers as US adversaries. The about-face comes as Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin have increasingly strengthened their ties. Consistent US intelligence community assessments of Russia's activity in cyberspace and the threat it poses to the US would indicate, though, that such a change in approach could put the US at risk.\n\nThat deprioritization of the Russia threat has come in several different forms. US State Department deputy assistant secretary for international cybersecurity Liesyl Franz said during a speech in a United Nations working group last week that the US is concerned about digital attacks from China and Iran, but did not mention Russia. A recent memo distributed at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency laid out priorities for the agency, focusing on China and defense of US systems but omitted any reference to Russia. And on Friday, the cybersecurity news outlet The Record reported that, last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered US Cyber Command to stop all cyber operational planning against Russia, including offensive digital campaigns.\n\nEight days have passed since the cryptocurrency exchange ByBit revealed that hackers stole $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum-based assets from the company, a heist that is by some measures the biggest theft of crypto in history. Now the race is on to track the stolen funds across blockchains, prevent its liquidation, or even recover it—and that race is being propelled by $140 million in bounties offered by ByBit itself. ByBit earlier this week launched a website where it’s inviting crypto sleuths to submit tips about the destination of its stolen Ethereum funds and offering as a reward 5 percent of the value of any funds that those tracers can identify and help to freeze or seize. ByBit has offered another 5 percent of the value as a separate reward for any crypto exchange or other platform that obtains the funds.\n\nAs of Friday, the website counted a dozen bounty hunters currently registered as part of that crypto-tracing effort and put the tally of paid-out rewards at around $4.3 million. The site also includes a leaderboard of tracers who have successfully identified tranches of the funds by following them across blockchains or frozen funds—as well as a list of crypto exchanges who have, by contrast, liquidated the stolen funds on behalf of the thieves. So far only one exchange, known as eXch, has been flagged as liquidating $94 million of the stolen assets. ByBit notes that eXch has refused to respond to its messages, and the exchange didn’t respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nEarlier this week, the FBI took the unusual step of publicly identifying the hackers behind that massive ByBit hack: TraderTraitor, a group of state-sponsored cybercriminals working on behalf of the North Korean government. The FBI asked the crypto industry not to launder the funds of those hackers, a part of the larger umbrella group widely known as Lazarus that has long plagued the cryptocurrency world and has stolen billions in both crypto and non-crypto assets. In its alert, the bureau also released a list of Ethereum addresses associated with the stolen funds in an effort to help the crypto industry identify and seize any part of the $1.4 billion before it can be cashed out. Crypto tracing firm TRM Labs wrote in a post Thursday that around $400 million of the funds have already been moved and may have been successfully liquidated.\n\nIn July, an entity calling itself “NullBulge” published a 1.1-TB trove of data stolen from Disney's internal Slack archive, tipping off a frenzied cleanup effort as Disney rushed to get a handle on leaked revenue numbers, employee information like passport numbers, and sensitive customer information. The breach occurred after a Disney employee, Matthew Van Andel, inadvertently downloaded malware onto his personal computer that collected his login credentials for a number of services, including, crucially, the password to his 1Password credential vault. “It’s impossible to convey the sense of violation,” he told The Wall Street Journal. Van Andel also had his credit card numbers and other personal data stolen, and then lost his job as well when a Disney audit of his work computer alleged that he had accessed porn from the device. Van Andel denies the accusation. The episode is just one in a series of breaches where malware that infects a worker’s personal computer can have major ramifications for the institution that employs them.\n\nMattia Ferrari, an Italian priest who works with a migrant-rescue group and has a close relationship with the Pope, revealed this week that he received a warning from Meta that his phone had been hacked with sophisticated spyware from Israeli-based Paragon. The news follows revelations that Luca Casarini, the founder of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, where Ferrari served as a chaplain, also had his phone compromised by spyware, as did Italian investigative reporter Francesco Cancellato. The string of spyware infections targeting Italian activists and a journalist raises the question of who might be carrying out the hacking operations, with opposition leaders calling on the administration of Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni to address the issue. Meloni’s government has denied being behind the hacking incidents. Pope Francis, who is currently in critical condition with pneumonia, has mentioned speaking to Ferrari on the phone during a TV interview in January, raising the question of whether the spies who hacked Ferrari’s phone eavesdropped on a conversation with the pope himself.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Last month, the Trump administration placed a $1 spending limit on most government-issued credit cards that federal employees use to cover travel and work expenses. The impacts are already widely felt.\n\nAt the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, scientists aren’t able to order equipment used to repair ships and radars. At the Food and Drug Administration, laboratories are experiencing delays in ordering basic supplies. At the National Park Service, employees are canceling trips to oversee crucial maintenance work. And at the Department of Agriculture and the Federal Aviation Administration, employees worry that mission-critical projects could be stalled. In many cases, employees are already unable to carry out the basic functions of their job.\n\n“The longer this disruption lasts, the more the system will break,” says a USDA official who was granted anonymity because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media about the looming crisis.\n\nA researcher at the National Institutes of Health who tests new vaccines and treatments in rodents says he has had to put experiments on hold; his lab is not able to get certain necessary materials, such as antibodies, which are needed to assess immune response. “We have animals here that are aging that will pretty soon be too old to work with,” says the researcher, who requested anonymity as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the agency. Young mice and rats that are 6 to 8 weeks old are typically used for drug and vaccine studies, but some of the animals in their lab have now aged out of that window and may have to be euthanized.\n\nThey say NIH workers have been using internal listservs to ask for reagents and lab equipment from other buildings or institutions to try to compensate for shortages, but they’re not always able to track down what they need. The NIH is made up of 27 institutes and centers, and its Bethesda, Maryland, campus is spread across more than 75 buildings. “Sometimes you need something that's really niche, and you're just not going to find it from someone else on campus,” they say.\n\nThe change comes as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency continues to hunt for alleged examples of waste across the federal government. Late last month, DOGE announced that it was working to “simplify” the government’s largest credit card program, which issues GSA SmartPay travel and purchase cards for federal employees. Last Wednesday, the agency claimed 24,000 cards had been deactivated.\n\nThe credit card program allows federal workers to bypass the typical procurement process required to buy goods and services. A 2002 report from the Department of Commerce said that, “by avoiding the formal procurement process, GSA estimates the annual savings to be $1.2 billion.” It also enables federal employees to avoid paying sales tax on expenses that the government is exempt from.\n\nAt the FDA, labs that analyze samples to ensure that food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics are safe and meet regulatory standards are already facing shortages. \"While we are always acutely aware of when Congress’ funding is going to run out, we are able to order supplies to keep things going in the lab. This abrupt ending felt like the rug was being pulled out from under us,\" says an employee at the FDA who requested anonymity because they aren't authorized to speak with the media.",

        "content": "Brian Barrett: So Tom Krause is DOGE's representative at Treasury. He is in charge of overseeing these systems as part of his job that are responsible for payouts in the trillions of dollars every year, the sort of main payout systems of the federal government. There's been a lot of legal back and forth over whether he can actually access those systems directly. So that remains to be a little bit in flux.\n\nBut importantly, he is also openly also the CEO of Cloud Software Group. When he took the position, Cloud Software Group confirmed that he was still CEO there, Treasury sent out a note saying, yes, he's still the CEO there. So he is, no bones about it, fully serving in both capacities. Why not do both? What we reported on more recently is that Cloud Software Group actually has tens of millions of dollars of active contracts with the US government, including over 10 million as I mentioned with the Treasury Department itself.\n\nAgain, there's no indication yet that anything bad has happened yet, that there is any self-dealing. But when his company's software comes up for renewal for a contract, do we think it'll get it or do we think they'll go with someone else? We'll see. But it's just so obviously, again, on its face, a conflict of interest. And again, the appearance of conflict of interest and that there's no attempt to even pretend that there is a separation of church and state.\n\nKatie Drummond: In sort of a bigger picture way, when we talk about DOGE and its operatives and Musk acolytes being installed in these agencies, I think the important bigger picture context there that you've alluded to is that Elon Musk himself is one giant conflict of interest within the federal government. This guy owns and operates a multitude of companies, many of which have a lot of dealings with various parts of the federal government, a lot of contracts, a lot of financial entanglements.\n\nAnd I think one that is particularly interesting to me that we've reported on recently is actually the FAA. We've reported that SpaceX engineers are now working within that agency. Obviously that agency has had a lot to do with SpaceX and sort of what that company has been able to accomplish or not accomplish in the United States. The FAA has levied fines against SpaceX several times as far as I'm aware.\n\nCan you talk a little bit more about the question of Elon, and particularly in the context of SpaceX, which is to be fair to him, I think one of the biggest success stories in the Musk empire is SpaceX, which has done some genuinely pretty incredible things, but obviously is now sort of right at the heart of this question of conflict of interest.\n\nBrian Barrett: And so we'll talk about the FAA specifically first because I think the circumstances under which people from SpaceX joined the FAA is just as interesting in some ways as what they're doing. So a little bit of background, Sean Duffy, who is currently heading up the FAA the other week said, we've got some SpaceX engineers coming through. They're just on a tour. They're just on a tour. They're just being given the lay of the land. Nothing more than that.",

NASA reports that the Blue Ghost lander is in a stable, vertical position.\n\n“This incredible achievement demonstrates how NASA and US companies are leading the way in space exploration for the benefit of all,” Janet Petro, NASA’s acting administrator, said in a statement on March 2. “We have already learned many lessons, and the technology and science demonstrations aboard Firefly’s Blue Ghost 1 Mission will enhance our ability to not only discover more science but also to ensure the safety of the instruments on our spacecraft for future human exploration, both near and long term.”\n\nBlue Ghost is not the first privately led mission to reach the lunar surface. That honor goes to Intuitive Machines, another Texas-based company, which attempted to land on the moon in February 2024; however, its module fell onto its side on the surface and ceased to be operational. (Intuitive Machines will get another chance on March 6, with its Athena lunar module, which launched last month.) Other companies have also tried, but their spacecraft ended up crashing.\n\nFirefly’s lander still has plenty of work ahead of it. The Blue Ghost module is carrying 10 science and technology instruments for NASA, which will operate on the surface for one lunar day, the equivalent of 14 days on Earth. As part of the NASA’s Artemis program, which will return humans to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972, Blue Ghost’s mission aims to learn more about the lunar environment, to support astronauts in future explorations of the moon and Mars. Moments after touchdown, the module captured its first images, which were shared by NASA and Firefly on their official accounts.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The Litter-Robot has been the Rolls-Royce of automatic litter boxes for the past decade or so. The oval box with a large, front-facing entrance sits on a stand with a step to better accommodate cats of all ages. The box itself has a footprint of 22 x 7 inches; it took up more height but slightly less floor space than my traditional litter box. It connects to Wi-Fi so you can track and program the box via Litter-Robot's Whisker app (available for Android and iOs). If it senses a cat at the entrance of the bowl, it will automatically stop if in the middle of a cleaning cycle and check back in 15-second intervals until it can finish.\n\nTo clean, the litter box automatically tumbles the litter using grates and gravity to separate the clumps of dirty litter, then deposits the soiled clumps in an opening below. The step doubles as a drawer with a plastic bag inside. (It comes with 25 waste drawer liners; refills are available starting at $25, but a regular plastic grocery bag would work too.) When it’s time to empty, all you need to do is pull out the step-drawer and take out the bag. The app tells you if the litter levels are optimal or need replacing, or how full the waste basket is (it will alert you when it’s full, which took roughly a week for my two cats), and it has a log of all of the times the cats have used the box and how long they were inside. It also notifies you when the cleaning cycle has begun, has been interrupted, and is complete. The box has a built-in scale, and the sensors weigh your cat every time it enters. When you set up the app, you add your cats’ profiles, and after about a week or so, it will learn which cat is which and monitor its weight changes and how often it's using the box.\n\nDuring more than a week of testing, the Litter-Robot was not able to track which cat was which, despite a nearly 7-pound difference between them, and according to the app, one cat’s weight changed by as much as 3 pounds in a period of a day. The app is continually tracking and giving updates as to when the cats' profiles will be complete, but I wish it had been able to track each individual sooner. I didn’t delay the cycle when I first set it up, and my curious kitties got startled by the tumbling litter and were afraid to use it regularly for the first several days. I’d recommend pausing the cleaning cycle until they are more comfortable, and even now I have a 30-minute delay on cleaning in case my more curious cat wants to stick around to see how the metaphorical sausage is made. Despite the hiccups with tracking weight, this automatic litter box is a game changer and I’m excited to keep using it.",

        "content": "Speaking of which, let’s not forget that DOGE has fired people working to prevent bird flu and to safeguard the US nuclear arsenal. (The problem with throwing a chainsaw around is that you don’t make clean cuts.) The agencies in question have reportedly tried to hire those workers back. Fine. But even if they’re able to, the long-term question that hasn’t been answered yet is, Who would stay? Who would work under a regime so cocksure and incompetent that it would mistakenly fire the only handful of people who actually know how to take care of the nukes? According to a recent report from The Bulwark, that brain drain is already underway.\n\nAnd this is all before the real reductions in force begin, mass purges of civil servants that will soon be conducted, it seems, with an assist from DOGE-modified, automated software. The US government is about to lose decades of institutional knowledge across who knows how many agencies, including specialists that aren’t readily replaced by loyalists.\n\nElon Musk has, at least, acknowledged that DOGE will make mistakes, and promised fast fixes. He even called one out specifically Wednesday, the cancelation of a USAID program designed to prevent the spread of Ebola. “We restored the Ebola prevention immediately,” he said during an appearance at Trump’s first cabinet meeting. “And there was no interruption.”\n\nThis is not the case, as The Washington Post first reported. Not only has Ebola prevention not been restored—it was and remains severely diminished—but the Trump administration also said Wednesday it would terminate nearly 10,000 contracts and grants from USAID and the State Department. Many of those contracts represent an attempt to lessen some form of suffering in some part of the world. It’s too many individual stories to tell, too many tragedies unfolding too far away.\n\nIt’s worse than you think in the same way that your brain breaks a little when you try to picture how deep the ocean is. It’s worse than you think because by the time the courts catch up the damage will already have been done. It’s worse than you think because the people running the government seem to have no higher mission than to watch it burn.\n\nFederal agencies could absolutely be more efficient, but we’re long past the point where efficiency is a plausible goal. DOGE’s cuts have no apparent regard for civil society or opportunity costs or long-term strategic thinking. Their targets are Elon Musk’s and Project 2025’s targets. They have found no fraud, just democracy at work. They’re apparently eager to see what happens when it no longer does.\n\nIt’s worse than you think because so far all DOGE has done is drop a boulder into the middle of a pond.

        "title": "DOGE's Misplaced War on Software Licenses",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency announced this week that it discovered large batches of unused software licenses as it continues to hunt for examples of waste in Washington. On Monday, DOGE alleged that the General Services Administration has 37,000 licenses for the file compression and encryption tool WinZip, even though the agency has only about 13,000 employees. “Fixes are actively in work,” the team wrote on Musk’s social media site X. It later alleged similar overspending at the Department of Labor.\n\nBut the purported discrepancies between licenses and employees may not be as problematic as Musk’s government wrecking crew has made them out to be.\n\nLiz Lezius, a spokesperson for the Canadian tech company Alludo, which develops WinZip and was once known as Corel, says licensing for the program is based on the number of devices on which it is installed, not the number of employees with access to the software, though she declined to comment on specific customers. “It is typical that there are more devices than employees in an organization,” Lezius tells WIRED.\n\nIn other cases, suppliers may require agencies to buy a bundle of tools to get access to one they really need, according to Ryan Triplette, executive director of the Coalition for Fair Software Licensing, an advocacy group of software developers and private sector purchasers fighting what they view as restrictive terms.\n\nAgencies may also have more licenses than employees to account for budgeting quirks and outside contractors, says a former federal official who worked on tech licensing across multiple presidential administrations. “What you’re seeing with the DOGE stuff is they are doing cursory work with limited knowledge,” says the ex-official, who is barred by their employer from speaking to the media. It “has some salience but is done in a bombastic way to make it seem like they are having more impact.”\n\nGSA acting press secretary Will Powell tells WIRED that in support of the Trump administration’s priorities, the agency is reviewing contracts and resources “to ensure our staff can perform their mission in support of American taxpayers.”\n\nOn Thursday, the DOGE account on X posted that the GSA had taken action this week “by deleting 114,163 unused software licenses & 15 underutilized / redundant software products — for a total annual savings of $9.6M.”\n\nEarlier this week, Musk reposted allegations of overspending at the Labor Department and wrote, “Most of these items are mundane and may not seem like much individually, but there are millions of minor savings that add up to billions of dollars cumulatively. Ultimately, there will be a trillion+ dollars of waste and fraud eliminated.”\n\nThe Labor Department and White House, where DOGE is located, didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nFederal agencies sometimes sign long-term contracts with software vendors, which allows them to lock in discount rates and avoid the need to renegotiate contracts every year. As a result, the number of licenses they budget for may include projected staff increases. “It’s cheaper to buy them all at once than go back and add on 500 at a time,” the former federal official says.",

The regular rectangular Honor Watch 5 has been out for a while and resembles a knock-off Apple Watch, but the new Honor Watch 5 Ultra, which I’ve been wearing for the last week, has a round face. It’s lightweight, with a classy octagonal titanium case and a sapphire crystal face. It runs Honor’s OS, so functionality is limited, and you can’t add Wear OS apps, but the pay-off is strong battery life (Honor says up to 15 days, and I’m on course for around 12). The companion Honor Health Android app tracks your activity, workouts, and sleep, and you can change faces and set up notifications from your phone. It also has a diving depth capability of up to 30 meters. It costs 279 euros.\n\nThe Honor Earbuds Open weigh just 7.9 grams and come in a nice faux leather charging case. Open earbuds are handy if you want to hear approaching traffic on a run, find ear tips uncomfortable, or worry about how gross earbuds can get when you jam them in your ears. It's a growing market, and Honor clearly wants in. I found them very comfortable, with adjustable loops to wrap around your ears and speakers that sit over rather than in your ear canal. They offer Active Noise Cancellation should you want it, which works pretty well, and real-time AI translation when paired with something like the Honor Magic 7 Pro. The Honor Earbuds Open are 149 euros.\n\nHonor also showed WIRED its new AI agent that can read and understand your screen, executing tasks on your behalf without the need to integrate with third-party APIs. Its only controlled demo the company showed off was capable of booking a table at a restaurant via the OpenTable app. It wasn't fast—the entire process played out on the screen and the user just had to watch—and it's unclear just how well this screen-reading AI agent will work with multiple apps. But it's early days for the tech, and this kind of AI agent is something every phone maker is trying to create.

In addition to the $8.8 billion alleged savings in canceled contracts, the new data on the site lists $660 million worth of real estate leases under the GSA that were canceled, and, for the first time, it lists federal government grants that have been terminated, totaling $10.3 billion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the contracts that have been deleted from DOGE's latest \"Wall of Receipts\" is the biggest contract it had listed as having canceled last week: a seven-year blanket purchase agreement from the IRS with $1.9 billion cap for \"IT strategy and modernization.\"\n\nPHOTO: Elon Musk, his son, XX Æ A-Xii, and Musk's mother, Maye Musk arrive at the White House's South Lawn, after arriving on Marine One with President Donald Trump on March 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)\n\nThe website removed this contract from its \"Wall of Receipts\" after the vendor, financial management and IT company Centennial Technologies, told the New York Times last month that the contract was actually canceled last fall, under the Biden administration.\n\nThe previous week, DOGE had to revise down its largest claimed savings contract from $8 billion to $8 million after the contract's vendor explained that the $8 billion listed on it procurement record was likely a clerical error.\n\nAnother contract that was removed from DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" in the latest updated was a five-year $150 million USAID contract under the Asia Futures Activity initiative, aimed at serving the USAID's Asia Bureau to solve \"interconnected challenges of economic growth, democratic governance, and resilience in the face of increasing health, climate, and food security threats.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives for the Cadmus Group, which had received that contract, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nDOGE also deleted from its latest \"Wall of Receipts\" what appeared to be a $149 million National Institute of Health contract awarded to software company Advanced Automation Technologies.\n\nLast week, the DOGE website listing that contract linked to a different NIH contract for leasing and maintaining refrigerated gas tanks. An NIH contract with Advanced Automation Technologies that shares the same contract ID is capped at just $1.4 million -- not the $149 million figure that had been listed by DOGE.\n\nMORE: 'Many of them will die': Hammer drops on USAID with organizations left reeling\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther terminated contracts listed in this week's data include a USAID contract for the Ukraine Confidence Building Initiative with a $256 million ceiling, from which DOGE claims to have saved $170 million that has yet to be obligated to the contractor.\n\nAnother newly listed canceled contract is the USAID's Global Health Training, Advisory, and Support Contract program, a multi-year program that started in 2021 and was capped at $682 million through 2029. DOGE claims to have saved $284 million by terminating this program.\n\nThe single biggest contract listed this week is a seven-year IT services contract from the USAID to the vendor Salient CRGT Inc., with a $597 million ceiling.\n\nSimilar to last week's data, DOGE now lists more than 940 contracts where contract obligations have already been fully delivered -- meaning that 40% of the contracts they claim to have terminated will not actually result in saving any money.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAsked about contracts that list $0 in savings last week, a White House official told ABC News that they're using a conservative methodology of calculating savings because they subtract the contracts' obligated dollars from the ceiling amounts. However, for many contracts the ceiling dollars are much higher than what is actually expected to be spent.\n\nMORE: Here are all the agencies that Elon Musk and DOGE have been trying to dismantle so far\n\nFor the $10.3 billion in federal grants the sites says it's terminated, DOGE lists each of the 3,389 grants with the name of the awarding agency and the amount of each grant, but does not lists the grant's name or purpose.\n\nSo far, much of the claimed savings from these grants have come from the USAID -- totaling $8.7 billion -- followed by $1.1 billion from the State Department, $472 million from the Education Department and $61 million from the EPA.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDOGE has also updated its list of real estate leases that have been terminated, totaling $660 million. But much of the data is now missing information regarding which agency the leases were under, whereas the site previously listed leases from across more than 40 agencies.\n\nThe current data shows $143 million worth of real estate leases under the GSA that were terminated, and the rest of the terminated leases-- totaling $516 million -- do not list their agencies.\n\nDOGE said last week that it would begin updating its website twice a week, but the current update, like the first two, came after a week.\n\nDOGE says it's saved $105 billion, though it's backtracked on some of its earlier claims originally appeared on abcnews.go.com",

        "content": "Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BI\n\nAfter a monthlong delay, Trump added new tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Tuesday.\n\nTrump added to existing China tariffs, too.\n\nHere are the goods imported into the US the most from these three countries.\n\nWhen evaluating how President Donald Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China could impact Americans, start by looking at the goods imported most from those countries.\n\nThe biggest categories are oil, electronics, and vehicles.\n\nTrump reached a deal with the leaders of both Canada and Mexico to delay tariffs by a month in early February. But the delay was temporary, and the 25% tariffs went into effect on Tuesday through an executive order. There's one big exception: Energy imports from Canada have a 10% tariff.\n\nThe president also doubled China tariffs, to 20%, as he continues to push for stronger drug policies, particularly to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US.\n\nDetails surrounding the implementation of the tariffs are still unclear, including when they could end. Trump's initial order said the tariffs would continue \"until the crisis is alleviated.\"\n\nThe proposed tariffs could affect a wide variety of goods Americans use daily. The Census Bureau reported that in 2024, the US imported over $1.3 trillion in goods from China, Mexico, and Canada combined.\n\nFrom Canada, the top 2024 imports included over $98 billion worth of crude oil and about $28 billion in passenger cars.\n\nThe US imported nearly $67 billion worth of car parts from Mexico in 2024, along with $43 billion in computers, $14 billion in medicinal equipment, and $12 billion in crude oil.\n\nChina, meanwhile, is a major supplier of electronics to the US. The census data showed that in 2024, the US imported $64 billion in cell phones and other household goods from China, $34 billion in computers, and about $31 billion in games, toys, and sporting goods.\n\nSome companies have already been preparing to increase prices as a result of Trump's tariff plans on the campaign trail. Real estate consultants previously told BI that Trump's trade plans, particularly his 25% tariffs on steel, are set to make rent and condo prices more expensive.\n\nWalmart's chief financial officer, John David Rainey, told CNBC on November 19 that price hikes are likely on the horizon if Trump implements his tariffs: \"We never want to raise prices. Our model is everyday low prices. But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.\"\n\nAdditionally, Trump's plans could amplify economic strains between the US and its trading partners. China said on Tuesday that it would impose additional tariffs of 10% to 15% on some US imports starting March 10.\n\nStory Continues",

        "content": "Editor’s note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988 to connect with a trained counselor, or visit the 988 Lifeline website.\n\nIntrigued by all the headlines about the mental health benefits of psychedelics and thinking of giving them a try? You may want to think twice, according to a new study that found a link between bad psychedelic trips and a more than twofold increased risk of death within five years.\n\n“There’s a lot of media buzz about how psychedelic-assisted therapy is really promising in clinical trials. However, we wondered how people who aren’t in those trials may react in a more real-world setting,” said lead study author Dr. Daniel Myran, a family, public health and preventative medicine physician and researcher at the University of Ottawa in Ontario.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We looked at people who’ve had a very severe adverse reaction to a hallucinogen and needed emergency care at a hospital,” Myran said. “We found their risk of death was 2.6 times higher than a similar person without the hallucination emergency.”\n\nSome people fail to find a psychedelic experience beneficial, said Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry and human ecology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison.\n\n“Maybe one in 20 people report having ongoing difficulties they ascribe to the psychedelic technique,” said Raison, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n“A year later, they say, ‘I had an experience that was so distressing to me that it messed up my ability to function, or alienated me from my family, or gave me post-traumatic stress disorder.’”\n\nBad trips requiring a visit to the hospital may be rare but serious, the study found. - FangXiaNuo/E+/Getty Images\n\nHowever, the new study, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, can only show an association between an earlier death and a bad hallucinogenic trip, said Raison, who is also the director of the Vail Health Behavioral Health Innovation Center in Colorado where psilocybin is studied.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“These studies, by their design, cannot definitively establish whether it is the bad experience with the psychedelic that’s setting people up for increased mortality,” he said. “It could well be that the things that drove the person to have a bad psychedelic experience are the things that then also make them more likely to die.”\n\nOnly a few will need hospitalization\n\nThe study analyzed medical data captured by Canada’s universal health system to see how many people visit the emergency room due to bad psychedelic experiences.\n\n“We estimate that about 97% of all people who use hallucinogens do not require care in an emergency room,” Myran said.\n\n“However, those who visit the hospital may have psychosis, very intense and disturbing hallucinations, or an intense mental health crisis,” he said. “They may have a lot of concern about feelings of self-harm, be profoundly depressed or having a panic attack.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study found suicide to be the most common reason for an early death, along with unintentional drug poisoning, respiratory disease and cancer.\n\nRisk of suicide has been an issue even in controlled clinical trials on various hallucinogens, Raison said.\n\n“In one study on psilocybin, three people out of 79 people in the high dose psilocybin group made a suicide attempt,” he said. “These were in people who found no benefit from the treatment.”\n\nThis adverse outcome occurred despite the fact that major clinical trials on psychedelics have carefully chosen participants with no worrisome medical histories, Myran said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The clinical trials carefully select the patients they admit into the study — people with a history of schizophrenia or mania with bipolar disorder who may react poorly are kicked out,” he said.\n\nDoses of psychedelic in clinical trials are carefully measured and pure, Myran added. Hallucinogens purchased on the street, however, can contain unknown amounts of the drug and be laced with dangerous impurities.\n\nIn addition, nearly all clinical trials on psychedelics have been done with the assistance of trained therapists ready to intervene if things go wrong.\n\n“You’re in a controlled environment with help standing by. That is very different from the experience for people outside of these trials,” Myran said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe use of hallucinogenic drugs such as ketamine, psilocybin and LSD has increased rapidly over the past few decades. Approximately 12%, or 31.5 million American adults, have used psilocybin or LSD over their lifetime, according to a 2024 report by RAND Corporation, a research think tank. Psilocybin use, especially microdosing, appears to be the most popular, with over 8 million people using the psychedelic in 2023, far above all other substances.\n\nIn Canada, nearly 6% of adults used a psychedelic in 2023, said Myran, adding that use could rise to about 14% for those between the ages of 20 and 24.\n\n“I worry that people read these positive headlines and say ,‘Oh, I should start taking these, it’ll be excellent for my mental health.’ We actually don’t have particularly good evidence for that,” Myran said. “I worry that some individuals might experience adverse events and harms.”\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

        "content": "President Donald Trump’s blanket 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, an extraordinary action aimed at bringing America’s top trading partners to heel. But it threatens to weaken the North American economy, including that of the United States, at a time of significant stress for inflation-weary consumers.\n\nTrump also doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%. Those duties sit atop existing tariffs on hundreds of billions in Chinese goods. China and Canada immediately retaliated with tariffs on American goods, threatening to ignite a damaging trade war.\n\nThe Trump administration said the tariffs were necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“While President Trump gave both Canada and Mexico ample opportunity to curb the dangerous cartel activity and influx of lethal drugs flowing into our country, they have failed to adequately address the situation,” according to a statement released by the White House shortly before the tariffs took effect.\n\nBut the tariffs come at a time when inflation remains stubbornly high. Americans, and the US economy as a whole, are on shakier ground, as evidenced by recent data.\n\nTrump’s tariffs threaten to raise the prices Americans pay for a wide array of goods that are imported from the three nations, which collectively shipped $1.4 trillion worth of goods to the US last year, according to Commerce Department data. That accounts for more than 40% of the value of all goods the US imported last year.\n\nThe only goods that won’t face a 25% tariff from Canada are energy-related items such as crude oil, one of the top goods the US imports from there. Instead, they’ll be subject to a 10% tax.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFresh produce, cars and car parts and electronics, including phones and computers, are among the top goods the US imports from Mexico, Canada and China that will now face tariffs between 20% and 25%.\n\nThe stocks of global carmakers that have plants in Mexico fell sharply on Tuesday morning. Germany’s Volkswagen dropped almost 4% by 5.46 a.m. ET, while Stellantis (STLA) — the maker of Chrysler and Jeep — fell nearly 7%.\n\nChina and Canada hit back\n\nBeijing retaliated on Tuesday by announcing 15% tariffs on chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton imports from the US, according to a statement from the State Council Tariff Commission. Additionally, a 10% tariff on “sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products,” was also imposed, it said.\n\nSeparately, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it added 15 American companies, including drone maker Skydio, to its export control list, which would bar Chinese companies from exporting dual-use equipment to them.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina’s retaliatory tariffs followed a “restrained, targeted approach aimed at causing pain to those industries that matter the most to the supporters of the Trump administration,” said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, head of the China Center for the Conference Board. He noted China’s tariffs give it room for negotiations to potentially avoid even more damaging tariffs down the road.\n\nSpeaking at a regular briefing on Tuesday, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, said: “China will fight till the end” if the US “insists on waging a tariff war, trade war or any other kind of war.”\n\n“I want to reiterate that the Chinese people have never feared evil or ghosts, nor have we ever bowed to hegemony or bullying. Pressure, coercion and threats are not the right ways to engage with China. Trying to exert maximum pressure on China is a miscalculation and a mistake,” he added.\n\nChina announced more measures targeting America on Tuesday. These include stopping lumber imports from the United States, suspending the permits of three US companies to export soybeans to the country and an anti-dumping investigation into some imports of American fiber optic products.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of Trump’s stated motivation for imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico is to pressure those countries into exerting stricter controls on the flow of fentanyl into the US.\n\nUS law enforcement believes a number of China-based entities supply precursor chemicals, which can be used to make finished fentanyl in labs operated by drug cartels in the US and Mexico.\n\nOn Tuesday, China’s State Council Information Office published a document outlining the steps the government had taken in recent years to control the production and distribution of fentanyl-related substances, according to China’s state news agency Xinhua. Referring to China’s approach to international drug control, Xinhua quoted the document as saying that the country “advocates mutual assistance… and opposes finger-pointing and buck-passing.”\n\nIn Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said hours before the tariffs took effect that Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods. By March 25, he said Canada would impose an additional $125 billion tariff on American goods.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” Trudeau said in a statement.\n\nThe premier of Ontario, Canada’s largest province, has also repeated his earlier threat to cut off energy supply to the US in response to Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy, with a smile on my face. And I’m encouraging every other province to do the same,” Doug Ford told reporters on Monday, adding that eastern US relies on “our energy – they need to fell the pain.”\n\nDespite Trump’s prior claims that exporters pay for tariffs, it’s actually the parties receiving goods from abroad that pay the tariff upfront. Those parties, often businesses, typically then pass on the additional tariff costs to consumers by raising prices. But in some cases, they may opt to, or be forced to, absorb the higher costs.\n\nImpact on spending\n\nAlthough America’s economy remains resilient, tariffs come during a time of increasing cracks in the foundation. A Bureau of Economic Analysis report Friday showed consumer spending unexpectedly fell in January, and a recent inflation report showed consumer prices rebounded in January and inflation continues to grow at a stubbornly high pace.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMeanwhile, consumer confidence fell the most to start a year since 2009, and a separate consumer sentiment report last month registered the biggest decline since records began in 1978. That’s a problem because consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of America’s economic activity.\n\nFriday’s jobs report is expected to show growth continues to stagnate. First-time applications for jobless benefits ticked up more than expected last week, and the Trump administration is laying off thousands of federal workers, potentially disrupting local economies. Federal spending has also been curtailed, turning off access to some people’s livelihoods and services.\n\nTrump’s immigration crackdown also threatens homebuilding, agriculture and other key industries.\n\n“Imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico threatens to chill a collaborative effort to strengthen our shared border and risks starting a trade war with America’s closest trading partners,” National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) vice president for global trade policy Tiffany Smith said in a statement Monday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSmith said NFTC, a trade organization, supports the Trump administration’s goal “to address illicit activity at our borders.” However, they are “deeply concerned” by the new tariffs, which they claim will “raise costs for American businesses and consumers and undermine US economic growth.”\n\nMore to come?\n\nTrump and his administration have suggested that the latest round of tariffs, though significant, are only the beginning.\n\nSteel and aluminum tariffs are set to go into effect March 12. And reciprocal tariffs, dollar-for-dollar tariffs that match what other countries impose on US goods, are expected to go into effect on April 2.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump keeps hinting at more tariffs to come. Last week, Trump signed an executive order to investigate lumber tariffs. Although he has long suggested America doesn’t need Canadian lumber, the tariff threatens to raise the prices of new homes, a key inflation driver for American families.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTrump also hinted Monday that he would impose tariffs on agricultural imports, in an attempt to boost domestic sales. Such tariffs would go into effect on April 2, he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.\n\nMarc Stewart, Olesya Dmitracova, Anna Cooban and Juliana Liu contributed to this article.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The director Sean Baker probably didn’t predict this outcome while he was filming Anora, his latest small-budget indie project, in the snowy Brooklyn neighborhood of Brighton Beach—that a couple years later, he’d be accepting Best Picture at the Academy Awards. It was one of five prizes that his spiky indie dramedy collected on Hollywood’s biggest night. After a drawn-out awards season in which the biggest contenders seemed often in flux, Anora dominated at a fun if elongated Oscars ceremony. This year’s Best Picture winner also took home Best Director, Best Actress, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing. Four of those trophies went to Baker, tying a record for individual wins in a night with the legendary Walt Disney; Anora’s young star Mikey Madison received the Best Actress trophy, in a fairly shocking upset over the widely tipped-to-win Demi Moore.\n\nAnora is an unconventional Oscar juggernaut. As Baker reminded audiences from the stage, it’s a true indie picture, made for $6 million and with no huge names in the cast. But after a triumphant debut at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, where it won the coveted Palme D’Or, Anora continued marching toward industry-wide recognition. The movie’s success is the culmination of a career that’s seen Baker make the most of shoestring budgets and film whole movies on an iPhone. But Anora—which bested blockbuster heavyweights like Wicked and traditional awards fare like A Complete Unknown—was an especially incongruous winner this year, as it received its flowers during a notably old-school Academy Awards ceremony. This year’s show reminded me of the extravagant, zingy celebrations of cinema from my youth, with a highly competent host leading the viewer through nearly four hours of speeches, montages, and musical numbers.\n\nRead: The filmmaker who wants to wake us from the American dream\n\nSome might see the event’s duration as a problem. Indeed, concerns over the Oscars’ length have led to some strange truncations of the show in recent years. (Remember in 2022 when the producers cut some awards categories from the live broadcast, presenting them before it began?) This year reused the 2024 ceremony’s fairly ingenious solution to the runtime problem: Just start the whole shebang earlier. The live broadcast started at 4 p.m. in Los Angeles, which meant even the comparably roomy proceedings wrapped up during prime time on the East Coast. And though some familiar causes of bloat, such as performances of each of the Best Song nominees, were absent, nature abhors a vacuum, and this year’s showrunners found plenty of other superfluous moments to include.\n\nTo be clear: I think the excess is great. The Oscars should be long, indulgent, and for the fans; the ceremony happens once a year, and it should be staged at the same absurd scale as something like the Super Bowl. Any attempt to impose rigor and order on them tends to backfire in some unexpected way anyway. This year, the show’s 97th edition, there was very little tweaking to the proven formula. Conan O’Brien served as emcee, about as seasoned a choice imaginable for a first-time host, and he did exactly what an Oscar host is supposed to do: tell pithy jokes about the nominees, do a couple of silly, scripted bits, and otherwise keep things moving with a smile on his face. O’Brien has been a pro at that sort of thing since I was in elementary school.\n\nThe choice of O’Brien as host also set the expectation that this was probably not going to be a politically charged Oscars. The comedian’s brand is more focused on irreverence than commentary; he offered one glancing gag noting that Anora is about “standing up to a powerful Russian,” but little else in that vein. He took a couple of cheerful swipes at the Best Actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón over her past inflammatory tweets, but otherwise steered clear of Oscar politicking, too; this was not a night where it felt like an attendee might take the stage to slap a presenter. Instead, the tone was self-serious, yet still fun, as exemplified by musical numbers celebrating the leading ladies of Wicked, the recently deceased producer Quincy Jones, and the James Bond franchise.\n\nRead: Conan O’Brien understood the assignment\n\nThese segments were conceptually loose—why was The Substance star Margaret Qualley suddenly onstage jerking her limbs to Paul McCartney’s Bond theme song, “Live and Let Die”? I couldn’t really tell you, but the moment felt like the kind of forgettable, florid nonsense that graces even the most polished of Oscar ceremonies. Every year, the show’s producers try to think of new ways to celebrate movies, but the hoariest methods are usually best. There were some playful twists this year, however, such as performers addressing craft-award nominees directly to spotlight their work, and the stage opening up to reveal the orchestra playing the nominated scores.\n\nBut largely, Oscar night was pleasantly familiar, a respite after years of relatively chaotic ceremonies. This year’s event did have a little more pep to it than last year’s, when Oppenheimer swept the big awards, however. Several films picked up trophies: Behind Anora in number of wins was The Brutalist, which ended up taking three categories (Best Actor, Best Cinematography, and Best Score). Dune: Part Two and Wicked each earned two technical trophies, while Emilia Pérez, the nomination leader, won for Best Supporting Actress and Best Original Song. Emilia Pérez’s turnout in particular was a fall from seeming dominance, perhaps precipitated by Gascón’s controversy.\n\nOr perhaps not. Anora reigned supreme at many of the guild awards that presage the Oscars, which tend to be the best predictors of these things. Despite the film’s offbeat subject matter—about a sex worker who impulsively marries a Russian oligarch’s son—and its screenplay filled with hectoring insults and curse words, Anora is a screwball romantic comedy at its heart. Its story clearly spoke to the widest swath of voters, even if many pundits predicted that the tonier, more highfalutin adult drama Conclave would emerge as a consensus winner. (That film, about a papal conclave gathering to select a new pope, had to make do with a sole win for Adapted Screenplay.)\n\nBaker, a chipper presence each time that he took the stage, passionately read from a piece of paper for his Best Director win. He argued for the primacy of the theatrical experience, a message that he’s been pushing throughout this awards season. Intentionally or not, the show around him was doing the same, harkening back to an older Oscars vibe—before streaming cinema and shortened cinematic “windows” were problems anyone in the audience had to deal with. Anora is currently one of the lowest-grossing Best Picture winners ever, but its $15 million domestic gross is a relative success for such a small-scale work in this day and age. Baker’s hope, which is one I share, is that his Oscar success will spur studios to reevaluate the importance of both the moviegoing experience and art that reaches beyond big-budget homogeneity. The Oscars, amid all their silliness, remain one of the best ways to get people watching interesting films of all sizes.",

        "title": "When America Persecutes Its Teachers",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "On March 13, 1953, a teacher named Julius Hlavaty appeared before the United States Senate’s Committee on Government Operations, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. Hlavaty led the mathematics department at New York City’s prestigious Bronx High School of Science, and was widely considered one of the best math teachers in America. He wore a gray chalk-striped suit, a polka-dot tie, and a textured white handkerchief in his breast pocket. He kept his white hair slicked back, and looked more like a continental industrialist than a high-school instructor.\n\nHe was there, ostensibly, to speak about Voice of America, the federally sponsored news service that McCarthy was investigating for supposedly pro-Communist leanings. Hlavaty, a Slovakian-speaking immigrant, had recorded a statement about coming to America that had been broadcast across Central Europe. But McCarthy had an ulterior motive for the hearing.\n\nHlavaty was a member of the left-wing American Labor Party, and may have been a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s. Almost immediately, McCarthy lit into him. Was he a member of the Communist Party? Not now, Hlavaty said, though he refused to talk about his past. Had he registered as a member of the ALP? Hlavaty confirmed that he had, though he didn’t see why his private political opinions were McCarthy’s business.\n\nThis article has been adapted from Clay Risen’s forthcoming book, Red Scare: Blacklists, McCarthyism, and the Making of Modern America.\n\nHlavaty had no illusion about what was going on. “It seems to me that my name tomorrow is going to be spread over all the newspapers in the country, and what I said here, which would be the strongest defense that I would have, will not be in there,” he told the committee. “What is happening here today means, if not actually, potentially, the end of a career.”\n\nThree weeks later, Hlavaty was fired by the New York City Board of Education for insubordination. The board had recently ruled that anyone refusing to cooperate with Congress—which meant not only answering interrogators’ questions, but also providing them with the names of other suspected Communists—would be summarily ousted. A week after that, Hlavaty’s wife, Fancille, a teacher in the New York suburbs, was also fired. On her last day, she told her students that she had “nothing to hide” but that “inquisitions into a person’s private beliefs, particularly of their distant past, are a danger.”\n\nMany hundreds of teachers were hounded out of the profession in the late 1940s and early ’50s by school boards, congressional committees, and ad hoc citizens’ groups. Countless more were scared away from teaching “controversial” material.\n\nSchools have always been contested ideological terrain in America, whether over who got to attend them or what would be taught there. Today we can hear echoes of the Red Scare campaign against teachers in the Trump administration’s orders to end diversity programs in education, which some worry could lead to interference in teaching about race and history. Several states, most notably Florida, have ordered schools and colleges to restrict or eliminate courses on gender, while groups such as Moms for Liberty have rallied parents to police curricula and ban books from school libraries. Ideological battles over education may be proxies for larger conflicts—Communism in the ’40s and ’50s; diversity, equity, and inclusion today. But such fights are particularly fierce because of how important schools are in shaping American values. To control the country’s education system is, in no uncertain terms, to control the country’s future.\n\n“Propaganda for New Deal doctrines, socialism, and the ‘welfare state’ is being poured into American high school children in massive doses,” the Chicago Tribune claimed in 1951. Conservative critics had long charged that the very idea of free, publicly supported education was socialistic. Now, suddenly, in the form of teachers such as Julius and Fancille Hlavaty, they seemed to have found their proof.\n\nEspecially in big cities, teachers were indeed a progressive bunch, better educated and often more worldly than the average American. A few had become Communists in the 1930s and early ’40s; a handful still were. And for a while, they had been able to bring their ideas to their classrooms—not Communism itself, but ideas that Communists shared with the broader left, about civil rights, women’s rights, labor, and foreign affairs. When the culture turned against those ideas, teachers were among the biggest targets.\n\nNew York City was the epicenter of the Red Scare in education. From 1940 to 1942, two Republican state legislators, Assemblyman Herbert Rapp and Senator Frederic Coudert Jr., held closed-door hearings that, in their secrecy and low standards of evidence, presaged the McCarthy inquiries: Hostile witnesses were forced to name names, and informers were allowed to speak with anonymity. The Board of Education fired anyone who did not cooperate, as well as anyone identified as a subversive by two or more witnesses.\n\nIn 1949, New York State passed the so-called Feinberg Law, which made membership in any group labeled subversive by the U.S. attorney general grounds for a teacher’s dismissal. A year later, the New York City Board of Education began “trials” against teachers suspected of Communist sympathies.\n\nOne such teacher, Irving Adler, led a group of union members in a suit against the Board of Education, which reached the United States Supreme Court in 1952. But the Court, in a 6–3 decision, ruled that teaching was a privilege, not a right, and that the public’s interest in keeping Communist influence out of impressionable young minds outweighed Adler’s First Amendment rights.\n\nIn their scathing dissent, the Court’s two stalwart civil libertarians, Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, wrote that teachers had no recourse under the law to explain why they had belonged to a subversive group, which might not be subversive to begin with. “Any organization committed to a liberal cause, any group organized to revolt against an hysterical trend, any committee launched to sponsor an unpopular program, becomes suspect,” the pair wrote. “In that manner, freedom of expression will be stifled.”\n\nDuring the decade-long Red Scare, from roughly 1946 to 1957, not a single American teacher was found to have imparted Communist ideas on their students, let alone acted “subversively” against the government. But that did little to allay the truly paranoid, who insisted that Communist influence worked in more subtle and sinister ways. Anti-Communist watchdog groups emerged everywhere: some national in scope, others hyperlocal.\n\nIn September 1949, a Belgian-born, Yale-trained sculptor named Suzanne Stevenson founded the Minute Women of the U.S.A., a sort of 1950s precursor to today’s Moms for Liberty. Within three years, the group claimed to have 500,000 members. The Minute Women went after Communism in all its alleged forms, but their focus was education. Stevenson gave the mothers of young children a list of subversive books, then instructed them to hunt through their school libraries and haul any suspicious titles before their local school boards. What the Minute Women considered “Communist” broadened over time. Progressive education was a target. So was civil-rights talk—the Houston chapter protested a speech at the University of Houston by Rufus Clement, the president of Atlanta University, a historically Black institution, claiming that his ideas about racial equality made him politically suspect. They managed to bar a United Nations–sponsored writing contest from Houston’s public high schools, and in 1953 forced out the deputy superintendent, who had promoted the contest as too “controversial.”\n\nGroups such as the Minute Women received significant support from national organizations with anodyne titles such as the National Council for American Education, founded by a far-right activist named Allen Zoll. During the 1930s, Zoll had founded an anti-Semitic, pro-fascist group called American Patriots, which was considered so extreme that the military refused Zoll’s application for civilian intelligence training during World War II. His new group positioned itself as a defender of patriotic education against subversives. He pumped out a steady stream of pamphlets: “How Red Are the Schools?,” “Progressive Education Increases Delinquency,” “They Want Your Child,” “Red-ucators at Harvard.” He created a blacklist of sorts, keeping track of ousted teachers and circulating the names to his subscribers around the country, to prevent educators from relocating to a new state. And he developed a running list of “subversive” books, insisting that school and public libraries get rid of them immediately. Hundreds followed his orders; one library, in Oklahoma, even burned its suspicious texts, out of expediency or stridency or both.\n\nParents and students were encouraged to act as informants, reporting their slightest suspicion about a teacher or principal. In California, the state education commissioner urged the American Legion to report “to me any evidence concerning subversive activity it may have respecting any person connected with the public schools.” School districts got help from Washington: Through its Responsibilities program, the FBI allowed administrators to request information on suspicious teachers or job applicants. According to the historian Beverly Gage, by 1955 the bureau had fulfilled 900 such requests.\n\nAll of this—the vigilantism, the censorship, the loyalty investigations—had an immense effect on teacher morale. Thousands left the profession in the early 1950s; many more surely thought better of joining in the first place. Most of those who remained kept their heads down and shied away from important if “controversial” subjects. A 1953 survey by the National Education Association found an overwhelming reluctance on the part of teachers to discuss civil rights, universal health care, capitalism, and sex. “Far more to be feared than any radicalism in our schools is the tyranny that would force education into a straightjacket of regimented conformity,” said Reverend Walter Tunks, the rector of St. Paul’s Church in Akron, Ohio, at the National Education Association’s 1953 convention in Miami Beach. “That is the real threat to our American way of life.”\n\nMany of the same people who went after elementary and high-school teachers soon opened a second front against professors on college campuses. In 1948 in Washington State, the Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities—a mini-House Un-American Activities Committee—launched investigative hearings into University of Washington professors suspected of subversion. Using tactics borrowed directly from HUAC, the committee interrogated dozens of faculty members and administrators; three professors lost their jobs, and many others had their careers derailed.\n\nBy the 1950s, more than a dozen states had barred Communists from teaching at public colleges and universities, as had scores of private colleges. Almost every state instituted some form of loyalty oath. In 1950, under pressure from the California state legislature, the University of California adopted an additional oath, forswearing belief in subversive ideas and membership in any subversive organization; as usual, subversive was largely undefined.\n\nIn most cases, universities went along. In 1953, the Association of American Universities, a group representing 37 of the country’s top educational institutions, issued a statement declaring that no Communist should be allowed to teach in a college classroom, and demanding that any academic called to testify before a government committee should speak honestly and fully. Several university presidents, including James Conant of Harvard, issued blanket statements barring Communists from their faculties. “America’s colleges and universities,” the historian Ellen Schrecker wrote, “had given Joe McCarthy and the members of HUAC a say over selecting their faculties.”\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that HUAC would single out Harvard: the best-known and most prestigious university in the country and the alma mater of so many of the liberals and progressives behind the New Deal. (Harvard was hardly a fortress of pro-Communist sentiment, however; in a 1949 poll of faculty taken by The Harvard Crimson, more than two-thirds agreed that “Communists should not be employed as teachers.”) In 1953, HUAC got several Harvard academics—including the literary scholar Granville Hicks and the historian Daniel Boorstin, both of whom had attended Harvard during the ’30s and dabbled in Communism—to name names. They testified to the existence of a Communist cell on Harvard’s campus in the ’30s, involving students and professors; though the cell was long gone, it had included one professor who remained on faculty, a physicist named Wendell Furry. Both HUAC and McCarthy called Furry to testify. At first he declined to speak, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Then, during televised hearings in 1954, he agreed to discuss his own past as a Communist, but he adamantly refused to name names. Congress voted him in contempt. He only barely managed to avoid prison time.\n\nAfter being attacked by McCarthy in Washington and losing his job at Bronx Science, Julius Hlavaty suffered a further indignity. His sole book, a student primer called Review Digest on Solid Geometry, was added to a list of titles to be removed from government-sponsored overseas libraries. In an acid letter published in The New York Times, Hlavaty wrote that his book “consists exclusively of questions, problems, and solutions in solid geometry, logarithmic and trigonometric tables, and reprints of past examinations in solid geometry. Yet it has been thought important to notify all United States libraries abroad to ban this apparently ‘dangerous’ and ‘controversial’ work.” Other books on the list included the novels of Howard Fast and the poems of Langston Hughes, two authors who had likewise refused to discuss their political beliefs before Congress.\n\nLibraries around the world removed copies of more than 300 titles by dozens of writers. A worldwide survey by the Times found that the policy was inconsistently carried out. Books were burned in Tokyo, but merely set aside in a locked room in Sydney. A book by the Times reporter Walter Duranty that was removed from the more than 40 Amerika Haus libraries across West Germany was left on the shelf in Vienna. An overzealous librarian in Buenos Aires removed not just prohibited titles such as The Maltese Falcon, by the pro-Communist novelist Dashiell Hammett, but Whittaker Chambers’s aggressively anti-Communist Witness as well.\n\nThough much of this happened under Dwight Eisenhower’s administration, even he was taken aback by the federal government’s foray into censorship. In June 1953, he traveled to Hanover, New Hampshire, to deliver the commencement address at Dartmouth College. “Don’t join the book burners,” he told the gathered students and families. “How will we defeat communism unless we know what it is, and what it teaches, and why does it have such an appeal for men, why are so many people swearing allegiance to it?” He continued: “They are part of America. And even if they think ideas that are contrary to ours, their right to say them, their right to record them, and their right to have them at places where they are accessible to others is unquestioned, or it isn’t America.”\n\nIt was a lesson that America is, apparently, still struggling to learn.\n\nThis article was adapted from the forthcoming Red Scare: Blacklists, McCarthyism, and the Making of Modern America.",

        "content": "Sign up for Trump’s Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nAt least the Oval Office meeting held by President Donald Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was held in front of the cameras. False friendliness in public by Trump and Vance, followed by behind-the-scenes treachery, would have been much more dangerous to the Ukrainian cause.\n\nInstead, Trump and Vance have revealed to Americans and to America’s allies their alignment with Russia, and their animosity toward Ukraine in general and its president in particular. The truth is ugly, but it’s necessary to face it.\n\nToday’s meeting gave the lie to any claim that this administration’s policy is driven by any strategic effort to advance the interests of the United States, however misguided. Trump and Vance displayed in the Oval Office a highly personal hatred. There was no effort here to make a case for American interests. Vance complained that Zelensky had traveled to Pennsylvania to thank U.S. ammunition workers, because, Vance charged, the appearance amounted to campaigning for the Democratic presidential ticket. “Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,” Trump angrily explained. “He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia.”\n\nBoth the president and vice president showed the U.S.-led alliance system something it needed urgently to know: The national-security system of the West is led by two men who cannot be trusted to defend America’s allies—and who deeply sympathize with the world’s most aggressive dictator.\n\nThrough the Cold War period, Americans were haunted by the fear that a person with clandestine loyalties to a hostile foreign power might somehow rise to high office. In the late 1940s, the Alger Hiss case convulsed the country. Hiss’s accusers charged—and it later proved true—that Hiss had betrayed U.S. secrets to Soviet spymasters in the 1930s, when Hiss served as a junior official in the Department of Agriculture. The secrets were not very important; they included designs for a new fire extinguisher for U.S. naval ships. But Hiss himself was a rising star. The possibility that a person with such secrets in his past might someday go on to head the Department of State or Central Intelligence Agency once tormented Americans.\n\nBut what if the loyalties were not clandestine, not secret? What if a leader just plain blurted out on national television that he despises our allies, rejects treaties, and regards a foreign adversary as a personal friend? What if he did it again and again? Human beings get used to anything. But this?\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine a president of Estonia or Moldova in that Oval Office chair, being berated by Trump and Vance. Or a president of Taiwan. Or, for that matter, the leaders of core U.S. partners such as Germany and Japan, which entrusted their nations’ security to the faith and patriotism of past American leaders, only to be confronted by the faithless men who hold the highest offices today.\n\nWe’re witnessing the self-sabotage of the United States. “America First” always meant America alone, a predatory America whose role in the world is no longer based on democratic belief. America voted at the United Nations earlier this week against Ukraine, siding with Russia and China against almost all of its fellow democracies. Is this who Americans want to be? For this is what America is being turned into.\n\nThe Trump administration’s elimination of PEPFAR, the American program to combat HIV infection in Africa, symbolizes the path ahead. President George W. Bush created the program because it would do immense good at low cost, and thereby demonstrate to the world the moral basis of American power. His successors continued it, and Congresses of both parties funded it, because they saw that the program advanced both U.S. values and U.S. interests. Trump and Vance don’t want the United States to be that kind of country anymore.\n\nAmerican allies urgently need a Plan B for collective security in a world where the U.S. administration prefers Vladimir Putin to Zelensky.\n\nThe American people need to reckon with the mess Trump and Vance are making of this country’s once-good name—and the services they are performing for dictators and aggressors. There may not be a deep cause here. Trump likes and admires bad people because he is himself a bad person. When Vance executed his personal pivot from Never Trump to Always Trump, he needed a way to prove that he had truly crossed over to the dark side beyond any possibility of reversion or redemption; perhaps his support for Russia allowed him to do that. But however shallow their motives, the consequences are profound.\n\nIn his first term, Trump sometimes seemed a rogue actor within his own administration. The president expressed strange and disquieting opinions, but his Cabinet secretaries were mostly normal and responsible people. The oddball appointees on the White House staff were contained by the many more-or-less normal appointees. This time, Trump is building a national-security system to follow his lead. He has intimidated or persuaded his caucus in the House to accept—and his caucus in the Senate not to oppose—his pro-authoritarian agenda.\n\nThe good and great America that once inspired global admiration—that good and great America still lives. But it no longer commands a consensus above party. The pro-Trump party exposed its face to the world in the Oval Office today. Nobody who saw that face will ever forget the grotesque sight.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Getting rid of the military’s top lawyers is not exactly a sign that the Trump administration wants to follow the law.\n\nOne of the first things President Donald Trump did was fire all the lawyers. Perhaps he and his minions have not read Shakespeare recently, but they intuited the role of a Shakespearean villain, nevertheless.\n\nIn Shakespeare’s Henry VI: Part 2, Dick the Butcher says to his compatriots, “The first thing we do is, let’s kill all the lawyers.” Over time, the jape has become commonplace, reflecting how much people have come to dislike lawyers. And so, some have welcomed Trump’s recent decision to fire the military’s top three lawyers, known as judge advocates general, as a justified comeuppance.\n\nOne can understand the general instinct. Lawyers can seem like nothing but a cost, enforcing rules and telling people no when they want to hear yes. Anyone who has been in a court dispute can understand the viewpoint.\n\nBut the sentiment is the wrong message to take from Shakespeare. The context in which Dick speaks makes clear that Shakespeare, at least, thought that lawyers were a bulwark against evil and that the rule of law was essential to a just and fair society. Dick and his co-conspirator Jack Cade—anti-intellectuals who wanted to burn all the books and kill anyone who could read—were leading a rebellion. They wanted to create an ignorant population, unaware of its rights and easily led.\n\nAnd so, in the context of the play, Dick’s admonition to kill the lawyers is a plan to eliminate the protectiveness of the law, by removing those who guard it and enforce its protections. Or, as Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said in a 1985 decision: “As a careful reading of that text will reveal, Shakespeare insightfully realized that disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government.”\n\nIt is clear that Trump’s team has the same reading of Shakespeare, minus the pejorative view of totalitarianism. With well-planned steps, the administration has moved to take full control of the federal bureaucracy and eliminate opposition. Consider Trump’s efforts to assert control over the leadership of the military apparatus. Although his decision to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the chief of naval operations (the only Black man and the only woman at that level) garnered many of the headlines, the most insidious step he took was his decision to fire the top judge advocates general of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Each had hundreds of lawyers working in his command.\n\nRead: A Friday-night massacre at the Pentagon\n\nJAGs are the military’s lawyers. Like lawyers in civilian life, a significant portion of what JAGs do is prosaic. They review procurement contracts and handle military personnel complaints. They prosecute and defend criminal cases involving service members accused of crimes (think Tom Cruise in A Few Good Men). They even have a role in ensuring the military’s compliance with domestic environmental laws.\n\nBut far more notable, they have a unique function in articulating the legal standards that are relevant to combat operations. They don’t command any troops, but they do guide the commanders on the legality of their operations. This can mean limiting the tactics that the troops can use or the weapons that they might employ. It means advising the troops’ on rules of engagement in a battle zone. It means attempting to ensure that unnecessary civilian casualties are avoided (think Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman in Eye in the Sky). It means, to cite one example with which I am familiar, that before U.S. CYBERCOM deploys a new cyberattack tool, the tool is reviewed to make sure that its deployment will be lawful under the laws of armed conflict.\n\nIn short, it sometimes means telling military officers or civilian military leaders no. A JAG might, for example, tell the president that he can’t deploy troops in Washington, D.C., with orders to shoot protesters in the legs, or deploy them to shoot unarmed migrants crossing the border.\n\nBut what lawyers see as enforcing the military rule of law, Trump’s loyalists see as efforts to emasculate true warriors. That’s why Pete Hegseth, Trump’s secretary of defense, has derisively called JAG officers “jagoffs” and contended that JAG officers enforcing the laws of armed combat put their own priorities ahead of “having the backs of those who are making the tough calls on the front line.”\n\nThe firing of the JAG leadership appears intended to cow JAG line attorneys and make them afraid to provide advice to military leadership that might run counter to the will of civilian command. The underlying laws won’t change, but now commanders are unlikely to get the frank legal counsel they need.\n\nRead: Lawful, but enormously destructive\n\nAnd that is a formula for disaster. In the past, the lack of legal oversight has led to significant errors, such as the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. In the future, such a lack will mean that when the next unlawful order from Trump comes down (say, a direction to U.S. CYBERCOM to use its capabilities to collect information on domestic political opponents), JAG officers will be less well placed to say no.\n\nAnd that is what Trump wants. JAG officers are sometimes called the “conscience” of the military. But Trump doesn’t want a military with a conscience. He wants a pliant military that does what he commands rather than what the law requires.\n\nFiring the JAG leadership is the first step in securing this sort of control. Getting rid of the lawyers is, as Jack Cade says, an essential step on the road to “when I am king, as king I will be.” Continuing down this path will, almost inevitably, lead to a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.",

        "title": "How the British Broke Their Own Economy",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "What’s the matter with the United Kingdom? Great Britain is the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, which ushered in an era of energy super-production and launched an epoch of productivity advancements that made many life essentials, such as clothes and food, more affordable. Today, the country suffers from the converse of these achievements: a profound energy shortage and a deep affordability crisis. In February, the Bank of England reported an ongoing productivity slump so mysterious that its own economists “cannot account fully” for it. Real wages have barely grown for 16 years. British politics seems stuck in a cycle of disappointment followed by dramatic promises of growth, followed by yet more disappointment.\n\nA new report, titled “Foundations,” captures the country’s economic malaise in detail. The U.K. desperately needs more houses, more energy, and more transportation infrastructure. “No system can be fixed by people who do not know why it is broken,” write the report’s authors, Sam Bowman, Samuel Hughes, and Ben Southwood. They argue that the source of the country’s woes as well as “the most important economic fact about modern Britain [is] that it is difficult to build almost anything, anywhere.” The nation is gripped by laws and customs that make essentials unacceptably scarce and drive up the cost of construction across the board.\n\nHousing is an especially alarming case in point. The homeownership rate for the typical British worker aged 25 to 34 declined by more than half from the 1990s to the 2010s. In that same time, average housing prices more than doubled, even after adjusting for inflation, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nRead: How the U.K. became one of the poorest countries in Western Europe\n\nThe housing shortage traces back to the postwar period, when a frenzy of nationalization swept the country. The U.K. created the National Health Service, brought hundreds of coal mines under state control, and centralized many of the country’s railways and trucking and electricity providers. In 1947, the U.K. passed the Town and Country Planning Act, which forms the basis of modern housing policy. The TCPA effectively prohibited new development without special permission from the state; “green belts” were established to restrict sprawl into the countryside. Rates of private-home building never returned to their typical prewar levels. With some spikes and troughs, new homes built as a share of the total housing stock have generally declined over the past 60 years.\n\nThe TCPA was considered reasonable and even wise at the time. Postwar Britain had been swept up by the theory that nationalization created economies of scale that gave citizens better outcomes than pure capitalism. “There was an idea that if we could rationalize the planning system … then we could build things in the right way—considered, and planned, and environmentally friendly,” Bowman told me.\n\nBut the costs of nationalization became clear within a few decades. With more choke points for permitting, construction languished from the 1950s through the ’70s. Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Conservatives rolled back nationalization in several areas, such as electricity and gas production. But their efforts to loosen housing policy from the grip of government control was a tremendous failure, especially once it was revealed that Thatcher’s head of housing policy himself opposed new housing developments near his home.\n\nHousing is, as I’ve written, the quantum field of urban policy, touching every station of urban life. Broken housing policies have a ripple effect. In London, Bowman said, the most common options are subsidized flats for the low-income and luxury units for the rich, creating a dearth of middle-class housing. As a result, the city is bifurcated between the über-wealthy and the subsidized poor. “I think housing policy is a major driver of a lot of anti-foreigner, white-supremacist, anti-Black, anti-Muslim attitudes among young people who are frustrated that so-called these people get free houses while they have to live in a bedsit or move somewhere an hour outside the city and commute in,” Bowman said.\n\nRead: The urban family exodus is a warning for progressives\n\nConstrictive housing policy in Britain has also arguably prevented other great cities from being born. If the University of Cambridge’s breakthroughs in biotech had happened in the 19th century, Bowman said, the city of Cambridge might have bloomed to accommodate new companies and residents, the same way Glasgow grew by an order of magnitude around shipbuilding in the 1800s. Instead Cambridge remains a small city of fewer than 150,000 people, its potential stymied by rules all but prohibiting its growth.\n\nThe story for transit and energy is similar: Rules and attitudes that make it difficult to build things in the world have made life worse for the British. “On a per-mile basis, Britain now faces some of the highest railway costs in the world,” Bowman, Hughes, and Southwood write. “This has led to some profoundly dissatisfying outcomes. Leeds is now the largest city in Europe without a metro system.” Despite Thatcher’s embrace of North Sea gas, and more recent attempts to loosen fracking regulations, Britain’s energy markets are still an omnishambles. Per capita electricity generation in the U.K. is now roughly one-third that of the United States, and energy use per unit of GDP is the lowest in the G7. By these measures, at least, Britain may be the most energy-starved nation in the developed world.\n\nScarcity is a policy choice. This is as true in energy as it is in housing. In the 1960s, Britain was home to about half of the world’s entire fleet of nuclear reactors. Today, the U.K. has extraordinarily high nuclear-construction costs compared with Asia, and it’s behind much of Europe in the share of its electricity generated from nuclear power—not only France but also Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, and Romania.\n\nWhat happened to British nuclear power? After North Sea oil and gas production ramped up in the 1970s and ’80s, Britain redirected its energy production away from nuclear power. Even this shift has had its own complications. In the past few years, the U.K. has passed several measures to reduce shale-gas extraction, citing earthquake risks, environmental costs, and public opposition. As a result, gas production in the U.K. has declined 70 percent since 2000. Although the country’s renewable-energy market has grown, solar and wind power haven’t increased nearly enough to make up the gap.\n\nThe comparison with France makes clear Britain’s policy error: In 2003, very large businesses in both countries paid about the same price for electricity. But by 2024, after decades of self-imposed scarcity and the supply shock of the war in Ukraine, electricity in the U.K. was more than twice as expensive as in France.\n\nThere is an inconvenient subcurrent to the U.K.’s scarcity crisis—and ours. Sixty years ago, the environmentalist revolution transformed the way governments, courts, and individuals thought about their relationship to the natural world. This revolution was not only successful but, in many ways, enormously beneficial. In the U.S., the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act brought about exactly that. But over time, American environmental rules, such as those in the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act, have been used to stop new housing developments and, ironically, even clean-energy additions. Similarly, in the U.K., any individual who sues to stop a new project on environmental grounds—say, to oppose a new road or airport—generally has their legal damages capped at £5,000, if they lose in court. “Once you’ve done that,” Bowman said, “you’ve created a one-way system, where people have little incentive to not bring spurious cases to challenge any new development.” Last year, Britain’s high-speed-rail initiative was compelled to spend an additional £100 million on a shield to protect bats in the woods of Buckinghamshire. Finding private investment is generally difficult for infrastructure developers when the path to completion is strewn with nine-figure surprise fees.\n\nSome of Britain’s problems echo across the European continent, including slow growth and high energy prices. More than a decade ago, Germany began to phase out nuclear power while failing to ramp up other energy production. The result has been catastrophic for citizens and for the ruling government. In the first half of 2024, Germans paid the highest electricity prices in the European Union. This month, Social Democrats were punished at the polls with their worst defeat since World War II. Bowman offered a droll summary: “Europe has an energy problem; the Anglosphere has a housing problem; Britain has both.”\n\nThese problems are obvious to many British politicians. Leaders in the Conservative and Labour Parties often comment on expensive energy and scarce housing. But their goals haven’t been translated into priorities and policies that lead to growth. “Few leaders in the U.K. have thought seriously about the scale of change that we need,” Bowman said. Comprehensive reform is necessary to unlock private investment in housing and energy—including overhauling the TCPA, reducing incentives for anti-growth lawsuits, and directly encouraging nuclear and gas production to build a bridge to a low-carbon-energy economy.\n\nEffective 21st-century governance requires something more than the ability to win elections by decrying the establishment and bemoaning sclerotic institutions. Progress requires a positive vision of the future, a deep understanding of the bottlenecks in the way of building that future, and a plan to add or remove policies to overcome those blockages. In a U.S. context, that might mean making it easier to build advanced semiconductors, or removing bureaucratic kludge for scientists while adding staff at the FDA to accelerate drug approval.\n\nRead: A simple plan to solve all of America’s problems\n\nIn the U.K., the bottlenecks are all too clear: Decades-old rules make it too easy for the state to block housing developments or for frivolous lawsuits to freeze out energy and infrastructure investment. In their conclusion, Bowman and his co-authors strike a similar tone. “Britain can enjoy such a renewal once more,” they write. “To do so, it need simply remove the barriers that stop the private sector from doing what it already wants to do.”",

        "title": "Conan O’Brien Understood the Assignment",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "As soon as Conan O’Brien strode onto the Oscars stage Sunday night, he looked like he belonged there. He was self-deprecating, telling the crowd to sit down before he continued, even though no one was standing. He found Demi Moore in the audience and greeted her with a grin; he had just played a pre-recorded clip of himself emerging out of her back as a nod to her work in the Best Picture–nominated body-horror film The Substance. He took several steps across the set and quipped, “I’m walking to show I have control of the stage.”\n\nHe really did have control. O’Brien has never hosted the Academy Awards before, but the comedian seemed like a veteran of the gig as he kicked off the show. That’s in part because he spent three decades working in late-night television—writing bits, interviewing celebrities, and commanding all kinds of audiences as a host. As the writer Vikram Murthi observed last year, O’Brien “is one of our last classic entertainers.”\n\nBut O’Brien’s success at the Oscars is also a result of his ability to balance the silly with the serious; every now and then, he even embodied both at the same time. His tonal agility as a performer made him well suited to a ceremony that came on the heels of two major events—the presidential election and the wildfires in Los Angeles that destroyed entire neighborhoods—while Hollywood itself has been enduring a tricky time: Studio productions have largely vacated Los Angeles after the pandemic and the dual strikes, streaming platforms continue to disrupt the traditional theater business, and a series of scandals have plagued several of the nominees seated inside the Dolby Theatre. O’Brien has been going through a rough few months, too; his parents died within days of one another in December, and he evacuated his home amid the fires. His job, on top of charming both the A-listers in the room and the people watching at home, requires knowing when and how to make his audience not only laugh but also listen.\n\nHe proved adept at the task from the jump. In some moments during his monologue, he played the role of the conventional Oscars emcee: He encouraged the crowd to applaud Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the stars of Wicked, for their performances at the beginning of the show. He poked light fun at the Best Picture nominees, and teased some of the assembled actors by showing their pre-fame headshots. (The image shown for Timothée Chalamet, for instance, was that of a sonogram.)\n\nYet he also played the unruly jester: He championed Babygirl, a 2024 film that was snubbed by the Academy, and skewered Amazon’s recent purchase of the James Bond franchise. He also deployed several harsh punch lines about the actor Karla Sofía Gascón, whose resurfaced tweets—a series of bigoted missives, including one about the Oscars themselves—essentially sank her Best Actress campaign. After the crowd gasped at his reference to Gascón, O’Brien seemed delighted, pointing at the audience, rubbing his hands together, and even jogging in place. “I’m having fun,” he said, smiling impishly.\n\nO’Brien’s giddiness was key to his opening act. It softened the strangeness of some of his gags, whether verbally sparring with his longtime friend Adam Sandler, requesting the Conclave star John Lithgow’s help to shame speech-givers into wrapping up, or performing an ironic song-and-dance number about not wasting time onstage the way that previous hosts and presenters had. These moments aren’t new to awards shows; Sandler has become a pinch hitter for live TV lately, and practically every Oscars host calls out how long the ceremony runs. But O’Brien made plain how much he sought to entertain, to hold everyone’s attention at any cost.\n\nPerhaps that’s why he successfully delivered the segment that others in his position would have tried to quickly gloss over: a serious, direct-to-camera appeal about the importance of filmmaking, especially during less-than-ideal times. “In moments such as this, any awards show can seem self-indulgent and superfluous,” he began, “but what I want to do is have us all remember why we gather here tonight … Even in the face of terrible wildfires and divisive politics, the work, which is what this is about, the work continues, and next year, and for years to come, through trauma and joy, this seemingly absurd ritual is going to be here.”\n\nHe paused. “I will not,” he said as the crowd began to laugh. “I am leaving Hollywood to run a bed-and-breakfast in Orlando, and I’d like to see you there.” It was classic Conan: goofy and ridiculous, but earnest in his excitement, too. He’d said in an interview last week that all he wanted out of the hosting gig was “to have fun onstage.” He clearly did. So did those off it.",

Strange bad, clearly. But also strange good. One unexpected development is that Reddit, long dogged by a reputation for mischief and mayhem, has achieved a kind of mass appeal. If you ask your friends where they’ve been hanging out online lately, you’re likely to hear some of them say Reddit, actually, perhaps with a tinge of surprise.\n\nReddit’s founders didn’t set out to save the web. College roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian wanted to create a mobile food-ordering service. But their idea didn’t make sense, at least not at the time. It was 2005; the iPhone didn’t exist yet. So they built something else, no less ambitious: a site that promised to be “the front page of the internet.” Reddit was a place to share all manner of memes, photographs, questions, embarrassing stories, and ideas. Users could upvote posts into internet virality, or sometimes infamy. Eventually, they built their own communities, known as subreddits.\n\nThe joy of Reddit comes from it being simultaneously niche and expansive—like an infinite world’s fair of subcultures.\n\nFor the first decade of its existence, Reddit was not exactly a respectable place to hang out. Like its spiritual cousin 4chan, Reddit was primarily known for, among other things, creepshots, revenge porn, abject racism, anti-Semitism, and violent misogyny. Endearing corners of Reddit existed, but you couldn’t get to them without stumbling over some seriously disturbing material.\n\nSome of that disturbing material is still there if you look for it, but lately, the gross stuff has been crowded out by the good stuff, and more and more people have congregated on Reddit. Last year the company went public, saw a huge swell in audience, and became profitable for the first time in its history. And though its runaway growth slowed last quarter, Reddit says it now has more than 100 million daily users and more than 100,000 active communities.\n\nThe joy of Reddit comes from it being simultaneously niche and expansive—like an infinite world’s fair of subcultures, fandoms, support groups, and curiosities. There seems to be a subreddit for everyone and everything. There are mainstream subreddits with popular appeal, such as r/askscience (26 million users) and r/technology (18 million users). But there are also more esoteric forums, such as r/rentnerzeigenaufdinge, the German-language subreddit that’s devoted to context-free photos of retirees pointing at random things. (That group’s stated purpose: Hier bekommen alte Menschen die Bühne, die sie verdienen. “Here, old people get the stage they deserve.”) There’s r/notablueberry, where people share images of berries that are not blueberries, which other people often warn them not to eat. Some subreddits exist just to deliver a punch line, like r/Lurkers, a community with more than 41,000 members in which no one posts anything at all.\n\nAsking someone where they spend time on Reddit opens a window onto their personality that can be surprisingly intimate. Here, I’ll go: I love r/whatisit, where users share photos of confusing objects they encounter; r/Honolulu, which is a mix of island news and extremely local references; r/tipofmytongue, where people ask for help finding or identifying “un-googleable” songs, movies, books, or other scraps of cultural memory; r/metropolis, dedicated entirely to Fritz Lang’s 1927 film of the same name; and r/MildlyVandalised, a place to share milquetoast visual pranks, such as a shelf of World Book Encyclopedias rearranged so their spines lined up to say WEIRD COCK. (Reddit may be less hateful these days, but it is still juvenile.)\n\nThere is a subreddit where violinists gently correct one another’s bow holds, a subreddit for rowers where people compare erg scores, and a subreddit for people who are honest-to-God allergic to the cold and trade tips about which antihistamine regimen works best. One subreddit is for people who encounter cookie cutters whose shapes they cannot decipher. The responses reliably entail a mix of sincere sleuthing to find the answer and ridiculously creative and crude joke guesses.\n\nNot everything on Reddit is merely cute, of course. I have lost count of the number of friends who have mentioned to me that they add the word Reddit to their Google searches—a shortcut to the place where they know they’ll find the best information online. Google, once the unsurpassed King of Search, has become hostile to its users, surfacing hilariously unhelpful AI responses (including telling people to eat rocks and glue) and making it woefully difficult to retrieve credible information, even when you know exactly what source you’re looking for. Reddit, by contrast, offers truly specialized knowledge for every need. It provides travel tips to every conceivable destination and practical advice for every imaginable home-improvement project. One friend told me about using Reddit to find the right tension for his tennis-racket strings and the best embroiderer for a custom hockey jersey. And although the wisdom of the crowd is not fact-checked, Reddit’s culture tends to be equal parts generous and skeptical—meaning that good, or at least helpful, information often rises to the top.\n\nRecently, on the r/creepy subreddit, someone posted about having found a tiny skeleton under the floorboards in their house. “Am I cursed for eternity now?” they wanted to know. The top reply came from someone who explained that they were a zooarchaeologist and could therefore be “95% certain this is a mouse skeleton,” and offered to send their own photo of a mouse skeleton for reference. “Hell yeah,” someone else chimed in. “Ask a random question and get an answer from someone who specializes in the exact niche. Amazing.”\n\nHow did this happen? How did Reddit go from being a disgusting fever swamp to an oasis of happiness, expertise, exuberance? Excising the most egregious subreddits was the first step, and not an uncontroversial one. Good and necessary free-speech debates followed. But the site has always given its users more control than other major social platforms. Reddit’s moderators are almost exclusively volunteers, and they are power users. They set the rules for the subreddits they run, and they tend to take their job seriously. The subreddit r/AskHistorians has a reputation for being one of the most heavily moderated communities on Reddit—rather than deleting some comments, it seems to delete most of them. If you don’t like that, and there are plenty of people who don’t, you can join another subreddit for history buffs. Or start your own.\n\nOn Reddit, it’s people—not the platform—who decide what any one community should be. (Reddit does still ban whole subreddits sometimes, as it did recently with a group posting violent threats.) Even the most ridiculous forums make their expectations known. In the subreddit r/DivorcedBirds, which is for sharing images of birds that “look like serial monogamists,” moderators specify the following: “Please post pictures of birds who look like they are twice divorced (or more!) and an original caption about their backstory.” Also: No photos of “human women”; no art, paintings, or Photoshop; and “no dead birds.”\n\nGiving users this much control over a major social platform is basically unheard-of anymore. It’s a throwback to the early web, when people had to tend to the sites they wanted to be a part of, and it’s a stark contrast to the way other social-media sites have evolved.\n\nReddit is surging at a time when much of the rest of the social web has curdled. The mainstream platforms are overrun with a combination of bots, bigots, and bad AI, especially because platforms such as X and Facebook have declared that the substance of what people post is of no concern to them. Which is how we got to the point that Reddit, of all places, has developed a reputation as a force for good, or at least a force for reminding people of the promise of a decentralized open web.\n\nFor now, Reddit remains wildly original and startlingly generous, which is to say, deeply and gorgeously human.\n\nThe social giants that worship at the altar of megascale—Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X—have chosen to do so at the expense of humanity. They train their algorithms to feed people the things that make them angry and afraid and keep them scrolling. Reddit has its own ambitions for exponential growth, but so far it has managed to retain a small-group feeling while still operating at scale.\n\nThe question is whether this is a sustainable model. What if this golden moment for Reddit is not a renaissance but a last hurrah—one final reminder of what could have been, before a tsunami of AI wipes out the places that once sparkled with humanity? Reddit recently unveiled its own AI product, Reddit Answers, to the disgust of many of its users. And some long-time users worry that something essential will be lost as normies flock to the platform.\n\nRead: Is this how Reddit ends?\n\nFor now, though, Reddit remains wildly original and startlingly generous, which is to say, deeply and gorgeously human. It provides connection to others, stokes curiosity, and—at least in some subreddits—leaves you with a feeling of time well spent, a rarity on other social platforms. Because as different as each Reddit community is, every good subreddit is irrepressibly captivating for the same reason: the people.\n\nRecently, someone posted a question on r/AskReddit: “What have you done on this platform that you’re most proud of?” The answers ranged from earnest to irreverent. People described feeling good about having used Reddit to read more, and to challenge their understanding of the world. Others praised themselves for not posting mean comments when they had the impulse to. One person described having spent two years on a guitar subreddit learning 100 different solos. Another described how they’d posted a cookbook of reverse-engineered Panda Express recipes to the delight of other users (though not, apparently, to the delight of Panda Express). Somebody else felt proud of having taught fellow Redditors how to open a box filled with packing peanuts without making a mess. One wrote: “I’ve been helping strangers with their various math questions for over ten years!” Another: “I make people laugh from time to time.”\n\nWhat Reddit does, it turns out, is give people a space that they can create and collectively control, and where they can ask one another question after question after question, in every possible permutation. The place is flooded with expertise and genuine wisdom, and it’s filthy with rabbit holes. But the only two questions that people ever really ask on Reddit, if you think about it, are these: Am I alone? Am I okay? And after all these years, in subreddit after subreddit, no matter what the topic at hand is, the same answers keep coming: You aren’t alone. And you might not be okay. But we’re here.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The biggest compliment I can give Last Breath, a gripping, workmanlike new movie about an undersea rescue, is that I would happily watch a version of it where absolutely nothing goes wrong. The director Alex Parkinson’s debut dramatic film is based on his 2019 documentary of the same name; both recount an incident in the world of “saturation diving,” in which a technician was stranded 300 feet under the North Sea. It’s the kind of intense, rare, do-or-die emergency that’s worthy of a hefty Hollywood feature. But I was mesmerized enough just watching these people do their very odd, high-stakes job.\n\nThe heroes of both Parkinson’s original telling and the feature’s re-creation are Chris Lemons (played by Finn Cole), Duncan Allcock (Woody Harrelson), and David Yuasa (Simu Liu): three deep-sea repairmen whose task is so unthinkably risky and weird, it’s hard to imagine humans actually being able to carry it out. And yet, Parkinson carefully takes viewers through the chipper aplomb with which these men approach their profession. We see them as they’re getting on a large boat in the North Sea, living in a pressurized habitat where they adjust to a helium-rich atmosphere, then hopping into a diving bell to go to the ocean floor and work on the pipes and systems lining it—these mysterious but vital structures that quietly underpin modern life.\n\nThe trio’s occupation feels akin to the experience of traveling to space. They isolate themselves from their families for months on end, relocating to the most hostile environments imaginable. I’ll admit that I’ve spent approximately zero minutes thinking about the giant gas lines and other such superstructures on the ocean floor until now, but once I understood what Last Breath was about, I was locked in. Parkinson’s background as a documentarian serves the movie well; he lays out every aspect of this strange operation for the audience without making his story feel like a Wikipedia entry.\n\nRead: How the diving bell opened the ocean’s depth\n\nLast Breath’s story unfurls in ways that go beyond the simply factual—in large part because of its charming cast. I’m not too familiar with Cole (who is best known for his work on the TV show Peaky Blinders), but he’s appropriately fresh-faced and lively as Lemons, the diving team’s newest member. He’s eager to learn the ropes from Harrelson’s grizzled vet, Allcock; the latter actor can play this kind of wisecracking mentor in his sleep, but he’s a reliably funny dispenser of exposition. As Yuasa, Liu also plays an archetype —the no-nonsense professional—but he keeps the character on the right side of curtness, underlining the extreme professionalism required in such a scary job.\n\nI have no idea how Parkinson captured Last Breath’s underwater footage, which illustrates how dark, treacherous, and almost instantly frightening the deep sea is. This setting is not a place of wonder filled with peculiar flora and fauna, but a gaping, uninviting void. It’s so inhospitable that the presence of big pipes and industrial manifolds comes across as traces left behind by ancient aliens. When Lemons produced a wrench to start tightening some screws, I almost laughed: How could a pipe in such a surreal location be in need of such mundane maintenance?\n\nOf course, things do go wrong, which viewers familiar with the true story know well. A computer error on the ship that the divers are tethered to causes it to drift off course. In the ensuing chaos, Lemons’s guideline (which gives him oxygen, power, and a chain to civilization) snaps, stranding him at the bottom of the ocean; he’s left with just a few minutes of life support. What happens next as his colleagues and other members of the crew try to save him is unimaginable and nerve-racking. But it’s also deeply, mesmerizingly process-oriented.\n\nIt would have been easy to inflate Last Breath’s action stakes to make them fun and absurd, but Parkinson’s nonfiction instincts as a filmmaker won’t really allow for that. I’m thankful for the meticulous realism that follows instead. Entire sequences are devoted to tasks as humdrum as rebooting a ship’s computer (which involves untangling a lot of wires) and shepherding a little robotic sub to try retrieving Lemons, which resembles a very tense version of a fairground claw game. Harrelson and Liu have plenty of movie-star appeal, but the director tends to keep them in stasis; they’re frequently parked in neutral as they figure out the best way back to their friend.\n\nThese scenes shouldn’t be so riveting, but they are—the film makes an effort to invest the audience in the story’s human concerns as much as in its more procedural elements. Last Breath is a midsize version of a large-scale thriller, one that isn’t afraid to seem boring, and I mean that as a major compliment.",

        "title": "What It Takes to Make Shane Gillis Funny",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The moment that Shane Gillis walked onto Saturday Night Live’s stage last night for his second hosting gig, he seemed to know the audience was not on his side.\n\nGillis arrived with history. In 2019, he was hired as a featured cast member but promptly fired after it came to light that he had used racist and homophobic slurs in his podcast. Instead of becoming a footnote in SNL history, Gillis transformed into a successful stand-up with a Netflix deal and a Bud Light ad campaign. About a year ago, he was invited to host SNL for the first time—an appearance in which he awkwardly acknowledged the strangeness of the situation, showing a touch of contrition.\n\nThis time, the tentativeness was mostly gone. After opening with some politically mild, middle-of-the-road jokes—poking fun at both Joe Biden’s age and Donald Trump’s “fifth-grade-level ideas” about trying to annex Greenland—and acknowledging the audience’s likely biases (“You guys are pretty liberal”), he swerved. “Now I’m going to lose you even more,” he said. He launched into a thread about “a thing I’ve noticed that white guys do.” At some point, he said, white guys can’t help asking their girlfriends: Have you ever had sex with a Black guy? Before posing the question, Gillis seemed to attempt to preempt criticism, suggesting that he understood the exoticizing subtext embedded in the question. “It is racist,” he said, gesturing as if to punch anyone who’d dare to say such a thing. He also copped to having asked the question himself. Once, he said, a woman he was dating told him she’d found his friend “Jamal” handsome—after which Gillis worked up the nerve to ask, Have you ever … ? Her response: “Ew, no.” To which he replied, “Jesus Christ, what are you, racist?”\n\nThe twist was meant to absolve Gillis: After saying something racist himself, he found someone even more racist than he was. You might read the joke as Gillis’s attempt to poke fun at himself. But from a pure comedy standpoint, the joke was just basic—and unfunny. (“I’m not the worst of them” is hardly a winning punch line.)\n\nGillis had other groaners. While discussing how much he loves Ken Burns’s documentary series The Civil War, he asserted that “it’s kryptonite to women.” Put it on, he riffed, and they’ll fall asleep instantly. Setting aside that I know plenty of women who like Burns’s work, it’s pretty hard to find anything funny in what Gillis said next: “That’s a little Cosby tip for you.” Translation: If you want to sexually assault a woman—as dozens of women have credibly accused the comedian Bill Cosby of doing (Cosby has denied the allegations)—put on a historical documentary, because it’ll induce women to pass out from boredom.\n\nLike any stand-up, Gillis is playing a part. His happens to be that of the boorish, conservative-leaning white dude. But his monologue fell flat because even when he pretends knowingness, his jokes are ultimately directed to other boorish, conservative-leaning white dudes. He’s not doing anything to really bring the rest of the audience along.\n\nGillis’s act went over better in the context of the night’s sketches. You could see hints of how he might have figured into the show had he stayed on as a full-time cast member. In the parody ad “CouplaBeers,” he portrayed a disaffected suburban office worker who treated his anxiety and depression with a medication that was just, well, a couple of beers. The sketch worked as a takedown of both TV pitches for prescription drugs and the guy who drinks to quell his pain while causing harm to those around him.\n\nSimilarly, Gillis’s persona was well used in “Mid-Day News 2,” a reprisal of a sketch from Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s SNL appearance in 2019. Ego Nwodim and Kenan Thompson once again played Black news anchors who became overjoyed when the alleged perpetrators of the crimes they were reporting on turned out to be white. Gillis and Heidi Gardner played white anchors who got in on a “game” in which the anchors racked up points depending on the crime suspects’ race. The premise worked even better with Gillis than with Waller-Bridge, in part because of Gillis’s history and in part because the sketch offered a bit of social commentary that implicated everyone in the joke.\n\nThat was a key distinction between Gillis the sketch collaborator and Gillis the stand-up. Alone on stage, left to his own devices, he fell into the schtick of being crass for crassness’s sake. When he slipped into fictional character—and allowed SNL’s writers to take the reins—the commentary came closer to hitting its mark, and he finally earned some chuckles.",

        "title": "Where Jeff Bezos Went Wrong With The Washington Post",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The day the world learned that Jeff Bezos would buy The Washington Post, the Amazon founder offered assurances that he would not cower when faced with threats from a vengeful president and his appointees.\n\nHe summoned memories of Richard Nixon’s attorney general, John Mitchell, who warned that the legendary publisher Katharine Graham was “gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer” if the Post published one of its Watergate stories. “While I hope no one ever threatens to put one of my body parts through a wringer,” Bezos wrote to the paper’s anxious journalists in August 2013, “if they do, thanks to Mrs. Graham’s example, I’ll be ready.”\n\nI led the newsroom at the time Bezos bought the Post. For a long while, he fulfilled his promise to the paper and its readers, exceeding my expectations. Then he faltered badly.\n\nNow we know that Bezos is no Katharine Graham. It has been sad and unnerving to watch Bezos fall so terribly short of her standard as he confronts the return of Donald Trump to the White House. It’s been infuriating to observe the damage he has inflicted in recent months on the reputation of a newspaper whose investigative reporting has served as a bulwark against Trump’s most transgressive impulses.\n\nAll the signs lately point to a determined effort by Bezos to either placate Trump or please him outright: quashing an editorial that backed Kamala Harris for president only 11 days before the election and ending a decades-long tradition of presidential endorsements. A gushing postelection message of congratulations to Trump on his “extraordinary political comeback,” with no mention of Trump’s sordid resistance to the peaceful transition of power, which marked a historic low in presidential politics. Having Amazon join other tech companies in donating $1 million to the inauguration fund. Making a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago for a late-night dinner with Trump, where Bezos and Melania Trump discussed a documentary about her—a chat that led to a $40 million licensing deal with Amazon, reportedly nearly three times the offer of the next-highest bidder. Sitting on the dais, as Trump’s showpiece, during the inauguration ceremony. And, last week, a Bezos memo prohibiting any opinion articles in the Post that aren’t aligned with his own ideology of “personal liberties and free markets,” an imperious intervention that caused the editorial-page editor to resign. Trump himself disclosed that he’d dined with Bezos the very evening the Post owner issued his latest dictate.\n\nRead: There are no more red lines\n\nHundreds of thousands of readers have canceled subscriptions, no longer confident that this great newspaper will keep faith with the mission implicit in its motto of “Democracy dies in darkness.” Many of the Post’s talented journalists have decamped to other media outlets, unsure of their paper’s strategy and its soul.\n\nThankfully, the news department continues to operate with admirable independence and vigor, delivering revelatory work about a second Trump administration. That makes it all the more dismaying to witness the Post’s public image repeatedly tarnished as its owner cozies up to Trump with the evident goal of avoiding the president’s wrath and winning his favor.\n\nFor more than a decade, it looked as if Bezos would defy the worst expectations of him as a media owner. He did the right thing, surprisingly and encouragingly. I highlighted his many instances of steadfastness and courage in the 2023 book I wrote about my eight-year tenure as the Post’s executive editor, which overlapped with Bezos’s ownership and the first iteration of Trump in the White House. “In all my interactions with him,” I recounted, “Bezos showed himself to have integrity and spine.”\n\nHe oversaw an editorial page that unflinchingly, and with just cause, called Trump “bigoted, ignorant, deceitful, narcissistic, vengeful, petty, misogynistic, fiscally reckless, intellectually lazy, contemptuous of democracy and enamored of America’s enemies.” That was in a 2016 presidential endorsement of Hillary Clinton. In 2020, the Post’s editorial page opposed his reelection, labeling him “the worst president of modern times.” After Trump’s triumph in 2016, many of us at the Post worried that Bezos would capitulate to Trump’s bullying as he acquired the fearsome powers of a president. And yet, Bezos allayed our concerns. He fully supported our news coverage, giving us complete journalistic independence. Never once did he interfere, even when stories provoked Trump to retaliate against Amazon and him personally. I admired that, and remain immensely grateful.\n\n“Don’t worry about me,” he told the political staff. “I can take care of myself.” I recall him musing later, in a dinner we had with leaders of The New York Times, how someday we might have to march together in protest if Trump’s attacks on journalists endangered the constitutional right to a free and independent press.\n\nWith the passage of time, it’s easy to forget how often Bezos was viciously denounced by Trump over the course of his first presidential campaign and first term as president. With Bezos pegged as a political enemy solely because of the Post’s coverage, Trump pressed to raise postal rates for package deliveries, vowing, depending on the day, to double, triple, or quadruple rates paid by Amazon. He interfered in a $10 billion cloud-computing contract for the Department of Defense with the goal of ensuring that it didn’t go to Amazon, which had been perceived to be the leading bidder. He endlessly, and falsely, taunted Bezos with accusations that he was using the “Amazon Washington Post” to lobby for government favors and avoid taxes. He mocked Bezos’s divorce and his extramarital affair, ridiculing him as “Jeff Bozo.”\n\nJoshua Benton: Jeff Bezos’s hypocritical assertion of power\n\nAgainst those attacks and others, Bezos pushed back. In May 2016, I interviewed him at a conference held in the Post’s Washington, D.C., headquarters. I gave his staff a heads-up that I would ask about Trump’s broadsides against him, and for the first time, Bezos addressed them. “Most of the world’s population,” Bezos said, “live in countries where, if you criticize the leader, you can go to jail. We live in the oldest and greatest democracy in the world, with the strongest free-speech protections in the world, and it’s something that we are, I think, rightly proud of … We want a society where any of us, any individual in this country, any institution in this country, if they choose to, can scrutinize, examine, and criticize an elected official, especially a candidate for the highest office in the most powerful country on Earth.”\n\nIn a 2018 interview with the financier and philanthropist David Rubenstein, Bezos spoke out forcefully and eloquently against Trump’s assault on the press: “If you’re the president of the United States or a governor of a state or whatever, you don’t take that job thinking you’re not going to get scrutinized. You’re going to get scrutinized, and it’s healthy … It’s dangerous to call the media lowlifes. It’s dangerous to say that they’re the enemy of the people.” He commended the work I was doing as the Post’s editor in charge of news coverage and that of Fred Hiatt, who oversaw editorials and opinions. In slang expressing unreserved approval, and to robust applause in a cavernous ballroom, he said we were “killing it.”\n\nBezos also made the gutsy legal request to have Trump deposed over the loss of the Defense Department contract. “The question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends,” Amazon’s lawyers wrote in late 2019. “President Trump’s animosity toward Mr. Bezos, Amazon, and the Washington Post is well known, and it originates at least in part from his dissatisfaction with the Washington Post’s coverage of him from before he assumed office.”\n\nYou no longer hear tough words like that from Bezos and his camp. At least as striking as his recent, highly publicized overtures to Trump is his drastic shift to highly accommodating language.\n\nWhen Bezos spoke in December at the Times’ DealBook conference, it was as if he were a different person. He looked different, more buff. He sounded different, more meek. There was no expression of appreciation for the Post’s coverage, nor anything about the importance of the Post or the media generally—only his intent to try to talk Trump “out of that idea” that the press is the enemy of the people. “I don’t think he’s going to see it the same way,” he added, elaborating a bit on that minimalist goal. “But maybe I’ll be wrong.” (Predictably, he was wrong—spectacularly so.) And then Bezos assessed that Trump was “calmer than he was the first time” and “more settled.” Bezos could not have believed the words he uttered.\n\nJeff Bezos sits next to U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Kimberly Thune (second left) during the luncheon following President Donald Trump’s inauguration at the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty)\n\nGeorge Packer: The Washington Post is dying a death of despair\n\nThe big question is why Bezos’s language and behavior have changed so dramatically. I can’t get into Bezos’s head, of course, but one answer must lie in an indisputable fact: Trump is less calm, less settled, and far more vindictive. He campaigned for office pledging retribution against “the enemy from within”—in other words, anyone who opposed him. In August 2023, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU.” By October of last year, NPR had counted 100 instances of Trump threatening to prosecute or punish political enemies.\n\nBezos has ample reason to worry about the consequences of any retribution. Federal contracts are key to the success of Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division that has been delivering more than half of the company’s profits. An arch-competitor is Oracle, whose founder and chairman is Larry Ellison, the GOP megadonor whom Trump hosted recently at the White House and extolled as “one of the most serious players anywhere in the world.” Bezos’s commercial space venture, Blue Origin, has received billions of dollars from his personal bank account. January’s successful launch into orbit of its New Glenn rocket positions Blue Origin to finally compete with Space X, the pacesetter owned by Trump’s seemingly omnipotent best buddy, Elon Musk. The government will be Blue Origin’s essential customer.\n\nYou don’t have to look far to see what might happen to businesses in Trump’s crosshairs. Solely because the top-tier law firm of Covington & Burling represents the former special counsel Jack Smith, Trump stripped its attorneys of national-security clearances and ordered federal agencies to cancel the firm’s federal contracts. Smith had received pro bono assistance in anticipation of retributive investigations and prosecution by Trump’s Justice Department. The president, who had sworn only a month earlier to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution, aimed to damage a law firm for work that is guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment’s promise of access to counsel.\n\nNewspaper owners have every right to set their paper’s overall direction, and opinions expressed in editorials—or whether to publish any at all—have always been their prerogative. In a note to readers this past October, Bezos argued that calling for a halt to presidential endorsements would help avoid a “perception of bias” and a “perception of nonindependence.” He framed it as an effort to restore reader trust, which has sharply declined for the media. “We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility,” he wrote.\n\nSetting aside whether a presidential endorsement every four years truly weighs more heavily in readers’ perceptions of bias than the daily editorials on sharply polarizing subjects, Bezos’s own behavior since that decision has undercut his stated goals. Appearing on the dais during Trump’s inauguration did not look like working harder to increase the Post’s credibility. Nor did it signal independence. Instead, it suggested dependence on Donald Trump. Bezos denies that fear of retaliation against his other commercial interests had anything to do with the endorsement decision. “That was certainly not on my mind,” he told the Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook conference. That strains belief.\n\n“We saved The Washington Post once. This will be the second time,” Bezos said during the DealBook interview. “It took a couple of years. It made money for six or seven years after that. In the last few years, it’s lost money again. It needs to be put back on a good footing again … We have a few other ideas.”\n\nThe opinion section’s Bezos-mandated pivot to “personal liberties and free markets” appears to be one of them. Bezos is right that his previous strategy for turning the Post into a national news organization was a grand success, and I was glad to execute it as my fellow journalists and I contributed good ideas of our own and scotched some really bad ones. This latest turn seems less promising, not to mention less inspiring. Will readers drawn to the Post outnumber those who lose confidence in it?\n\nRead: The tech oligarchy arrives\n\nWhat’s especially worrisome about Bezos’s instructions is the mandate that alternative views are unwelcome—“left to be published by others.” And neither Bezos nor the Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, has defined what precisely is meant by “personal liberties and free markets,” identified what sorts of opinions would be considered nonconforming, or addressed how this might affect the reputations of columnists who remain on staff. Who exactly in the opinion section has been against personal liberties? Will opinions in favor of regulation (of major tech platforms, for example) not be tolerated? Will it be allowable to speak of instances where markets have failed or gone awry? If columnists take a free-market view, won’t readers conclude that they’re doing so only because they’re required to as a condition of employment?\n\nLewis, in a note to staff, celebrated the “recalibrated content strategy” for offering “new clarity and transparency.” But Post columnists tell me they have no clue what it foretells and whether they’ll fit in. They’ve asked for explanations from the owner and the publisher, and been met with silence. Opacity, not transparency, appears to be the order of the day.\n\nThe White House and its allies, in contrast, didn’t seem confused at all about what was in the offing. Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, responded to the edict by posting a GIF of a typically grumpy Grinch cracking a smile. Elon Musk promptly blasted out, “Bravo, @JeffBezos!” The right-wing activist Charlie Kirk cheered, “Good! The culture is changing rapidly for the better.” None of them worried that Bezos’s directive constituted what they claim to abhor (and what it is): cancel culture.\n\nThe most fundamental American liberty is free expression. Newspapers such as the Post have long honored that constitutional right by welcoming a wide range of views in the opinion section, whether their leadership agrees with them or not, so as to encourage civil public debate. Bezos was now decreeing that views out of alignment with his own ideology would not see the light of day in territory that he controls. The paper that proclaims itself to be on the side of democracy had taken a step that was distinctly undemocratic.\n\nAs of today, the Post’s editorials continue to take Trump to task. After Friday’s quarrelsome White House meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Post judged that Trump “sounded more like Don Corleone than an American president.” In the months ahead, we’ll see if a reconfigured opinion section censures the president for his abject failure to practice what Bezos preaches.\n\nTrump and the modern Republican Party are anything but models of free-market principle. An affection for punitive tariffs is but one example. The incessant bullying of private enterprise to serve Trump’s political interests is yet another, as Bezos knows from personal experience. “In today’s Republican Party,” the Post columnist Catherine Rampell has written, “the primary economic role of the state is not to get out of the way. It is, instead, to reward friends and crush political enemies.”\n\nFrom the March 2025 issue: Capitulation is contagious\n\nAs for personal liberties, it’s difficult to imagine a greater hazard than Trump, a man who speaks admiringly of the world’s dictators. He asserts unprecedented presidential powers and has demonstrated disdain for the rule of law. He is using the federal government as a weapon against his political adversaries, withdrawing security protection from former officials who have crossed him and threatening prosecution of those he deems to have persecuted him. High on the list of targets is the press, a regular object of harassment, intimidation, investigation, litigation, and condemnation, with the goal of further undermining public trust and sabotaging economic sustainability.\n\nIf the Post does its job correctly in both its opinion section and its news coverage, it will hold Trump fully accountable when he engages in deceit and as he continues to subvert this country’s democratic institutions. It will report what Trump is seeking to conceal but what the public deserves to know. That, at some point, will make the Post a fresh target for malevolent and punishing attacks. Amazon and Blue Origin might well be in the line of fire too, and Bezos’s postelection outreach to Trump is unlikely to count for much amid his fury.\n\nAs Bezos decides how to respond, I urge him to make one of his rare visits to the Post’s newsroom and stare at the wall where its nearly century-old principles are affixed, paying attention to two in particular. No. 1: “The first mission of a newspaper is to tell the truth as nearly as the truth may be ascertained.” And then No. 5: “The newspaper’s duty is to its readers and to the public at large, and not to the private interests of its owners.”",

        "content": "What Does a Robot With a Soul Sound Like?\n\nSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nThe movie The Wild Robot features a robot with a quality that, in a different context, would put the audience on alert: an operating system that can convincingly mimic falling in love. The story launches with an accident. Roz, a helper unit, lands on an uninhabited island when a Universal Dynamics cargo ship carrying crates of fellow robots crashes. While running away from a bear, she crushes a goose nest and kills all the birds except one. Raising the gosling, Brightbill, becomes her task, and so Roz has to learn to be a mother. The movie is technically classified as sci-fi, but this is not Her or Westworld. It’s an animated film based on a children’s book, which means the storyline of a robot developing a soul lands softly.\n\nThis year, The Wild Robot was nominated for an Oscar in sound design, maybe because the movie managed Roz’s growing emotions in such a novel and delicate way. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with Randy Thom, the director of sound design at Skywalker Sound and the supervising sound designer on The Wild Robot, about how he and his team helped to create the sound of Roz’s voice and movements. Thom explains how he manipulated the voice of Lupita Nyong’o, who voiced the robot, so she slowly sounded less robotic and more maternal. And how he invented a way to literally breathe life into Roz.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nHanna Rosin: Hey. It’s Hanna, again. So last year, we did an episode with the sound designer behind The Zone of Interest, which ended up winning the Oscar for Best Sound. We thought we’d do a similar episode with one of this year’s nominated films, which is the bonus episode you’re about to hear. Enjoy.\n\nRoz: Hello. Bonjour. Guten Tag. Jambo. Hola. Congratulations on your purchase of a Universal Dynamics robot.\n\nRosin: That is the voice of Roz from the animated film The Wild Robot, up for three Oscars this weekend, including for Best Sound.\n\nRoz, who’s voiced by Lupita Nyong’o, is a helper robot: a kind of turbocharged Siri who gets stranded on a deserted island and learns to communicate with the animals that live there.\n\nShe also finds a goose egg—the only one left after she accidentally destroyed its nest—and she decides that her task is to raise this gosling and basically become its mom. But that means she has to do all the parts of becoming a mom.\n\nFink: But she remembers one thing: you. And when she finally sees you, she feels— Roz: Crushing obligation. Fink: —very lucky to be a mother. Brightbill: Mama.\n\nRosin: This all created an interesting challenge for the movie’s sound-design team, which is: What should this robot sound like? And what should it sound like if it has a soul?\n\nRoz: How do you know if you love something, someone? Fink: If you do, you should probably tell them. Roz: What if it is too late?\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin.\n\nToday we’re talking about how a movie handles our complicated feelings about robots, with the guy who had to figure that out in sound—\n\nRandy Thom: My name is Randy Thom.\n\nRosin: —and who did it well enough to get an Oscar nomination.\n\nThom: And I’m the supervising sound designer on The Wild Robot.\n\nRosin: There is a long history of robots in film, from him:\n\nC-3PO: Here he comes.\n\n\n\n[Sounds from Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope]\n\nRosin: To him:\n\nWall-E: Wall-E. Eve: Wall-E. Wall-E: Ohhh.\n\nRosin: To Her:\n\nSamantha: Hello? I’m here. Theodore: What do I call you? Do you have a name? Samantha: Yes. Samantha.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: And Randy and The Wild Robot filmmakers knew they had to include some element of that classic robot feel for Roz’s voice, like a little bit of monotone:\n\nThom: If I were to say, Let me adjust this microphone, and then we decide we want to flatten it, it would be: Let me adjust this microphone. (Voice distorts mechanically.) Rosin: Ah. That was pretty good. Thom: So it’s all kind of one note.\n\nRosin: And then some extra processing in the voice.\n\nThom: As good an example as any would be C-3PO.\n\nOwen Lars: Can you speak Bocce? C-3PO: Of course I can, sir. It’s like a second language to me. I’m— Lars: All right. Shut up. I’ll take this one. C-3PO: Shutting up, sir.\n\nThom: His voice, when C-3PO was speaking English, was processed quite noticeably in terms of restricting its bandwidth, so it sounds a little bit like you’re hearing it over a telephone. It doesn’t have many low frequencies in it or extremely high frequencies.\n\nC-3PO: What makes you think there are settlements over there? [R2-D2 beeps] C-3PO: Don’t get technical with me. [R2-D2 beeps]\n\nThom: There’s this thing called “audio phasing,” where a signal, a sound gets combined with itself but slightly out of sync with itself, and it makes this kind of swishing sound. And so a little bit of that is typically added to a voice to make it sound a little more like a robot.\n\nC-3PO: I’ve just about had enough of you. Go that way. You’ll be malfunctioning within a day, you near-sighted scrap pile.\n\nRosin: By the way, Randy would know all of this because—\n\nThom: I’m the director of sound design at Skywalker Sound. Are you looking for that kind of title?\n\n[Star Wars theme song]\n\nRosin: I mean, if you had that title, would you ever introduce yourself in any other way?\n\nAnyway, back to Roz and The Wild Robot.\n\nThom: One of the things that Gary Rizzo, the dialogue mixer on the film, did, I think, to very useful effect was to dial up a reverberation algorithm that makes it sound like her voice is inside a metal container.\n\nRoz: Congratulations on your purchase of a Universal Dynamics robot. I am Rozzum 7134.\n\nThom: And the effect of it, if you use that kind of processing subtly enough—\n\nRoz: Congratulations on your purchase of a Universal Dynamics robot.\n\nThom: —is that it feels like you’re hearing her metallic body resonate when she speaks. Rosin: Whoa.\n\nRoz: I am Rozzum 7134. A Rozzum always completes its task. Just ask.\n\nThom: We did initially think that there might be quite a bit of robotizing of Lupita’s voice. But the more we tried that, the more we realized that we really need this character to express emotion, because what’s kind of going on in the story is that this robot develops a soul.\n\nRummage: Can you explain again what we are doing? Roz: I don’t know! I’m just making stuff up! I don’t know what I’m doing. And I have to! I have to because he’s relying on me!\n\nThom: And so what you hear in the film is something that does sound very much like a robot for the first six or eight things that she utters.\n\nRoz: Was this task accomplished to your satisfaction? Brightbill: (Screams.)\n\nThom: But then, fairly quickly, we dial out the processing, and so that what you’re left with is Lupita’s performance as a robot.\n\nRoz: They cut my power, but I still heard you because I was listening with a different part of myself.\n\nRosin: Now, of course, Roz is not the only robot. You voiced a robot in Wild Robot. You play essentially the equivalent of a Stormtrooper—like, the bad-muscle robot. Thom: That’s right. Rosin: How did you think about those robots differently? Thom: Well, this is a case where my big, bassy voice was useful. These are very large, you know, military robots. And so I just tried to manifest that as well as I could.\n\nVONTRA: Your target is Rozzum 7134. RECO: Deploy.\n\nThom: But even my voice needed to be augmented to make it sound even bigger. And so I pitched my voice down almost an octave—\n\nRECO: You do not belong here. This is a wilderness.\n\nThom: —and put some of that kind of metallic reverberation on it. Rosin: Mm-hmm. RECO: You do not belong here. This is a wilderness.\n\nThom: And I just needed to perform it in as, kind of, aggressive and intimidating a way as I could muster. Rosin: Okay. Give us one line. I’m trying to imagine your voice an octave deeper than I’m listening to. Thom: (Laughs.) Yeah. I won’t be able to simulate that part of it. “This is a wilderness. You do not belong here.” Rosin: (Laughs.) That was excellent. Thom: (Laughs.) Rosin: That was excellent. Thom: Well, thank you.\n\nRoz: I’m already home. Thank you. RECO: You do not belong here. This is a wilderness. Roz: And I am a wild robot.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: When we come back: Randy has a breakthrough.\n\nThom: Damn! That’s going to work.\n\nRosin: That’s coming up.\n\n[Break]\n\nRosin: So one thing Randy Thom had to figure out is what Roz’s voice would sound like. But he also had to figure out how Roz would sound when she moved: like, when she’d twisted her body or extended her arm, and when she walked around.\n\nThom: The tradition for doing robot movement sounds for movies is to use recordings of servo motors.\n\n[Sounds of servo motors]\n\nThom: A servo motor is a kind of electric motor that’s often used in robots. And the sound that it makes—when the robot walks—is sort of … (Mimics sound.)\n\n[Sounds of servo motors]\n\nThom: Sounds like that were used in the Star Wars films. R2-D2 really rolls, rather than walks, but C-3PO is anthropomorphic, has arms and legs. And you hear servo motors when C-3PO walks.\n\n[Music]\n\nC-3PO: He tricked me into going this way. But he’ll do no better.\n\nThom: So that approach had been done well. But at this point, it seemed like a bit of a cliche, and so I wanted to stay away from it for that reason. But probably the more important reason I wanted to not use servo motors is that Roz is supposed to be very high-tech, so she had to sound elegant and smooth and subtle when she moved.\n\nRoz: Rozzums are programmed for instant physical mimicry.\n\nThom: So I started listening to pneumatic systems. And in a pneumatic system, air under pressure is used to propel certain kinds of things. And as I listened to those, I was thinking, Wow. Yeah. That’s going to work. Something like that’s going to work.\n\n[Sounds from The Wild Robot]\n\nRosin: And what does a pneumatic system sound like? I actually tried to YouTube yesterday “pneumatic systems,” and mostly what you see is video images. But I couldn’t find one that had any kind of elegant sound. Thom: Well, they’re often something like … (Mimics sound.) That sort of thing.\n\n[Sounds from The Wild Robot]\n\nRosin: Oh. That’s what a pneumatic system is. It’s, like, a tube going through a thing, is how we associate it. Thom: Yeah. If you can imagine a kind of cylinder being pushed through a tube— Rosin: Yeah. Okay. Thom: —that has air in it, and what you’re hearing is the air escaping around the edges of the cylinder inside the tube, it’s like that.\n\n[Sounds from The Wild Robot]\n\nThom: The more I listened to those sounds and edited them to be in sync with Roz’s movements on the screen, the more it occurred to me that they were a little like breathing. So I decided to try actual breath sounds—inhales and exhales—not for Roz breathing, because she doesn’t breathe, but for her movement sounds, for her walking. So every time she would take a step, you would hear this … (Mimics sound.) That sort of thing.\n\n[Sounds from The Wild Robot]\n\nThom: And so I performed some of the breaths. Rosin: Were they slow, like meditation-yoga-class breaths? Or what kind of breaths? Thom: Well, it depends a little on what she’s doing. There’s one moment early in the film where she reaches into a cave that a bear—who’s voiced by Mark Hamill of Star Wars, by the way. Rosin: Mm-hmm. Thom: She reaches into this cave, and her arm has to extend quite a distance.\n\n[Sounds from The Wild Robot]\n\nThom: I had to do a fairly long breath for that arm movement, so it was like … (Mimics sound.) And I have to be careful that I don’t pass out from doing that too much. (Laughs.) Rosin: Right. (Laughs.)\n\n[Sounds from The Wild Robot]\n\nThom: But the trick, of course, is to do it subtly enough so that it doesn’t literally sound like breathing. And so we don’t want the audience to think, We’re hearing her breathing as she’s walking. It has to be quiet enough so that it’s mostly subliminal.\n\n[Sounds from The Wild Robot]\n\nRosin: You know what’s philosophically—as you’re talking, the symbolism of this, of breathing life into the robot, is very interesting, you know? Thom: Yeah. That’s the little light bulb that got turned on in my head once I started listening to these breath sounds. So for me, it was probably the most fun activity that I had working on the film, figuring out a new kind of paradigm for robot movement.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: In his past work, Randy has figured out sounds for much bigger—and less, shall we say, aerodynamic—kinds of robots, like The Iron Giant.\n\nThom: Well, I did use some servo sounds for the movement of The Iron Giant, which is an animated film.\n\nHogarth Hughes: See this? This is called a rock. Rock. Iron Giant: Rock.\n\nThom: But I also used some hydraulic sounds for that giant robot.\n\nHughes: Yes. Iron Giant: Rock? Hughes: No, no. That is a tree.\n\nRosin: Early in his career, Randy also helped to come up with the sound for an even bigger kind of robot, which he found in recordings of a huge metal shear—think: like, a metal guillotine.\n\nThom: And it made this really great multisyllabic, syncopated sound, so it made this sort of … (Mimics sound.) And that’s the sound that the Imperial Walkers make in The Empire Strikes Back.\n\n[Sounds from Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back] Person 1: Echo station 3TA, we have spotted Imperial Walkers. Person 2: Imperial Walkers on the north bridge.\n\nRosin: So you’re moving essentially from something that is metallic, to something that is a little more organic, to something that feels fairly humanlike. That does feel like an evolution. Thom: Yeah, I think it is. Rosin: Do you have a sense now, after working on Wild Robot, what an ideal robot would sound like? Like, do you think we could ever go back to the days when robots sounded metallic? Or are we just living in a world where our expectation is that robots have a humanish feel of some kind? Thom: I don’t think we’re there yet. It depends, in movies, of course—so if you see a robot in Her—\n\nSamantha: Was that funny? Theodore: Yeah. Samantha: Oh, good. I’m funny.\n\nThom: —then you certainly don’t expect to hear, you know, servo motors.\n\n[Sounds of servo motors]\n\nThom: But if there’s a kind of retro look to the robot, then I can certainly imagine a movie being made next year where it would be appropriate to go back to servo motors. Rosin: Right. So we’re not firmly in the era of the humanoid robot. Who knows how it could go? Thom: Yeah. Rosin: We could start having nostalgia for the robot robot as we knew it. Thom: I’m sure we will. Rosin: Yeah. One day.\n\n[Sounds from Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back] C-3PO: And you’re having delusions of grandeur. [R2-D2 beeps]\n\nRosin: Well, thank you so much for joining us and for explaining this so patiently. I really appreciate it. Thom: Oh, it was my pleasure. Nice to talk with you.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Jinae West and edited by Claudine Ebeid.

        "content": "One recent morning on Chicago’s southwest side, the manager of a Mexican grocery store began the day posted at the front door, rehearsing the phrase “I wish to exercise my right to remain silent” in English in case immigration agents showed up asking about employees.\n\nAt a Mexican restaurant, the owner stashed newly laminated private signs under the host stand, ready to slap on the walls of the kitchen and a back dining room where workers could hide if agents arrived without a proper warrant.\n\nInside a house nearby, a woman named Consuelo went to the living-room window and checked the street for unusual cars, then checked the time as her undocumented husband left for work, calculating when he was supposed to arrive at the suburban country club where he’d worked for 27 years, where he’d earned an “all-star” employee award, and which now felt like enemy territory. She lit the first prayer candle of the day.\n\nA month into President Donald Trump’s promise to launch the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, this is what life was becoming in a neighborhood where generations of Mexican immigrants had built versions of American lives: People were in various stages of preparing for a crackdown that felt more imminent every day.\n\nAlthough much of the controversy around immigration has focused on the southern border and recent waves of asylum seekers from Venezuela, Haiti, and Central America, anxiety over Trump’s deportation plan is seeping into the nation’s more long-standing population of undocumented immigrants. Experts estimate that at least 11 million people are in the United States without legal status, about 4 million of whom are Mexicans, many with deep roots in cities and towns across a nation whose central hypocrisy has long been to use the cheap labor that immigrants supply, while often demonizing them for political expedience.\n\nRead: The deportation show\n\nSince Trump returned to office last month, his administration has claimed that it is rounding up immigrants with violent criminal backgrounds, though little information has been released about detainees so far. During the first two weeks of his current term, more than 8,000 people were arrested, including more than 100 in the Chicago area, a number roughly in line with enforcement surges in the past. What mattered more was the ever more dire message people were hearing.\n\nTrump was no longer simply using terms such as “bloodthirsty criminals” and “animals” to describe immigrants. In a barrage of militaristic propaganda and executive orders, he was declaring them to be enemies and spies, and the situation at the southern border an “invasion.” His border czar, Tom Homan, was calling bystanders swept up in raids “collaterals,” the blithe euphemism for civilians killed in wars. Trump was preparing to designate foreign drug cartels and gangs as “terrorists,” and pledging to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which could give the administration extraordinary wartime powers to bypass due process and accelerate deportations. U.S. forces were building a tent city at Guantánamo Bay. Before being repatriated, a group of Venezuelan detainees had been held at a prison that once housed al-Qaeda suspects. In recent days, Trump was reportedly growing impatient with the pace of deportations, reassigning his acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And hour by hour, all of this was filtering into the social-media feeds and WhatsApp groups of people trying to figure out what was going to happen next.\n\nRead: The ‘right way’ to immigrate just went wrong\n\n“It’s the rhetoric; it’s the dehumanization; it’s the narrative of what Trump is making people think about us,” Eréndira Rendón, an immigrant-rights advocate in Chicago, told me. She herself had been brought to the U.S. as a child, and her legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was uncertain. “It feels more intense this time,” Rendón said, comparing the moment with previous crackdowns during Trump’s first term, and during the Obama administration before that. “Like there is no going back.”\n\nThat feeling was widespread in southwest Chicago, where dozens of people told me that they had no choice but to take Trump’s rhetoric seriously. The level of anxiety was such that almost no one wanted their name used, or their specific location mentioned, for fear of attracting the attention of immigration agents. The people I spoke with included restaurant workers, shopkeepers, meatpackers, construction workers, lawyers, a graphic designer, a teacher, and parents of American children, some of whom were attending a “Know Your Rights” seminar in the back of a public library one night.\n\n“You should memorize your alien number,” an advocate named Laura was saying, referring to a number assigned to track noncitizens. “It starts with the letter A and is nine digits. This is how your loved ones will be able to find you.”\n\nBy the first week in February, life on the southwest side had entered a kind of limbo. In the days before Trump’s inauguration, several people told me, they had stockpiled food. Now the streets were quiet. School attendance was down. Attendance was down at a Catholic church that had welcomed immigrants for generations. “We are preparing for the worst,” the priest there told me; he requested anonymity to avoid drawing scrutiny to a place he was trying to keep safe.\n\nHe had tried to reassure people of this, even though the Trump administration had just rescinded a policy protecting places of worship, schools, and other sensitive locations from immigration raids. The priest had promised that he was not going to fling open the front doors for agents, even though Trump was threatening to prosecute anyone interfering with enforcement. He’d done the only other thing he knew to do: On a table just inside the heavy wooden front doors of his church, he’d set out a stack of pamphlets with hotlines and names of lawyers who could help people sign over belongings, transfer home titles, establish guardians for children.\n\nOutside, the steeple rose above a neighborhood of rowhouses and battered mailboxes with one name taped or painted over another—Ariza, Arevalo, Ramirez. In the past two years, thousands of Venezuelan migrants had arrived, but the dominant immigrant community was composed of Mexicans, many of whom had arrived in the 1990s after NAFTA sent a flood of subsidized U.S. corn across the border, decimating small farmers. At this point, lives were settled. The names and images of Mexican heroes and saints were chiseled on schools and framed on walls—Benito Juárez, Cesar Chavez, Óscar Romero, a thousand Virgins of Guadalupe. A commercial strip was packed with Western Unions, taquerias, and shops named for Mexican towns. A photography studio had sun-faded images of weddings propped in the window. Businesses were open, but many of their front doors were locked.\n\nThere had been reports of a man detained in an adjacent neighborhood, and rumors of ICE trucks patrolling. At a clothing store, the owners, a married couple, buzzed people in only after screening them. In came a delivery guy wearing a face mask. In came the undocumented man who lived above the shop. A portable television on a glass counter was blaring something about Trump. “This man is crazy,” the husband was saying.\n\nHe and his wife both told me that they had legal status, but worried that Trump was taking away protections for whole categories of immigrants. Their three grandchildren were born in the U.S., but Trump was trying to abolish birthright citizenship. Besides the man who lived upstairs, a daughter-in-law who lived with them was undocumented, which made the shop owners possible “collaterals,” and so they were saving money for lawyers. They were considering selling the business, and imagining what might be left for them back in Guanajuato, Mexico, after 28 years away.\n\nEveryone had some plan. A couple decided that if one of them got picked up, the other would signal trouble by texting random letters.\n\nAt a restaurant, the cashier’s strategy was to stay inside except for work. “I don’t walk my dog. I don’t do laundry. I canceled my doctor,” she told me. She was in the process of establishing residency but had little confidence this would save her. She’d given her lawyer’s number to a friend. “If they come, I cannot start running,” she said.\n\nDown the street, the grocery-store manager had gone over a plan with workers. If immigration agents came, employees were to calmly walk to areas designated as private, where agents were not supposed to go without a specific judicial warrant: up a spiral staircase to an office; behind the meat counter. A back door was open. The owner had recorded a video message as if preparing them for battle. “Your strength inspires us all,” he said. “We are with you.”\n\nAt the public library, people took notes as Laura, the advocate, explained about alien numbers, and which rights undocumented immigrants still had in America.\n\n“You have a right to be silent, but you have to say so,” she said. “Say: ‘I wish to remain silent,’” she told them, and they repeated the phrase. She continued: You have a right to refuse to sign anything. You have a right to refuse to open your door, or to open it only a few inches; any wider could be interpreted as permission to enter. You should know the difference between an administrative warrant and a judicial warrant, and insist that the officer slip it under the door or press it against a window. You should know what to expect if a warrant is valid.\n\n“They might break down the door,” Laura said, telling people not to panic if that happened, not to run, which could make the situation turn violent.\n\nA woman raised her hand. “If they are looking for someone who used to live in this place before, can they enter?”\n\n“Let them know they don’t live there anymore, but it is up to them to believe you,” Laura said.\n\n“If I’m not at home, but my kid is, can they enter?” came another question. Laura explained that if the child says their mother or father isn’t home, agents might not accept it. “They can enter because they will think the child can lie,” she said.\n\nShe continued: Do provide ICE agents with your date of birth. Do familiarize yourself with locations of detention facilities. The nearest are in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Kentucky.\n\n“How long is the process to get people back?” someone asked.\n\n“It depends,” Laura said, explaining how the detention process could go.\n\n“Your cellphone is going to be taken away,” she said, handing out pamphlets. “You will have to request to make phone calls.”\n\nIf due process is followed, she said, you get to contact your lawyer. If you are eligible for bond, it is $6,000 on average. And if you make bond, your case joins a backlog of 3.5 million cases, built up over decades. “It could take years,” she said.\n\nIf you are unable to prove that you’ve been in the country longer than two years, though, due process may no longer apply, Laura said. She explained that Trump had recently expanded a policy called expedited removal that used to apply only to border areas but now applied to the whole country. In theory, you could be transferred directly to a waiting airplane, Laura said, advising people to start carrying old utility bills or leases to prove long-term residency.\n\nShe continued for a while, advising people not to carry any documents that would identify them as a citizen of Mexico or any foreign country. She warned that immigration agents might be driving any kind of car, or wearing any kind of clothes, and that the situation was fluid. The old rules could change any day.\n\n“It’s hard to know what is going to happen,” she said. “It’s hard to plan.”\n\nPeople exchanged phone numbers, and when the session was over, Laura did what she has been doing most nights since Trump’s inauguration, which was to pick up her undocumented father from the restaurant where he worked, sleep a few hours, and then start another day of Know Your Rights seminars. She had given dozens all over the city. Homan, Trump’s border czar, was calling such events “How to Escape Arrest” seminars.\n\n“Sanctuary cities are making it very difficult to arrest the criminals,” he’d said on CNN. “For instance, Chicago, very well educated. They’ve been educated how to defy ICE, how to hide from ICE.”\n\nChicago activists took this as a minor victory; the city had a long and proud history of immigrant-rights advocacy, and had often set the tone for how activists around the country would handle federal crackdowns. A veteran immigrant-rights advocate named Omar Lopez, who had been involved in the cause since the early 1960s, told me that he believed this was one reason Chicago was among the Trump administration’s first targets.\n\n“I think they wanted to see how Chicago would respond,” Lopez said. His organization was planning work stoppages and boycotts in the months ahead.\n\nBut one month into the Trump administration, he and others worried that the barrage of propaganda casting detainees as “criminals” and “the worst of the worst” was taking hold, stifling protest, even though federal authorities had released little information about who was actually being detained. No one wanted to be perceived as standing up for criminals.\n\n“Once that idea takes hold, we’ve lost the narrative,” Rendón said.\n\nThere were rumors that the organizations such as the one where Laura worked were going to be targeted next, which the leaders took seriously enough that they told all their employees to stay home for a few days. Homan had floated the idea of prosecuting Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, for spearheading a similar effort in her district. Even hardened attorneys understood that legal challenges would not necessarily stop a Trump administration determined to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Those challenges were mostly based on due-process rights; ultimately, the president had the power to pursue an aggressive deportation policy.\n\n“People are saying to me, ‘Aren’t you going to stop this?’ Well, no, we’re not going to stop all of it in court, because deporting people who are here illegally is not, per se, unlawful,” Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who argued the challenge to the family-separation policy and other high-profile cases during Trump’s first administration, told me. “The immigration laws are incredibly harsh. The only way this is going to be stopped is if the American public rejects it.”\n\nFrom the September 2023 issue: An American catastrophe\n\nBut there has been no large-scale rejection, not yet, and in many corners of Trump-supporting America, people have been cheering him on. For now, there was the quiet of a neighborhood where people were memorizing alien numbers, locking doors, and hiding inside houses, including one where the curtains were drawn on a bright afternoon and a cooler full of stockpiled food sat on the front stoop.\n\nInside, Consuelo was waiting for her husband to return to the home they’d bought with money from his job as a busboy, waiter, and bartender at the country club, and from her jobs at a shampoo factory, a metal-shelf factory, a frozen-food factory, and a florist, and stuffing envelopes on the night shift. The rest was their American life: photos of two American-born children on a piano, a box of dried mangoes on top of the refrigerator, a Virgin of Guadalupe on a kitchen wall, crucifixes in the living room, and so many saints and prayer candles these days that Consuelo’s son complained that they lived in a church.\n\nHe was 21, and she had been busy preparing him for the next four years under Trump. If agents came to the door, he was the one designated to answer. He would tell them his parents were not home. In a few days, she would sign over the house to him. She would put his name on the bank accounts. If she was deported, she planned to take her teenage daughter, who has autism. Her son would petition to bring his mother and sister back, a process she knew could take years, and might not happen at all. In the late afternoon, waiting for her husband to return from work, she thought about the town in Mexico where she’d spent her childhood and young-adult life. It was difficult to picture. Her parents had died. People she once knew were gone. What she knew was the life that she was beginning to think of in the past tense.\n\n“This has been my home,” she said.",

We’re excited to share with you a special series drawn from past seasons of the How To series. For the last six weeks, we’ve been revisiting episodes around the theme of winding down. This episode is our last in this series and one of my personal favorites. It’s from season four, How to Talk to People, and is called “How to Make Small Talk.” Take a listen as former host Julie Beck and producer Becca Rashid talk with experts, from hairstylists to self-described socially anxious people, about how they work on letting go of social anxiety.\n\n[Music]\n\nMimi Craft: Okay, so we’ll sit here; we’ll start like usual and talk about what you want to do with your hair … because you need a haircut. (Laughs.)\n\nJulie Beck: Does this moment feel awkward to you?\n\nTy Tashiro: It doesn’t. So I don’t know if it should.\n\nBeck: Great news, great news.\n\nErin Derosa: If I’m in a five-minute conversation, I’m like, What am I gonna say next? What’s the next thing that I should … Did I already talk about the weather? I get real panicked.\n\nBeck: I feel like I can chat with anybody for, like, five minutes. Right? And then if I run out of things to say in the middle, that’s my fear—because we are trapped here for the duration of this haircut. I can’t just do it, like, “Well, it was so great to see you—got to run!” while you’re holding my hair.\n\nCraft: We could stop talking, and I will try to put out a comfortable, chill vibe.\n\nTashiro: It’s, you know, pretty common. Someone might say something like: “Oh, there’s a really good vibe here.” And to me that is totally bewildering, how they discern that vibe within a few seconds.\n\n[Music]\n\nBeck: Hi. I’m Julie Beck, a senior editor at The Atlantic.\n\nRebecca Rashid: And I’m Rebecca Rashid, producer of the How To series.\n\nBeck: This is How to Talk to People.\n\nBeck: Here at The Atlantic, I oversee the Family section, and I’ve also been reporting on friendship for many years now. So I think a lot about relationships and community.\n\nAnd I do see often that people struggle to find and form the close relationships that they really want. And I think one of the barriers to that is the dreaded small talk.\n\nRashid: So I think in this first episode, we have to figure out: How does one even make small talk? And what explains that tendency so many of us have to look down at our phones and avoid conversation, or hide in the corner at a party and only talk to the people we know? So where better to do some research on this than to talk to the ultimate small-talk experts: at the hair salon.\n\n[Music]\n\nBeck: I feel like, okay, the main thing that I need to ask you is: When I’m sitting in this chair, do you even want to talk to me?\n\nCraft: Oh, yeah.\n\nBeck: You can be honest. It wouldn’t hurt my feelings if you didn’t want to.\n\nCraft: I have to be here all day, so I do need some entertainment.\n\nBeck: Okay.\n\nCraft: So, I like talking to people. I like getting the hot goss.\n\nBeck: Okay.\n\nCraft: Yeah. Classic hairdresser situation.\n\nBeck: I mean, it feels rude, but in my mind I’ve also wondered: Would you actually be relieved if I was just on my phone the whole time, and then you could have a break from being “on” all the time?\n\nCraft: That is totally fine with me. Like, if you want to be on your phone, I do think of it that way. Okay, great, I’ll have a break. I’ll just, like, think about my own things that are going on, organize my brain. I’m just glad that you’re here. Most hairdressers are very much prepared to talk all day, I think. I don’t know. No?\n\nRashid: Julie, I can’t stop thinking about how much fun we had with Erin Derosa and Mimi Craft at Sense Salon in Washington, D.C.\n\nBeck: Yeah, I mean, they are the women who actually do my hair. And it was very fun to get, like, a peek behind the scenes of what they’re thinking the whole time.\n\nDerosa: I feel like if you want to talk, that’s amazing. It is really entertaining and fun to have a conversation and to have good conversation. But if you don’t want to talk, don’t try to talk. [Julie laughs.] Because then it’s really hard to have a conversation, and then it’s even more work to, like, keep it going and try to, like, fill the silence or whatever. And I’m very comfortable with silence and very comfortable just doing my thing and, you know, someone else doing their thing. But if you do want to have a conversation, that’s also always welcome.\n\n[Hair-dryer sound]\n\nRashid: I’m curious; what is it about small talk that makes you so nervous?\n\nBeck: Okay—to clarify, I don’t know that it makes me nervous all the time. I think what’s interesting about it is, it’s like you can’t really get around it. Like, any relationship that you’re going to have has to start with a conversation.\n\nSo it’s more a situation where I am trapped on the train with an acquaintance I don’t know that well, and we have 20 minutes to fill, and I’ve got five minutes of material … If I’m getting my hair cut or anywhere where you’re just trapped with either an acquaintance or a stranger for a long time and you have to kind of navigate: How much are we going to talk to each other? What are we going to talk about? Would they rather I just left them alone, but we’re both too polite to say so?\n\nI do get in my head a lot about that, and I find it very hard to relax sometimes if I am receiving a service. And probably if I was just normal and relaxed and enjoyed the situation, it would make them more comfortable. Like, I’m probably putting off a vibe.\n\nRashid: It can be extra challenging when the terms of that relationship are not really established in any way; like, just having a conversation with that person doesn’t necessarily mean you’re moving toward friendship.\n\nBeck: Yeah, you’re right. Like, the kind of people that are in your life, but that relationship is not necessarily going to grow from what it already is, but you still need to interact with them and perhaps semi-regularly. And just, like, how do you approach that—like, the barista you see every day? And you know that she knows that you always get the iced vanilla latte and she knows that you know that she knows, but you still just order it freshly every time.\n\nRashid: Yes. Yes.\n\nBeck: And you don’t ever acknowledge anything.\n\nBeck: Do you both consider yourself extroverts?\n\nDerosa/Craft: No. Oh, no, no, no. Hard no. Extreme no.\n\nBeck: Well, then, how do you sit here and make small talk all day, every day? Does it exhaust you?\n\nCraft: I once heard that introverts like to have a one-on-one, deeper conversations, whereas extroverts are more comfortable with typical small talk. I am not interested in small talk. I want to get right into the real talk immediately. And I definitely don’t want to go to, like, a party, honestly, basically ever, or be in a crowd where I have to make small talk with a lot of people, because that is exhausting to me. But having deep connections and one-on-one, deeper conversations with people is—I like that, and I’m good at it.\n\nBeck: Well, how do you define small talk, then?\n\nCraft: For me, small talk is like: “Oh, it’s cold out.” “Yeah, it’s cold out.” “Oh, do you like cold?” “No?” “Oh, yeah; me too.” And that’s really boring. “Oh, how was your weekend?” “Good.” “Oh, cool.” I want to know what happened.\n\nBeck: Well, are you coming in hot with your clients? Like, “Do you believe in God?”\n\nCraft: I mean, sometimes I’m coming in hot. Sometimes if I’m like, “Oh, how was your weekend?” “Great.” I will be like, “Did anything crazy happen? Did anybody go to the hospital?” Like, I want to get straight into it. If somebody was at a party, you can tell when somebody comes in on a Saturday morning and they were at a party the night before. And you really are like, “What happened last night? What went down?” I do like getting straight into the details.\n\nDerosa: I guess I’ll also say, like, I don’t come in: “Hey, how’s your hair? Do you believe in God?” It’s more like, somehow it’ll come up somewhere in the conversation. You know, you’ll be talking about their family or like their parents or whatever. And then it’s like, “Oh, how were you raised? Were you raised religiously?” It sort of evolves. And then I will say: “Well, do you believe in God?” (Laughter.)\n\nBeck: So that’s a real example that has happened?\n\nDerosa: Oh, yeah; for sure. For sure. But I like to have conversations like that with people. And that’s one of my favorite things about this job, is having real conversations like that.\n\nCraft: She gets the very most out of people because she is so genuinely curious that even if somebody maybe was not going into a conversation thinking they were going to reveal a detail, she will get it out of them because of her genuine curiosity.\n\nDerosa: Yeah, ’cause a lot of people are sort of in denial about what is happening in their situation. And because we’ve heard so many stories that are similar, and we are like: “No, like, this is what’s really happening.”\n\nCraft: We’re like, “Girl, no, this is what’s happening.” And then, like, come to find out maybe their next visit or their visit after that, they’re like, “That is what’s happening.” Because that is the value in good small talk and conversation; it’s that you learn from other people’s experiences. Everything repeats itself. Like, nothing’s really a new thing. So somebody comes in, and you’re like: I know what’s happening there.\n\n—\n\nBeck: I think small talk gets a lot of hate, but even if it’s a little boring, it serves a purpose. So those basic, neutral topics that people love to hate on, like “How’s the weather?” Like “Sure is a hot one out there”—those serve a purpose of being something neutral that can smooth the path of our interactions.\n\nRashid: But I think sometimes my producer brain wants to cut to the story, and I’m not always as delicate in the way I phrase my questions. And my intent is not to be offensive, but maybe just to connect with the person in the way I know best, or maybe be respectfully personal and try to bridge that gap.\n\nBeck: So your approach to small talk is to try to get personal as quickly as possible.\n\nRashid: Not uncomfortably so. But I struggle with the repeated “How’s the weather?” with someone I see every day. It’s like, Let’s move this conversation along. We’ve seen each other. We have some basic context of who each other is.\n\nBeck: I feel like I thrive on that surface level. Just the sort of Seinfeldian, observational comedy of, like, these are things that are happening around us that I can remark upon and do a little bit with you and then, like, tip my hat and walk away. Once we transition to something that is a little more personal, that is where I feel like a little bumpy. In our conversation with Erin and Mimi, it really wasn’t that awkward, surface-level kind of small talk that I think people fear.\n\nRashid: Right, and it seems like they were really naturally cognizant of people’s different comfort levels and what would be an appropriate story to share, and they were sort of able to read the room and read the space of the conversation and, you know, they’re experts at this. They do this every day.\n\nBeck: Yeah, reading the room is a skill for sure, and I think for those of us who aren’t quite so practiced as they are, I want to understand more so what can cause a seemingly innocuous conversation to take a turn for the awkward, and how we navigate it when that happens and what the barriers are to getting out of our own heads and just chatting.\n\n[Music]\n\nRashid: Ty Tashiro is a social scientist who writes about awkwardness, and his book called Awkward: The Science of Why We’re Socially Awkward and Why That’s Awesome explores a lot of these social and behavioral trends specific to adults in the United States. And he helps people think through how to be in social spaces and be in social spaces and feel just a bit more confident.\n\n[Music]\n\nTy Tashiro: One of the great things about studying awkwardness is that everybody has had an awkward moment. For example, you’re giving a presentation, and you have an undone zipper. That’s super awkward, super embarrassing, but it’s actually not that big of a deal. It’s just an uncomfortable deviation from actually a small social expectation. If you had spinach in your teeth during a first date, same thing. It’s actually a really small kind of social expectation, but we have this really powerful emotional reaction to it.\n\nSome of my close friends had moved to new cities and I would go visit them, and we’d go out to parties or go to a bar or something. And some of these friends were awkward. And, you know, I’d watch them in these social interactions meeting new people, and it was just heartbreaking. Because they would be their regular awkward self. And you could see the other folks losing interest and saying “I gotta go get another drink” or something.\n\nJust that sad sort of excusing themselves for no good reason. And I thought to myself, like, Well, this is heartbreaking for my friend who’s trying to make new acquaintances or new friends in the city, but I thought, It’s also too bad for the other person because here’s this awkward person who has tremendous moral character, who’s super interesting, who’s been an amazing friend to me, but they ruled out any chance of future social interaction based on three or four minutes of chitchat. And so I had this thought, like, If the awkward person could skip the first five minutes of a social interaction, I actually think they’d be all right.\n\nBeck: What exactly was it that your friend was doing that made people want to leave and go get another drink? What was so awkward about it?\n\nTashiro: This friend was, is, still, a space invader. So, in the U. S., the typical amount of space you give someone is about 18 inches.\n\nBeck: Oh, I thought you meant like the video game. Okay.\n\nTashiro: Oh, no. Yeah, yeah. No, not that old-school. But he’s a space invader. So he’s probably about 10 inches, which is way too close. And that makes people feel uncomfortable. He also has trouble with voice modulation, which can certainly happen with awkward people. Speaks a little bit too loud, probably, for other people’s comfort. You know, I guess when you take a step back from it, my thought is, you know, Who cares? Like, if you can get past those little clumsy moments at the start, you find this really wonderful person.\n\nSo I wanted to see—are there ways that the awkward person can navigate those awkward moments a little bit more smoothly? On the other hand, for people who aren’t awkward, can they have a little more empathy for the awkward person’s situation?\n\nBeck: So in your book you write that some people are more prone to awkwardness than others. Where do you think you fall?\n\nTashiro: Oh, boy. I’m pretty awkward. When I was a kid, I was very awkward. And I think in adulthood, I can pass for socially fluent in most situations. But I certainly still have my moments.\n\nBeck: You’re doing great. I’m curious, can you just walk me through what goes through your mind when you, say, enter a party where you only know one or two people? What is the strategy that runs through your mind at that time?\n\nTashiro: So, you know, before the social event occurs, I do get some social anxiety. I think maybe the difference for someone who’s awkward is that these feelings of anxiety aren’t irrational. So I’ll give more thought to small details, like, What am I going to wear? What would be an appropriate thing to bring? What time am I gonna get there?\n\nAnd so I just have a little self-talk before I go into these situations. I call it my mental preparation, and I’ll just say, Hey, you don’t know anybody; you’re nervous about that. And that’s okay. You’ve been in these situations before, and you can do it. But I need to have a more assertive attitude than would be natural for me. When I get there, there’s kind of this funny thing that happens.\n\nSo let’s say we walk into the party, and it’s in full swing. It’s pretty common; someone might say something like, “Oh, there’s a really good vibe here.” And to me, that is totally bewildering how they discern that vibe within a few seconds.\n\nSo awkward people, when they enter a social situation, they’re not all at once kind of evaluating what’s going on. Instead, what they’re doing is looking at individual pieces of information and then kind of putting it together, almost like a puzzle, to figure out what the situation is like, and how they should behave.\n\nSo it takes longer for me to read the room, I guess, and then feel comfortable enough to get in there and interact smoothly with other people. And then when I get into it, I just try to be honest, actually. And so I would approach people—if you had the uncomfortable situation where you’ve talked to somebody and they’ve moved on to something else, and you’re standing there by yourself—I’ll just approach a group, and I’ll say, “Hey, I’m Ty. I’m new here. Do you mind if I join you?” And that might sound a little daunting to some folks, but I always find that people are really receptive to that. It took a little bit of boldness, maybe, to say something like that, and I think people appreciate that.\n\nBeck: So why do people feel awkward in that awkward moment where they’ve broken one minor expectation? Is it the same thing as social anxiety, or is it a unique feeling?\n\nTashiro: So, social anxiety is more of a forward-looking kind of emotion. So when we feel social anxiety, the core of that is we have some irrational fear that we’re going to mess up, or we’re going to make a fool of ourselves in a social situation.\n\nWith awkwardness, it’s more of this just in-the-moment, very present kind of feeling. And it even comes along with things like a racing heart, or your muscles might tense. Of course, one of the hallmarks is that you might blush, right? And people usually feel horrible about that. They think, I’ve just made this awkward moment worse by blushing.\n\nSo blushing actually sends a signal: Hey, I just did something awkward. I feel bad about that, and I’m blushing. I’m sending you this social signal. And people actually really appreciate that. And actually just being honest about the awkward moment that just took place can actually be beneficial for building some trust with another person.\n\nBeck: So do you think that you’ve gotten more comfortable with socializing over time, or do you just feel like you’ve learned strategies?\n\nTashiro: I think it’s that I’ve learned strategies first, and then the social comfort came after that. So let me give you a quick example, maybe from childhood, about some of these strategies I had to learn.\n\nSo when we would go to Wendy’s to get a hamburger, my parents would park the car. And they would turn around, and they’d say, “Ty, it’s time to mentally prepare.” And I would shake my head: Yes. I knew exactly what this meant.\n\nAnd what it was was this kind of Socratic dialogue where they would ask me a series of questions. And it would help me prepare for what the expectations would be in the social situation, and also help me think about what I needed to do with my social behaviors to handle it well and appropriately.\n\nSo they’d say things like, “Well, where are we?” And I’d say, “Well, we’re at Wendy’s!” And “What’s the first thing you need to look for when you step inside the door?”\n\nAnd I would say, “Well, I need to look and see if there’s a line.” And that’s because sometimes I would go in and just shoot straight to the front, and not because I was trying to cut or cheat.\n\nAnd this is hard for some non-awkward people to believe, but because I didn’t see the line, or it didn’t register with me. I was so narrowly focused on the hamburger and the fries that I would just not see all of the social information off to the side.\n\nSo once I was in line, you know, I need to figure out what to order; I need to look the cashier in the eye, say please, say thank you, not whip around on my tray and spill my drink all over the people behind me like I had done a couple times previously.\n\nSo this would happen not just once. This would happen dozens of times for various kinds of social situations. And my folks would need me to get into the habit of thinking about, Hey, what’s the goal in this situation? What are the small expectations you’re going to encounter? And then, what are the behaviors that you need to execute to be socially fluent in the situation?\n\nSo I think with, you know, most kids you could say, “Hey, make sure you’re polite when you’re ordering” or something like that, and they would think of all the little behaviors that go into that. But for the awkward kid, that’s not intuitive. And so you just need to break it down into component parts. I mean, if you walked with me into a Wendy’s now, I’m pretty smooth. (Julie laughs.)\n\n[Music]\n\nCraft: Like, I didn’t always know how to get into a conversation and connect with somebody. I just learned it when I started doing hair. And for people who don’t really know how to do it, I kind of was thinking, Is there a go-to question, or something? But it really depends on the setting.\n\nBeck: So do you actually want to or feel comfortable talking about yourself with clients? Or do you actively, like, keep the focus on them in their stories, because you maybe don’t want to share?\n\nCraft: I feel comfortable. I will share anything. Sometimes I feel like I don’t have anything that interesting to share, and so then I don’t want to talk about myself, because, like, “Oh, are you taking vacations?” “No.” “Okay, cool.” A lot of people, really—that is their No. 1 personal question: “Do you have any trips planned?”\n\nBeck: Oh, I’m very guilty of that. Because it’s like, it’s not too personal. But maybe it gives us something to talk about.\n\nDerosa: That is my conversation filler when I have pretty much nothing left. I say, “Do you have any trips planned?” Because we gotta, like, drum something up here.\n\nCraft: It could really go somewhere, where you’re talking about a trip and like fun things, but the potential for a dead end is high.\n\nBeck: That’s how you know you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel, I guess.\n\nCraft: Sort of like talking about the weather, you know?\n\nBeck: I’m going to be self-conscious about that question from now on.\n\nCraft: Sorry, I did not mean to make you feel that way.\n\nBeck: No, no, no, it’s good. But that does remind me of something I wanted to ask too, because I feel like a lot of what we’ve been talking about is, like, ways that the small talk manifests very uniquely to your job. And so, how much do you feel like the skills that y’all have here translate into the real world versus what is pretty specific to, like, this interaction and this relationship?\n\nCraft: I feel like it translates exactly the same, like, immediately.\n\nDerosa: I think you’re really good at that. I struggle with that. Because sometimes being in the hair salon, I’m really in my comfort zone in this weird way, and I’ll see the same person at the coffee shop or something and I sort of stumble on my words and I get sort of stumped. I get a little awkward and I think that’s more of my—I get some social anxiety going on if it’s people I don’t know. And this goes back to your introvert-versus-extrovert question. If it’s people I don’t know, I can do that small-talk thing to an extent, but then I can’t go all the way ’cause it’s a bigger setting. There’s more people. I’m really good in that sort of one-on-one moment.\n\nCraft: Like, even the hair salon, it really is, I think, a safe space in the community, because who am I going to tell? I’m not so invested that telling me is going to have, like any major impact in their personal life. So they can get things off their chest and feel safe; that it’s not, like, a risk.\n\nDerosa: And I do agree, if you’re not having those relationships in your community, you are missing out on just, like, It’s personal, but it’s casual.\n\nBeck: Yeah. I don’t know how we get to a place where we just accept that feeling awkward won’t kill us. But I’m not there yet.\n\n[Music]\n\nRashid: I’m curious if part of the stress, too, is that once you start a conversation with someone—and if you do start to feel awkward, and maybe you’re not comfortable being honest right away about the fact that you’re feeling awkward—and you want to dip out of the conversation, it can be hard to do that.\n\nBeck: For me, a situation that can cause some anxiety is if I am trapped with, say, like, an acquaintance on a train, and maybe that train ride is half an hour long, and what are we going to do? And I would love to tell you about a man that I once knew, an acquaintance of mine from college, who I truly would not remember at all were it not for this moment.\n\nHe was a friend of a friend. And one day we were both on the same train going down to Chicago together. I went to school outside of Chicago, and so this was like a good 40-, 45-minute train ride. And he pulled the most, like, amazing Uno-reverse ninja trick I’ve ever seen in conversation.\n\nAnd so we did the very classic, like: “Hey, how’s it going? How’s the one thing that I know about you?” “It’s still good. How’s the one thing that I know about you?” “It’s fine.” And then we ran out of material. And he just said: “It’s been so great talking to you. I’m going to go read my book now.” And then we both sat down on opposite sides of the train, and we read our books, and we took that half-hour train ride down to Chicago. And when I got off the train, we did like a friendly wave.\n\nAnd I actually don’t think we ever saw each other again. But I’ve thought about this man so regularly for the past, like, 10 years, because he just handled that interaction in such a smooth way that you almost never see.\n\nTashiro: I think we feel kind of more awkward than ever about these kinds of things: meeting new people, or the conversation in the elevator. It seems to stop people.\n\nBeck: Why do you say you think that we’re more fearful of awkwardness than we used to be?\n\nTashiro: I think maybe some of it has to do with the fact that we don’t have to interact with people as much as we used to. We can do it through our social media, or we can get absorbed in our phones or stay in the comfort of our home and stream some show.\n\nThere’s all these outs from, you know, actually being face-to-face with people and going through those uncomfortable moments of trying to get to know somebody for the first time or dealing with the prospect that they might reject us, that maybe they don’t want to hang out. And that’s a scary thing as well. So I think there’s these alternatives about how we can spend our time that are kind of semi-social or faux social, but I think that’s actually damaging, because it keeps us from doing the hard work of getting face-to-face and actually working to build a friendship.\n\nBeck: What do you mean by semi-social, faux social?\n\nTashiro: Well, you know, if you’re texting back and forth with somebody, that’s fine. But it’s obviously not as good, right, as sitting down with them for a long dinner and getting into just a deep conversation. And same thing with social media: We’ve kind of put our best foot forward on social media and we might have some nice interactions, but they’re not as gratifying as a face-to-face interaction with somebody.\n\nBeck: Is the texting and the faux social interactions to some degree maybe our way of preparing to go to Wendy’s?\n\nTashiro: Yeah, definitely. That’s a good point. In online dating, for example, you might send messages back and forth or whatever. And that kind of gives you a sense of the person; gets the interaction rolling a little bit before you actually meet up. When all you really want to do is get face-to-face and figure out if there might be some kind of chemistry here, but even in platonic situations, it’s the same thing. We can get stuck mentally preparing for something that should have happened a long time ago.\n\nBeck: Yeah, well one consequence of this fear of awkwardness is people go to parties, or they go to bars, and they only talk to people they already know. Have you noticed that in your life?\n\nTashiro: Oh, for sure. You know, it’s another thing, kind of, that makes me just want to go over and say things I have no business saying to other people.\n\nBeck: Like what?\n\nTashiro: I just want to say, like, “Go meet other people. You know, you’re standing here in your group of three you came in with, and you look semi-sad. Go talk to these other people you want to talk to.”\n\nBeck: So how can we break out of that? Do we really need to break out of that, or is it fine to just embrace the safety of hanging out with my existing friends at a party?\n\nTashiro: My bias would be: I don’t think that’s okay. You know, there’s all this disconnection going on. So the average person could benefit from more friends, and certainly benefit from more friends that they’ve built some quality intimacy with and they feel they can go to in a time of need.\n\nSo if we go with that perspective, then we should break out of our shell, and we should cross that junior-high dance floor of sorts and go talk to somebody new—knowing that this person might reject us, or knowing that the interaction might be a little bit awkward. But that’s okay.\n\n[Music]\n\nBeck: I mean, to some degree it’s a justified fear, right? Like, you probably will feel awkward. Like, you actually aren’t going to make it through this life without being awkward in social situations.\n\nBut I think, like, Ty made me realize that part of what makes things so awkward sometimes is trying to pretend that they’re not. Like, all of his advice would boil down to: Just be honest.\n\nLike, just go up to those people that you don’t know at the party and say, “I don’t know anyone at the party. Can I hang out with you?” And like, I would never in a million years have thought to say that to somebody. Like, I would probably try to be nonchalant by the punch bowl and, like, sidle my way into a conversation and hope it was just cool and nobody noticed that I didn’t really belong there. You know?\n\nSome of what is really challenging about small talk is: It’s so situational. Small talk with someone you admire on a train is different than small talk on a first date. And then there’s also each individual person’s reactions, and whether they want to be left alone, and how open they are to conversation. And how awkward you feel, and how awkward they feel.\n\nBut I think there can be a middle path where you read the room a bit. Maybe you have some questions in your back pocket, and you know, there’s certainly times where I leave my headphones in and I’m looking at my phone and I don’t really want to be spoken to either, but I think we have to bear in mind what we miss out on if we do that all the time.\n\nRashid: Yes. And I think that’s exactly what I wonder—if what gets lost is all of us getting used to not trying to start up a conversation with anyone. Out of fear, or out of fear that it won’t lead anywhere, or it doesn’t mean anything.\n\nBeck: Yeah. I remember Mimi and Erin talking a lot about how fueled they actually are by all the conversations that they have at work. And, like, not just purely for entertainment value, but also like feeling like these conversations are meaningful, and they are bringing something unique and special into their lives. They were just interested in people. And just, like, having a genuine curiosity for the person that’s in front of you fuels conversation.\n\nRashid: As meta as that is, we got to talk about it. (Laughs.)\n\nBeck: On that note, Becca, it’s been so great making a podcast with you. And I’m going to go read my book now.\n\n[Music]\n\nRashid: That’s all for this week’s episode of How to Talk to People. This episode was produced by me, Rebecca Rashid, and hosted by Julie Beck.

        "title": "J. D. Vance Stopped Talking About Eggs",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "We used to hear a lot about eggs from J. D. Vance. On the campaign trail, he talked about them constantly: how his kids were nuts for them, and how, thanks to the failed policies of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, omelets were ruined for everyone.\n\n“My kids eat a lotta eggs!” he said in Traverse City, Michigan. And in Monroeville, Pennsylvania: “A lotta eggs in my family!” Although other elements of the speech changed here and there, eggs—and their rising price—were always front and center. “The 7-year-old, he’s got his mama’s personality, very practical, worried about whether we have enough eggs,” Vance told a crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina. “And right now all across our country, we’ve got a lot of families that are cutting back because of Kamala Harris’s war on affordability in this country.”\n\nFor Republicans in 2024, eggs were a convenient shorthand for the squeeze of inflation, and nobody was more committed to this commiseration—or more devoted to the egg as a breakfast concept—than Donald Trump’s running mate. You had to respect Vance’s dedication to the project. Here was a man who seemed to have a genuine, Gaston-level passion for eggs. But now, as egg prices rise again—to historic highs—that shell has cracked.\n\nFor a man who so loved the egg, and so reviled any egg-related cost hurdle, Vance has been conspicuously silent as egg prices have continued to increase under President Trump. Last week, I reached out to Vance’s office to ask why he wasn’t talking about it. Had the Vance family found a new, more affordable source of complete protein? Had the kids developed a taste for Frosted Flakes? “The Trump Administration is working tirelessly to respond to the Avian flu outbreak that has decimated our egg supply,” Taylor Van Kirk,the vice president’s press secretary, told me in an emailed statement.\n\nRead: What Democrats don’t understand about J. D. Vance\n\nBut Vance certainly talks less about them. “Today for breakfast, I made my kids (aged 6, 4, and 2): 6 pieces of toast and 7 fried eggs,” the then-senator from Ohio posted on X in May. “I now understand the dads buying two 36 packs of eggs at Costco.” In September, the VP candidate filmed himself walking through the aisles of a Pennsylvania grocery store with his two young sons, pausing in front of the eggs to look aghast at the cost. Vance was, as people on the internet quickly pointed out, exactly wrong about the price of those particular eggs, but what drew more headlines was his children’s seemingly insatiable hunger for them. “Let’s talk about eggs. Because these guys actually eat about 14 eggs every single morning,” Vance said to the crowd of nearby shoppers, who seemed not nearly shocked enough at the idea that two little boys were regularly eating seven eggs apiece.\n\nAll the egg talk has died down since January. That month, Vance did predict in an interview with CBS’s Margaret Brennan that eventually “prices are going to come down” on gas and grocery items. And Van Kirk, his spokesperson, assured me that, “despite the damage caused by the last administration, President Trump is going to bring down prices and unleash American prosperity the likes of which the Fake News losers at the Atlantic have never seen.” But, as all egg lovers know, that hasn’t actually happened yet. Instead, the retail price of a dozen is now, on average, $4.95, more than 10 cents above the peak during the Biden administration, in January 2023. Because grocery stores typically use eggs as a loss leader, the wholesale price is much higher, and some restaurants have added an egg surcharge to their menu. These numbers could jump by as much as 41 percent over the next year, according to a new report from the Department of Agriculture.\n\nRead: It’s weird that eggs were ever cheap\n\nPerhaps Vance has gone silent on eggs because his boss, like Biden before him, can’t actually do a whole heck of a lot about inflation. Trump once promised that prices would go down on “day one,” but the new administration is encountering the same problem on eggs that the old one did: namely, a nasty bird-flu outbreak that has caused the destruction of more than 40 million egg-laying chickens in 2024.\n\nThe Trump administration says it’s trying. Last week, Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced a new $1 billion plan to address the bird flu, including enhanced biosecurity efforts and bird-vaccine development. Still, Rollins acknowledged that there is “no silver bullet” to solving the crisis. Confounding matters, of course, is that Trump’s friend and American meme-ster in chief, Elon Musk, has overseen the mass firing of thousands of federal workers, including several USDA employees who were working on the federal response to the bird-flu outbreak. Trump and Musk seem to have adopted the mantra that you have to break some eggs to make an omelet. But, of course, in a more basic sense, you’ve got to have eggs to begin with.\n\nNow it’s the Democrats’ turn to stand up for egg lovers. Each time the Trump administration embarks upon an objectionable move, such as a new slapdash effort to dismantle some government agency, Democrats return to a common refrain: “What’s this got to do with the price of eggs?” Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has been particularly outspoken. Voters “expected that [Trump] was going to be a change maker, not for chaos, not for corruption, but they wanted him to do something on their costs,” she told The New York Times last week. “But that’s not what he’s doing.”\n\nEggs have once again become a compelling symbol of political dysfunction. But Vance seems to have lost his appetite for them.",

        "title": "Trump Has a Funny Way of Protecting Women’s Sports",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "College programs are about to start paying athletes big money. Under new federal policy, women will see very little of it.\n\nDonald Trump has loudly portrayed himself as the protector of female athletes. So why is his administration preventing them from getting paid as much as their male counterparts?\n\nThe Department of Education announced recently that Title IX, the federal law that requires colleges to provide equal per-player funding for men’s and women’s sports, does not apply to name, image, and likeness payments paid directly to athletes from colleges and universities. That policy, which reverses a position adopted by the Biden administration, will cut collegiate women athletes off from a huge new source of funding set to come into play this year: Next month, a federal judge is expected to approve a $2.8 billion class-action settlement that, after years of litigation, will finally allow athletes to be receive name, image, and likeness payments from their school rather than through outside NIL collectives, the college-sports version of a super PAC.\n\nThe schools that choose to opt in to the settlement are expected to have a salary cap of up to $20.5 million each to distribute to players. Under the guidance released during the final days of the Biden administration, they would have had to distribute that money between male and female athletes in proportion to their participation rates. Now, under Trump, that money is all but guaranteed to flow overwhelmingly to male athletes, mostly football and basketball players. For example, the University of Georgia plans to give 75 percent of its revenue-sharing to the football team, 15 percent to men’s basketball, 5 percent to women’s basketball, and the remaining 5 percent to all other sports. Other big-time sports schools are expected to follow a similar formula.\n\nMarc Novicoff: The logical end point of college sports\n\n“Without a credible legal justification, the Biden Administration claimed that NIL agreements between schools and student athletes are akin to financial aid and must, therefore, be proportionately distributed between male and female athletes under Title IX,” Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education, said in a statement. “The claim that Title IX forces schools and colleges to distribute student-athlete revenues proportionately based on gender equity considerations is sweeping and would require clear legal authority to support it.”\n\nIndeed, to Trump, “protecting women’s sports” begins and ends with one idea: barring transgender women from competing. During his presidential campaign, Trump courted NFL- and college-football fans with a blitz of ads attacking Kamala Harris for her positions on trans rights. Shortly after taking office, he followed through on his campaign promises by signing an executive order banning trans women and girls from competing in sports. The White House touted the order as “ensuring equal opportunities for women in sports.”\n\nIn reality, the order looks like a classic Trump blend of maximum culture-war posturing for minimum tangible benefit. NCAA President Charlie Baker testified before Congress in December that out of the 510,000 athletes competing in college sports, fewer than 10 were trans. (Baker did not indicate whether they were men or women.) Even at the youth-sports level, experts estimate that the number of trans athletes is fewer than 100 nationwide.\n\nBy comparison, the Trump administration’s recent NIL guidance could affect thousands of college women, deepening an already glaring disparity. With some exceptions—such as the Louisiana State University gymnast Olivia Dunne, a social-media sensation who makes an estimated $4 million a year—female college athletes have had a difficult time keeping pace with their male counterparts in the new era of NIL money. NIL collectives are typically financed by wealthy boosters and donors who care primarily about men’s basketball and football. Even though the economic value of women’s sports has grown dramatically in recent years, women still don’t get the same attention or brand opportunities as men. Women’s sports still receive only about 15 percent of total sports-media coverage.\n\nWomen are concerned that they won’t have much of a voice as revenues in their sports grow. In January, a group of more than 100 female Division I athletes sent letters to the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference commissioners requesting a meeting and expressing their concerns about a variety of issues, most notably the disparity in NIL money between male and female athletes. So far, the commissioners have not agreed to a meeting.\n\nJemele Hill: The one downside of gender equality in sports\n\n“My first impression is that Title IX is being used to an extent to feed the culture and political ideological differences in our country,” Ajhanai Keaton, an assistant sports-management professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst’s Isenberg School of Management, told me. “If it is an educational enterprise, there shouldn’t be any question that money should be split evenly between the genders in sports.”\n\nSome would argue that women being unable to keep pace with men in NIL money is just the free market at work, given the indisputable popularity of football and men’s basketball. On its face, a school like Georgia giving the majority of its revenue-sharing to the football team makes sense, because football accounted for about three-quarters of the Bulldogs’ $203 million in revenue last year, the fifth-most among major college football programs. But the tendency of the free market to reinforce existing inequalities is exactly why laws like Title IX exist.\n\nEven before the rise of NIL money, college sports were failing to live up to the law’s mandate. According to a report released by the Government Accountability Office last year, women account for 56 percent of undergraduates but only 42 percent of student athletes. And in 2022, a USA Today report on Division I sports concluded that for every $1 schools spent on travel, equipment, and recruiting for men’s teams, they spent just 71 cents on women’s teams.\n\nIn the pandemic season of 2021, men’s and women’s basketball players played their March Madness tournament in separate, isolated “bubbles.” The men’s players were given an enormous, well-stocked gym befitting top athletes, while the women were given only a few yoga mats and a tiny rack for dumbbells. After the obvious disparities were blasted on social media, the NCAA commissioned an outside firm to conduct a gender-equity review. The unfairness turned out to extend to the meal plan. “The portions originally were very small,” an unnamed women’s coach said in the report. “I didn’t ask the men’s team about the food. I saw a buffet on Twitter … I would love to be in a buffet situation.”\n\nAlex Kirshner: Caitlin Clark is just the beginning\n\nThe NCAA apologized for the weight-room disparity, but the clear takeaway was that even though the broadcast rights for women’s basketball bring in an estimated $65 million a year, the organization still willingly chose to provide substandard resources for female athletes.\n\nWhen Trump signed his executive order on transgender athletes, he made sure to pack the East Room of the White House with young girls. It made for a good photo op. But the administration’s actual policy agenda will mean fewer opportunities for those girls, not more. If all of this is Trump’s idea of protecting women, then it’s fair to say that female athletes are officially on their own.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Hours after his election victory last Sunday, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), said on national television that he would try to “achieve independence from the U.S.A. I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program,” Merz continued, but “it is clear that the Americans … are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.”\n\nAmerican security guarantees have protected the Federal Republic of Germany since 1945. Never since then has a chancellor of that country suggested that it emancipate itself from Washington. Not even France’s Emmanuel Macron, who has called for building a “sovereign Europe” capable of defending itself since he was first elected in 2017, could have put the imperative in starker terms. So who is the incoming German chancellor making this transformative demand?\n\nMerz is a conservative by any measure—social, fiscal, political—and far from being the avatar of a freethinking new generation in Germany, he may wind up being the last chancellor to hail from the old one. But history has plans for him. He will likely step into the highest office of Europe’s biggest economy and most powerful state just as the United States, under Donald Trump, abandons its post–World War II role on the continent. Merz, with his right-wing instincts and establishment roots, will be guiding his country, maybe even the continent, through a period of epochal change.\n\nAlready, Merz has pledged to increase defense spending and put Paris, Warsaw, and London at the lead of a new policy to shore up Ukraine’s sovereignty and defend Europe from Russia with or without the United States. He has even sought to explore whether France and Britain might extend their nuclear umbrella to the rest of Europe, in place of American protection. At any other time, this agenda of European self-reliance might be a radical one. Now it’s a logical response to events.\n\nWhen he takes office, most likely at the end of April and at the helm of a coalition government with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Merz will not be riding a wave of enthusiasm. The CDU won just 28.6 percent of the vote in this election—almost eight points more than the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), and the second-worst showing of the party’s history. And Merz has a personal reputation for being cocky, ambitious, and overly cerebral. He’s a politician with hard edges, and many Germans, especially women, find him hard to like.\n\nRead: Germany’s anti-extremist firewall is collapsing\n\nAt 6 foot 5, the incoming chancellor literally looks down on most people he talks with. He is also a self-made multimillionaire who describes himself as “upper middle class” yet flies his own private propeller plane. He is a former artilleryman in the Bundeswehr who likes authority and orderliness, and he has a taste for cashmere V-neck sweaters and checkered shirts. Once, when a TV crew was following him for a day, he admonished an employee to brush their hair.\n\nThe postwar generation to which Merz belongs has governed Germany for decades. Its men and women were raised amid the country’s immediate moral reckoning with the horrors of the Nazi Reich, and they have made this imperative central to their vision. Merz’s grandfather was a Nazi brownshirt and the mayor of Brilon, a picturesque town in the country’s west where Merz also grew up. Two generations later, Merz has watched the rise of the far-right AfD with profound concern, calling it a “disgrace for Germany.”\n\nMerz’s life in Brilon was economically comfortable but not always easy or orderly. As a child, he spent six months in a tuberculosis clinic run by nuns—an experience he has dryly described as “not nice at all.” His sister was killed in a car crash at age 21. And he was an impatient and irascible teenager who had to leave his local high school for disciplinary reasons, and whose grades were so bad that he had to repeat a year.\n\nMerz’s political career has been similarly jagged; he has probably survived more defeats than any other living German politician. A former judge, he rose to prominence as a member of Parliament in the 1990s as the standard-bearer for the conservative camp within the CDU. Yet in 2000, Merz lost a bid for party leadership to an unassuming East German named Angela Merkel. Once she became chancellor, Merkel made a point of marginalizing her most threatening rival.\n\nMerz left politics in 2009 to make money—lots of it. He joined a law firm in Düsseldorf and sat on the boards of many big corporations, including prestigious investment firms such as BlackRock Germany, of which he was chair, as well as run-of-the-mill companies such as the toilet-paper producer WEPA. Nine years would pass before he returned to politics. By then, in 2018, Merkel was engulfed in criticism for having let nearly a million refugees into Germany from the Syrian civil war. Within minutes of her announcement that she would step down from the CDU leadership, Merz had a statement ready announcing his candidacy. But the CDU didn’t choose him—at least, not at first. Twice, it picked centrists in the mold of Merkel. But the party kept losing electoral ground. Finally, in 2022, its members saw fit to give Merz a chance to revive the CDU by shifting it to the right.\n\nRead: MAGA has found a new model\n\nMerz favored a politics of law and order and a relatively hard line on immigration. He has at one point even advocated declaring a state of emergency in order to push migrants back from Germany’s borders, something European Union law would otherwise prohibit. Only weeks ago, he passed a parliamentary motion calling for placing undocumented migrants awaiting deportation in closed facilities. This proposal got through only because it won the votes of the AfD. Merz had earlier promised never to work with the far-right party. Now he told critics that if the AfD wanted to vote for his proposal, he could hardly prevent it.\n\nSome of Merz’s rhetoric around immigration sounds a lot like that of the populist right. He once called Ukrainian war refugees “social-welfare tourists”—though he later apologized for it. He has also designated the sons of migrants who fail to respect female schoolteachers “little pashas.” If all this was meant to reduce the AfD’s appeal by moving the CDU to the right, however, it was a failure. His tough talk did not prevent the AfD from capturing almost 21 percent of the vote this year—double what it got in 2021.\n\nMerz’s economic views may be the ones most starkly challenged by the geopolitical moment he finds himself in. To wrest European security from the North American framework will require new investments, new programs, and, almost inevitably, big spending. Merz brings to this task the instincts of a free marketeer impatient with government outlay and bureaucracy. In the 2000s, he promised that if he became finance minister, he’d make the income-tax form, which in Germany runs to dozens of pages, fit on a beer tap. In 2008, the year of the global financial crisis, Merz published a book arguing that Germany should cut back its welfare state, deregulate its economy, and encourage people to buy more stocks instead of letting their savings languish in bank accounts. Germany’s economy has stagnated for the past five years, and most of Merz’s solutions to that seem to come at the expense of workers or the environment: reducing unemployment benefits, creating incentives for Germans to work longer hours, and rolling back climate regulation. With the auto industry in crisis, he advocates removing the EU ban on internal-combustion-engine cars that is supposed to begin in 2035.\n\nBut conservative economic orthodoxies may soon run up against other priorities, some of them every bit as close to Merz’s core. Like most German politicians of the immediate postwar generation, Merz is a Europeanist. He sees the EU not as a constraint but as a conviction. He is an ardent supporter of Ukraine, having criticized his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, for backing Kyiv too timidly and walking in lockstep with President Joe Biden instead of choosing a more assertive course with Paris and London. Scholz once marketed himself as a “peace chancellor,” to which Merz quipped: “Peace you can find in any cemetery. It is our freedom that we must defend.”\n\nRead: Is it time to bury Merkel’s legacy?\n\nMerz wants Europe to become sovereign and free of foreign interference because he believes that the new administration in Washington, like Moscow, seeks to divide and undermine democracy in Europe. The White House, like the Kremlin, seems intent on intervening in elections on behalf of the far right, and on forcing Brussels to walk back regulations on Big Tech that might curtail disinformation and hate speech. Countering this agenda, when it was only a Russian one, was well in line with conservative German values. On Sunday, the chancellor-in-waiting said: “I have absolutely no illusions about what is happening from America. Just look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk … the interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow.”\n\nMerz’s conservatism may be what allows him to shepherd Europe through a historic transformation. Just as the anti-communist hard-liner Richard Nixon was uniquely situated to establish American relations with the People’s Republic of China in 1972, and just as the left-wing Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was best placed to cut back Germany’s welfare state in the 2000s, Merz, with his stodgy, center-right credentials and postwar pedigree, may be just the leader to get Germans and Europeans to spend big for their emancipation from the United States.",

        "content": "If you’re like me, you know that getting rid of your car is one of the best things you can do for the climate, and also that you will never do it. This is a car-oriented country, and a car-oriented time. But in 2019, the private cars and light trucks that ordinary people drive for work and shopping and leisure were responsible for about 15 percent of U.S. fossil-fuel-energy use. Electric vehicles get a lot of press, but less than 1 percent of energy used for transportation came from electricity. Personal transportation is a large contributor to carbon emissions in America; it’s also the hardest to give up.\n\nBut trading a gasoline automobile for an electric one (or for a bus or train) isn’t the only way ordinary citizens can contribute to fossil-fuel reduction. Decarbonization has two pillars: First, generate electricity from energy that does not emit carbon—renewable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal instead of fossil fuels. That requires legislative and regulatory change. Second, use electricity to run as much of your personal life as possible.\n\nThat’s where ordinary people like you and me can contribute. At least 7 percent of U.S. fossil-fuel energy is used for something fairly banal: residential space and water heating. Put differently, making relatively smaller, cheaper, and easy changes to home heating in America could reduce fossil-fuel use nearly as much as taking half of all private vehicles off the roads. If you want to do the most immediate good for the planet, replace your aging gas furnace with a new, electric appliance.\n\nYou can heat a building in many ways. A boiler heats water and cycles it through radiators that heat rooms. A furnace transfers heat to air, which it then pushes through vents into living spaces.\n\nMost American homes run these devices by burning fossil fuels. Depending on your geographic location and the age of your home and its systems, those fuels might include distillate fuel oil (mostly still used in the Northeast), propane (common in rural areas), or natural gas (common everywhere else). Every one of these releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when burned.\n\nBut boilers and furnaces aren’t your only options. Instead of heating the air, heat pumps move heat from one place to another by converting a substance called refrigerant between its liquid and gas forms. Your refrigerator is a heat pump. So is an air conditioner. Both of those devices pump heat in reverse: Warm air is absorbed by the refrigerant coils and pumped out. Your fridge and AC unit move heat in only one direction. But a heat pump can do both, meaning that the same appliance can heat in the winter—even in very cold climates—and cool in the summer. (“Heat pump” is a terrible, confusing name for these gadgets.)\n\nHeat pumps have been around for decades, but they didn’t used to be very efficient, especially in extremely cold weather. That’s changing. Now some cold-climate heat pumps can transfer heat effectively in subzero temperatures. An oil- or gas-fueled furnace (or other backup heat sources) might be required on the coldest days, but on all the others, your heat can be electric.\n\nIn Maine, the lack of natural-gas infrastructure made it easy for the state to encourage electrification of home heating. Central air is uncommon in the state, and installing a heat pump adds cool air-conditioning for free. Maine’s electricity grid is already very clean, and these new heat-pump devices are much more efficient than window AC units.\n\nMichael Stoddard, the executive director of the Efficiency Maine Trust, the state’s energy-efficiency organization, told me that more than 60,000 heat pumps have been sold to Mainers in the past seven years. Some Mainers have been burned by the high cost of heating oil, a commodity whose price fluctuates. State-sponsored consumer-rebate programs, including one that offers up to $1,500 back on purchases of heat pumps, has also driven recent adoption of the devices. Stoddard worried that participation in the state’s incentive programs might dry up because people wouldn’t want to spend the money during the pandemic. “Instead, participation has doubled,” he said. People were stuck at home, some with extra money to spare, given their stimulus benefits and reduced spending. And parts of Maine can still reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.\n\nDoes carbon reduction itself motivate Mainers to adopt heat pumps? “I’m confident the answer is that it is evolving,” Stoddard hedged. But even if residents aren’t making green-energy choices with decarbonization in mind, the success of incentive programs such as the Efficiency Maine Trust’s have helped the state advance more aggressive policy proposals. In the weeks prior to our conversation, Stoddard told me, Maine had just completed a new climate action plan, and decarbonizing heating systems was among its top three mitigation recommendations. “Now you have everybody talking about this as if it’s just a thing we have to get going on,” he said.\n\nElsewhere, switching to a heat pump is a tougher sell. Natural gas pollutes less than distillate, and it doesn’t suffer the commodity-price fluctuations that have helped shift homeowners off heating oil in the Northeast. And more than 60 percent of the U.S. residential market already has air-conditioning, according to Paul Camuti, the chief technology and strategy officer at Trane Technologies, which manufactures HVAC systems. That means the benefit of added air-conditioning from a heat-pump switchover doesn’t apply to many American homeowners.\n\nEven so, electric utilities have strong incentives to move homeowners to electric heat: They can sell them more electricity, for one thing. And they can realize their own decarbonization goals more rapidly. For both of these reasons, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) in central California has adopted some of the country’s most aggressive rebate incentives for heat pumps, as much as $3,000 on heat-pump space heaters and $2,500 on heat-pump water heaters. According to Scott Blunk, SMUD’s strategic business planner of electrification and energy efficiency, the incentives can make the payback almost immediate.\n\nThe water-heating program has been the most popular, probably because the incentive provides the most benefit at the lowest cost to homeowners and contractors. Electrifying water and space heating is still unfamiliar to many people, and Blunk speculated that giving them a reason to try the technology might warm them up, as it were, to other gas-to-electric conversions. Heat-pump space heating is entirely viable in central California, where the temperature doesn’t drop below freezing that often. Even without the incentives, replacing an air-conditioning unit and a furnace with one heat pump can save a lot of money in the long run, since the heat pump can do the job of both.\n\nAs was the case in Maine, Sacramento is leveraging the success of its electrification programs to shift corporate strategy and state policy. The energy code for 2023 is currently being developed in California, and it is making the rollout of electric devices easier. Adjusting the baselines of reasonable energy need can make room for electrifying more home devices. And making electric-appliance installations easier for builders encourages them to recommend cleaner appliances. In addition to reducing carbon emissions directly, every heat-pump installation has an incremental effect on the viability of policy changes.\n\nYou don’t have to get rid of your old appliances right away, either. “To hit our decarbonization goals, we don’t need to take out someone’s perfectly good water heater,” Blunk told me. “We just need to replace it with an electric one when it goes out.” That’s an easier pill to swallow for homeowners, who can think of the incremental cost of electric conversions as a small premium over the money they were going to spend on a replacement device anyway. Rebates and incentives sweeten the deal.\n\nSacramento power burns no coal, and runs roughly 50 percent carbon-free, thanks in large part to hydroelectric power. Blunk calculates that a new-construction home on the grid might reduce its carbon output from 2.5 to 1.1 tons of carbon a year, and a 1978 home’s could drop from 5.2 to 2.5 tons. Because 80 percent of the region uses natural gas for space and water heating, electrification could substantially reduce fossil-fuel use there.\n\nUnfortunately, many Americans still don’t trust electric and renewable sources for heating. Some blamed Texas’s widespread outages during a severe storm this month on the failure of wind turbines, but that’s not right: The state still relies largely on natural-gas energy for electricity. And even gas-burning furnaces require electricity to work, making those appliances no less unreliable if the power goes out for an extended time, as it did across much of the state. Amid climate change, gas isn’t an answer so much as just another problem. “Electrifying buildings and vehicles while switching to climate-safe clean electricity while adapting our infrastructure to a changing climate will be deeply challenging,” David Pomerantz, the executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute, told me. “But relying on gas in a changing climate would also be deeply challenging.” Electric power is fundamental to everything we do, making widespread reform of the grid and the tools that use it even more urgent.\n\nInstead, we expend energy glorifying electric cars. For this year’s Super Bowl, General Motors spent millions on a star-studded ad celebrating its ambitious electric-vehicle plans. It was surprising, but not out of place. Less surprisingly, no heat-pump ads aired during the big game. Even if trust in the grid can be improved, electric heat faces one big problem: Transitioning off natural gas just isn’t as sexy as solar panels or electric cars. Unless you’re a contractor or an HVAC nerd, you probably don’t think much about your heating and cooling systems. They are hidden in attics and basements and utility closets, tucked away on roofs or in side yards. These machines go almost entirely unconsidered unless they break down. Nobody shows off their new water heater when friends come over the way they might show off a Tesla in the garage.\n\nUnlike solar panels, clean upgrades to home appliances also don’t produce social-signaling benefits—the neighbors can’t gawk at your greener home, and you can’t take pride in passersby noticing it. How do you make a heat pump sexy? “I don’t know,” Blunk admitted. “I think the closest we have is cooking.” He means the blue flame of a stove, the only place in the home where a resident can see and hear and feel natural gas at work. Stove-top cooking is so essential to justifying home gas service, the fossil-fuel industry has poured resources into preserving the appliances’ appeal.\n\nEven SMUD’s executives felt protective of kitchen gas. “You’re never going to get rid of my gas stove,” Blunk recalled them saying. So he bought them portable induction-cooking units (a kind of electric stove that transfers heat directly to cookware) to demonstrate that modern electric cooking heat wasn’t like the old wire coils they might remember from the 1950s.\n\nNatural-gas cooking is responsible for only 2 percent of residential natural-gas use—far less than space and water heating. Still, converting from a gas cooktop to an electric-induction one can have a substantial, if different, impact. For one part, there are health benefits: Igniting open-gas fires in your home produces pollution that can exacerbate asthma. But from a sustainability perspective, the kitchen is the place where people develop an emotional relationship to natural gas. The blue flame lapping over the sturdy cast-iron grates imparts a sense of power and control to cooking, just as the rumble of a carburetor engine in a muscle car does to driving.\n\nThat makes the induction cooktop the Tesla of the natural-gas-decarbonization movement. It’s the device you can brag about while also showing your friends and family that electricity is just as good as gas for cooking, if not better. “When I first got my induction,” Blunk told me, “I had a party and invited all my friends over.”\n\nBrian Keane has built a whole organization around that idea. SmartPower, a nonprofit renewable-energy outreach and marketing company, helps municipalities and utilities get their citizens and customers interested in clean energy. “Americans listen to what friends and co-workers are doing. That’s the pressure point,” Keane told me. And when it comes to energy, once you’ve taken action, whether that be installing a smart thermostat or replacing a combustion furnace, the best thing to do is tell a friend or colleague that you’ve done it. This is particularly important for renewable energy in the home, Keane said, because no brand name is associated with it. Nobody knows what furnace or water heater they have. “There’s no Coca Cola, no Pepsi.”\n\nSmartPower has run a series of marketing campaigns for solar adoption around the country, many of which amount to better-funded and more-formal versions of Blunk’s induction-stove house party. Sometimes they hold block parties when the panels go up on the first roof in a neighborhood, or host house parties with a utility-bill reveal (really!). People used to want to wait for a technology to be widespread, but Keane thinks that lifestyle-technology turnover has entered the home. “Apple is always coming out with a new iPhone,” he tells homeowners; a water heater is no different. “You could keep waiting, or just buy this one. It’ll work for 20 years.” Averaging across campaigns, SmartPower’s solar programs were found to increase the rate of solar adoptions in a municipality by nearly 1,000 percent.\n\nCamuti, the Trane HVAC-equipment executive, agrees that the change in perception about heating and cooling in the past decade has been dramatic. “I relate this directly to the availability of online information,” he told me. People still ask dealers, tradespeople, or contractors what they should buy, which makes upstream incentives from states and utilities to those agents extremely important. “But people go online and ask if there is a better choice,” Camuti said. “We are starting to have a relationship with them.”\n\nThere are some lessons for homeowners. First, there is benefit in advocating for home upgrades on your block, at your workplace, and in your family. Some people are interested in clean energy for its own sake, but many more are motivated by doing something beneficial for their communities. And emissions reductions positively impact a local environment before the global one. Second, lower-impact but more-visible upgrades, such as induction cooktops or solar water heaters, might become the gateway to abandoning natural gas. Nobody thought they wanted or needed an internet-connected thermostat before Nest came on the scene, after all. But it was stylish and functional, and many smart-home rollouts began from that unlikely start.\n\nIf you’re building a new home, it’s easier to skip natural gas entirely. Not running a gas line will save thousands of dollars, and it will prevent you from ever installing gas-burning appliances. But for existing homes, you should abandon the idea that a solar roof or an electric car is the only path forward. Replace your gas cooktop and show it off to friends, or on Instagram. Blog or podcast or post on Facebook about it, so that human experiences will come up in search results when people go hunting for their own products. If your gas furnace or air conditioner or water heater is near the end of its lifespan, replace it with a heat pump. And if not, plan to do so when it conks out. If you live in a large population center, do these things sooner, because your action will send faster signals to utilities and governments that the tide is turning. If you want to do your part to reduce carbon emissions, do what you can to wean yourself off the gas you use in your home, not just the kind you put in your car.",

        "content": "Andrew Tate is not a subtle man. Although he denies all of the criminal allegations against him—which include human trafficking, rape, and money laundering—he constantly and loudly proclaims his misogyny and fascination with violence. Whatever else you might say about the kickboxer turned right-wing-manosphere influencer, he is not a hypocrite. In public, he has said that women “bear responsibility” for sexual assault. In private, he reportedly told one woman whom he’d been dating, “I love raping you.”\n\nThis is the guy who landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this week, after his plight was taken up by influencers and fixers from the movement to “Make America great again.” Until this week, Andrew and his brother, Tristan, had been banned from leaving Romania, where both are under investigation. President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he knew nothing about the brothers’ release, even though his special envoy, Richard Grenell, had previously discussed their case with Romanian officials. The Tates’ presence in Florida looks like a reward to the manosphere, which helped draw male voters to Trump. It’s also a signal that MAGA world looks after its own.\n\nTo most adults, Andrew, the alpha Tate brother, cuts a ludicrous figure, with his cigars, frequently bared chest, and penchant for sockless loafers. But he is a hero to millions of teenage boys and young men, who both consume and spread his content, despite his seeing them as stupid marks to be exploited. At his peak, Tate supported his flashy lifestyle by encouraging his young male fan base to join his “War Room” and sign up for worthless courses at his “Hustlers University.” (He once offered a “PhD”—a “pimping hoes degree.”)\n\nRead: Why MAGA likes Andrew Tate\n\nThe Tate brothers, who are dual U.S.-British citizens, were awaiting trial in Romania over sex-abuse and trafficking allegations by more than 40 women, many of whom worked as performers for their webcam business. (Tristan, like his brother, denies all wrongdoing.) According to the Romanian authorities, they used the “loverboy” method to recruit these women, “misrepresenting their intention to enter into a marriage/cohabitation relationship and the existence of genuine feelings of love.” By Andrew’s own admission, the women were then confined to his compound outside Bucharest and set to work in a “scam” operation soliciting money from men online. The youngest of the alleged victims groomed into working for the webcam operation was 15. According to prosecution documents leaked to the BBC, an audio recording captures Tristan Tate saying he will “slave these bitches,” while one complainant says that Andrew told her, “Shut up you whore, you will do as I say.” The Tates are supposed to return to Romania as the case against them progresses, but without American help the authorities there cannot force the brothers to do so. An outstanding European arrest warrant against them, issued to British police after four women made a civil claim against the brothers in the U.K., is also now worthless without U.S. cooperation.\n\n“Getting an alleged human trafficker and rapist to the U.S. is really batshit,” Matt Shea, a co-author of the book Clown World: Four Years Inside Andrew Tate’s Manosphere, told me. “What does the MAGA movement like about the Tates? They helped them get elected, radicalizing young men by preaching extreme misogyny, and a form of conservatism, and distrust of the courts, journalism, and mainstream institutions.”\n\nAlthough Grenell denies officially lobbying the Romanian government on behalf of the brothers, and the Romanians have said there was no “pressure” applied to them, influential figures in MAGA world have long championed the Tate brothers. In 2022, Elon Musk reinstated Andrew’s Twitter account, five years after he was removed from the platform for misogyny. (He remains banned by YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.) In 2023, Tucker Carlson conducted a sympathetic interview with Andrew, presenting him as an antidote to the “mass conversion therapy” of boys into passive, feminized sheep. “Tate’s view is that men want respect above all; it’s how they’re wired,” said Carlson. “In order to get respect, men must become worthy of it. They must become more impressive—wake up early, work as hard as you can, stay sober, find God.”\n\nThis is a gross mischaracterization of Tate’s rhetoric, of course—painting him as a faintly edgy role model with a strong work ethic, when he is in fact a bullying sexist. Still, at least the God bit is true: Tate announced that he had converted to Islam in 2022.\n\nIf the sex-trafficking allegations weren’t so bleak, there would be something irresistibly comic about people like Carlson trying to defend Andrew Tate and his brother as pious avatars of downtrodden modern manhood, only for the Tates to keep popping up and reiterating that they really do love pimping those hoes.\n\nThe Tates’ outlook is as eclectic as it is extreme. On the day of the October 7 attacks in Israel, Andrew announced that “Israel forced 5 vaccines in everyone’s arm. Forced. Rather live in Palestine and own my blood. Allah Akbar.” The Trump administration’s apparent decision to help someone like him sends a powerful signal across MAGA world: All that matters is loyalty. Blameless Haitian immigrants in Ohio are cat-eating monsters, but Andrew Tate, an alleged human trafficker, is one of us. Muslims in northern England are child-raping savages, but we should defend this Muslim because he mocks feminists on the internet. We’ll pose tastelessly with the case files on Jeffrey Epstein, as if they’re prizes on a game show, but this guy—you get the idea. “Are they guilty?” matters less than “Are they on our side?” This is the logic of a crime family, not a political movement.\n\nThe Tates have always framed any allegations against them as persecution. “They want me to serve time for tweets,” Andrew posted on February 17. “None of the charges against me were ever real.” Their true crime, in their telling, is not human trafficking or sexual abuse, but anti-wokeness. Just last month, Trump’s personal lawyer—and now White House adviser—Alina Habba appeared on a podcast with Andrew, where she likened his legal troubles to those of her boss. “I sympathize with you because I think you go through a lot of the same ‘Show me the person, I’ll find the crime’ that President Trump has gone through,” Habba told Tate.\n\n“Tate is a very strong ally in the creation of this myth of persecution against anyone who isn’t ‘woke,’ which is very convenient for MAGA, who are trying to characterize any legal move against them as lawfare or judicial activism,” Shea told me. “That’s crazy because at the heart of this are dozens of alleged victims of the worst crimes imaginable. The Trump administration has said nothing about those women or the case itself.” The Tate brothers, ever alert for a viral trend, have recently taken to saying that the investigation against them is funded by USAID.\n\nNot everyone on the right is buying their act. “The way conservatives and conservative organizations respond to Andrew Tate arriving on US soil will tell you everything you need to know about them,” The Daily Wire’s Jeremy Boreing wrote on X when the news broke of the brothers’ departure from Romania. “Any organization or host who embraces him is engaged in far worse than simple grift, though it is that.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis—who has a frosty relationship with the Trump White House—said he had not been informed in advance that the two human-trafficking suspects would end up in his state. “Florida is not a place where you’re welcome with that type of conduct,” he added.\n\nRead: The adolescent style in American politics\n\nNow, that isn’t quite true: The Sunshine State is currently home to Russell Brand, another British right-wing influencer who is also under investigation for alleged sex offenses in his home country. (He has denied the accusations.) Andrew Tate has already been invited to speak by the Tampa Bay Young Republicans. “We’re old enough to remember when a ‘Convicted Felon’ won the Presidency,” the group’s X post noted.\n\nIndulging the Tate brothers to own the libs is an act of pure nihilism. The Tate brothers are a uniquely malevolent force on the viral internet. Denouncing them should be the easiest test of moral seriousness imaginable, and yet it’s a test that many online influencers are failing in real time. Then again, perhaps we shouldn’t be that shocked that much of the MAGA movement would embrace a boastful bully accused of multiple sexual offenses, who once ran a scammy university. After all, look at who they put in the White House.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "It’s time to stop fooling ourselves, says a woman who left a position of power: the women who have managed to be both mothers and top professionals are superhuman, rich, or self-employed. If we truly believe in equal opportunity for all women, here’s what has to change.\n\nEighteen months into my job as the first woman director of policy planning at the State Department, a foreign-policy dream job that traces its origins back to George Kennan, I found myself in New York, at the United Nations’ annual assemblage of every foreign minister and head of state in the world. On a Wednesday evening, President and Mrs. Obama hosted a glamorous reception at the American Museum of Natural History. I sipped champagne, greeted foreign dignitaries, and mingled. But I could not stop thinking about my 14-year-old son, who had started eighth grade three weeks earlier and was already resuming what had become his pattern of skipping homework, disrupting classes, failing math, and tuning out any adult who tried to reach him. Over the summer, we had barely spoken to each other—or, more accurately, he had barely spoken to me. And the previous spring I had received several urgent phone calls—invariably on the day of an important meeting—that required me to take the first train from Washington, D.C., where I worked, back to Princeton, New Jersey, where he lived. My husband, who has always done everything possible to support my career, took care of him and his 12-year-old brother during the week; outside of those midweek emergencies, I came home only on weekends.\n\nAs the evening wore on, I ran into a colleague who held a senior position in the White House. She has two sons exactly my sons’ ages, but she had chosen to move them from California to D.C. when she got her job, which meant her husband commuted back to California regularly. I told her how difficult I was finding it to be away from my son when he clearly needed me. Then I said, “When this is over, I’m going to write an op-ed titled ‘Women Can’t Have It All.’”\n\nShe was horrified. “You can’t write that,” she said. “You, of all people.” What she meant was that such a statement, coming from a high-profile career woman—a role model—would be a terrible signal to younger generations of women. By the end of the evening, she had talked me out of it, but for the remainder of my stint in Washington, I was increasingly aware that the feminist beliefs on which I had built my entire career were shifting under my feet. I had always assumed that if I could get a foreign-policy job in the State Department or the White House while my party was in power, I would stay the course as long as I had the opportunity to do work I loved. But in January 2011, when my two-year public-service leave from Princeton University was up, I hurried home as fast as I could.\n\nA rude epiphany hit me soon after I got there. When people asked why I had left government, I explained that I’d come home not only because of Princeton’s rules (after two years of leave, you lose your tenure), but also because of my desire to be with my family and my conclusion that juggling high-level government work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible. I have not exactly left the ranks of full-time career women: I teach a full course load; write regular print and online columns on foreign policy; give 40 to 50 speeches a year; appear regularly on TV and radio; and am working on a new academic book. But I routinely got reactions from other women my age or older that ranged from disappointed (“It’s such a pity that you had to leave Washington”) to condescending (“I wouldn’t generalize from your experience. I’ve never had to compromise, and my kids turned out great”).\n\nThe first set of reactions, with the underlying assumption that my choice was somehow sad or unfortunate, was irksome enough. But it was the second set of reactions—those implying that my parenting and/or my commitment to my profession were somehow substandard—that triggered a blind fury. Suddenly, finally, the penny dropped. All my life, I’d been on the other side of this exchange. I’d been the woman smiling the faintly superior smile while another woman told me she had decided to take some time out or pursue a less competitive career track so that she could spend more time with her family. I’d been the woman congratulating herself on her unswerving commitment to the feminist cause, chatting smugly with her dwindling number of college or law-school friends who had reached and maintained their place on the highest rungs of their profession. I’d been the one telling young women at my lectures that you can have it all and do it all, regardless of what field you are in. Which means I’d been part, albeit unwittingly, of making millions of women feel that they are to blame if they cannot manage to rise up the ladder as fast as men and also have a family and an active home life (and be thin and beautiful to boot).\n\nVIDEO: Anne-Marie Slaughter talks with Hanna Rosin about the struggles of working mothers.\n\nLast spring, I flew to Oxford to give a public lecture. At the request of a young Rhodes Scholar I know, I’d agreed to talk to the Rhodes community about “work-family balance.” I ended up speaking to a group of about 40 men and women in their mid-20s. What poured out of me was a set of very frank reflections on how unexpectedly hard it was to do the kind of job I wanted to do as a high government official and be the kind of parent I wanted to be, at a demanding time for my children (even though my husband, an academic, was willing to take on the lion’s share of parenting for the two years I was in Washington). I concluded by saying that my time in office had convinced me that further government service would be very unlikely while my sons were still at home. The audience was rapt, and asked many thoughtful questions. One of the first was from a young woman who began by thanking me for “not giving just one more fatuous ‘You can have it all’ talk.” Just about all of the women in that room planned to combine careers and family in some way. But almost all assumed and accepted that they would have to make compromises that the men in their lives were far less likely to have to make.\n\nThe striking gap between the responses I heard from those young women (and others like them) and the responses I heard from my peers and associates prompted me to write this article. Women of my generation have clung to the feminist credo we were raised with, even as our ranks have been steadily thinned by unresolvable tensions between family and career, because we are determined not to drop the flag for the next generation. But when many members of the younger generation have stopped listening, on the grounds that glibly repeating “you can have it all” is simply airbrushing reality, it is time to talk.\n\nI still strongly believe that women can “have it all” (and that men can too). I believe that we can “have it all at the same time.” But not today, not with the way America’s economy and society are currently structured. My experiences over the past three years have forced me to confront a number of uncomfortable facts that need to be widely acknowledged—and quickly changed.\n\nBefore my service in government, I’d spent my career in academia: as a law professor and then as the dean of Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Both were demanding jobs, but I had the ability to set my own schedule most of the time. I could be with my kids when I needed to be, and still get the work done. I had to travel frequently, but I found I could make up for that with an extended period at home or a family vacation.\n\nI knew that I was lucky in my career choice, but I had no idea how lucky until I spent two years in Washington within a rigid bureaucracy, even with bosses as understanding as Hillary Clinton and her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills. My workweek started at 4:20 on Monday morning, when I got up to get the 5:30 train from Trenton to Washington. It ended late on Friday, with the train home. In between, the days were crammed with meetings, and when the meetings stopped, the writing work began—a never-ending stream of memos, reports, and comments on other people’s drafts. For two years, I never left the office early enough to go to any stores other than those open 24 hours, which meant that everything from dry cleaning to hair appointments to Christmas shopping had to be done on weekends, amid children’s sporting events, music lessons, family meals, and conference calls. I was entitled to four hours of vacation per pay period, which came to one day of vacation a month. And I had it better than many of my peers in D.C.; Secretary Clinton deliberately came in around 8 a.m. and left around 7 p.m., to allow her close staff to have morning and evening time with their families (although of course she worked earlier and later, from home).\n\nIn short, the minute I found myself in a job that is typical for the vast majority of working women (and men), working long hours on someone else’s schedule, I could no longer be both the parent and the professional I wanted to be—at least not with a child experiencing a rocky adolescence. I realized what should have perhaps been obvious: having it all, at least for me, depended almost entirely on what type of job I had. The flip side is the harder truth: having it all was not possible in many types of jobs, including high government office—at least not for very long.\n\nI am hardly alone in this realization. Michèle Flournoy stepped down after three years as undersecretary of defense for policy, the third-highest job in the department, to spend more time at home with her three children, two of whom are teenagers. Karen Hughes left her position as the counselor to President George W. Bush after a year and a half in Washington to go home to Texas for the sake of her family. Mary Matalin, who spent two years as an assistant to Bush and the counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney before stepping down to spend more time with her daughters, wrote: “Having control over your schedule is the only way that women who want to have a career and a family can make it work.”\n\nYet the decision to step down from a position of power—to value family over professional advancement, even for a time—is directly at odds with the prevailing social pressures on career professionals in the United States. One phrase says it all about current attitudes toward work and family, particularly among elites. In Washington, “leaving to spend time with your family” is a euphemism for being fired. This understanding is so ingrained that when Flournoy announced her resignation last December, TheNew York Times covered her decision as follows:\n\nMs. Flournoy’s announcement surprised friends and a number of Pentagon officials, but all said they took her reason for resignation at face value and not as a standard Washington excuse for an official who has in reality been forced out. “I can absolutely and unequivocally state that her decision to step down has nothing to do with anything other than her commitment to her family,” said Doug Wilson, a top Pentagon spokesman. “She has loved this job and people here love her.\n\nThink about what this “standard Washington excuse” implies: it is so unthinkable that an official would actually step down to spend time with his or her family that this must be a cover for something else. How could anyone voluntarily leave the circles of power for the responsibilities of parenthood? Depending on one’s vantage point, it is either ironic or maddening that this view abides in the nation’s capital, despite the ritual commitments to “family values” that are part of every political campaign. Regardless, this sentiment makes true work-life balance exceptionally difficult. But it cannot change unless top women speak out.\n\nOnly recently have I begun to appreciate the extent to which many young professional women feel under assault by women my age and older. After I gave a recent speech in New York, several women in their late 60s or early 70s came up to tell me how glad and proud they were to see me speaking as a foreign-policy expert. A couple of them went on, however, to contrast my career with the path being traveled by “younger women today.” One expressed dismay that many younger women “are just not willing to get out there and do it.” Said another, unaware of the circumstances of my recent job change: “They think they have to choose between having a career and having a family.”\n\nA similar assumption underlies Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg’s widely publicized 2011 commencement speech at Barnard, and her earlier TED talk, in which she lamented the dismally small number of women at the top and advised young women not to “leave before you leave.” When a woman starts thinking about having children, Sandberg said, “she doesn’t raise her hand anymore … She starts leaning back.” Although couched in terms of encouragement, Sandberg’s exhortation contains more than a note of reproach. We who have made it to the top, or are striving to get there, are essentially saying to the women in the generation behind us: “What’s the matter with you?”\n\nThey have an answer that we don’t want to hear. After the speech I gave in New York, I went to dinner with a group of 30-somethings. I sat across from two vibrant women, one of whom worked at the UN and the other at a big New York law firm. As nearly always happens in these situations, they soon began asking me about work-life balance. When I told them I was writing this article, the lawyer said, “I look for role models and can’t find any.” She said the women in her firm who had become partners and taken on management positions had made tremendous sacrifices, “many of which they don’t even seem to realize … They take two years off when their kids are young but then work like crazy to get back on track professionally, which means that they see their kids when they are toddlers but not teenagers, or really barely at all.” Her friend nodded, mentioning the top professional women she knew, all of whom essentially relied on round-the-clock nannies. Both were very clear that they did not want that life, but could not figure out how to combine professional success and satisfaction with a real commitment to family.\n\nI realize that I am blessed to have been born in the late 1950s instead of the early 1930s, as my mother was, or the beginning of the 20th century, as my grandmothers were. My mother built a successful and rewarding career as a professional artist largely in the years after my brothers and I left home—and after being told in her 20s that she could not go to medical school, as her father had done and her brother would go on to do, because, of course, she was going to get married. I owe my own freedoms and opportunities to the pioneering generation of women ahead of me—the women now in their 60s, 70s, and 80s who faced overt sexism of a kind I see only when watching Mad Men, and who knew that the only way to make it as a woman was to act exactly like a man. To admit to, much less act on, maternal longings would have been fatal to their careers.\n\nBut precisely thanks to their progress, a different kind of conversation is now possible. It is time for women in leadership positions to recognize that although we are still blazing trails and breaking ceilings, many of us are also reinforcing a falsehood: that “having it all” is, more than anything, a function of personal determination. As Kerry Rubin and Lia Macko, the authors of Midlife Crisis at 30, their cri de coeur for Gen-X and Gen-Y women, put it:\n\nWhat we discovered in our research is that while the empowerment part of the equation has been loudly celebrated, there has been very little honest discussion among women of our age about the real barriers and flaws that still exist in the system despite the opportunities we inherited.\n\nI am well aware that the majority of American women face problems far greater than any discussed in this article. I am writing for my demographic—highly educated, well-off women who are privileged enough to have choices in the first place. We may not have choices about whether to do paid work, as dual incomes have become indispensable. But we have choices about the type and tempo of the work we do. We are the women who could be leading, and who should be equally represented in the leadership ranks.\n\nMillions of other working women face much more difficult life circumstances. Some are single mothers; many struggle to find any job; others support husbands who cannot find jobs. Many cope with a work life in which good day care is either unavailable or very expensive; school schedules do not match work schedules; and schools themselves are failing to educate their children. Many of these women are worrying not about having it all, but rather about holding on to what they do have. And although women as a group have made substantial gains in wages, educational attainment, and prestige over the past three decades, the economists Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson have shown that women are less happy today than their predecessors were in 1972, both in absolute terms and relative to men.\n\nThe best hope for improving the lot of all women, and for closing what Wolfers and Stevenson call a “new gender gap”—measured by well-being rather than wages—is to close the leadership gap: to elect a woman president and 50 women senators; to ensure that women are equally represented in the ranks of corporate executives and judicial leaders. Only when women wield power in sufficient numbers will we create a society that genuinely works for all women. That will be a society that works for everyone.\n\nThe Half-Truths We Hold Dear\n\nLet’s briefly examine the stories we tell ourselves, the clichés that I and many other women typically fall back on when younger women ask us how we have managed to “have it all.” They are not necessarily lies, but at best partial truths. We must clear them out of the way to make room for a more honest and productive discussion about real solutions to the problems faced by professional women.\n\nIt’s possible if you are just committed enough.\n\nOur usual starting point, whether we say it explicitly or not, is that having it all depends primarily on the depth and intensity of a woman’s commitment to her career. That is precisely the sentiment behind the dismay so many older career women feel about the younger generation. They are not committed enough, we say, to make the trade-offs and sacrifices that the women ahead of them made.\n\nYet instead of chiding, perhaps we should face some basic facts. Very few women reach leadership positions. The pool of female candidates for any top job is small, and will only grow smaller if the women who come after us decide to take time out, or drop out of professional competition altogether, to raise children. That is exactly what has Sheryl Sandberg so upset, and rightly so. In her words, “Women are not making it to the top. A hundred and ninety heads of state; nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. In the corporate sector, [the share of] women at the top—C-level jobs, board seats—tops out at 15, 16 percent.”\n\nWhat’s more, among those who have made it to the top, a balanced life still is more elusive for women than it is for men. A simple measure is how many women in top positions have children compared with their male colleagues. Every male Supreme Court justice has a family. Two of the three female justices are single with no children. And the third, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, began her career as a judge only when her younger child was almost grown. The pattern is the same at the National Security Council: Condoleezza Rice, the first and only woman national-security adviser, is also the only national-security adviser since the 1950s not to have a family. Can “insufficient commitment” even plausibly explain these numbers? To be sure, the women who do make it to the top are highly committed to their profession. On closer examination, however, it turns out that most of them have something else in common: they are genuine superwomen. Consider the number of women recently in the top ranks in Washington—Susan Rice, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Michelle Gavin, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle—who are Rhodes Scholars. Samantha Power, another senior White House official, won a Pulitzer Prize at age 32. Or consider Sandberg herself, who graduated with the prize given to Harvard’s top student of economics. These women cannot possibly be the standard against which even very talented professional women should measure themselves. Such a standard sets up most women for a sense of failure.\n\nThe line of high-level women appointees in the Obama administration is one woman deep. Virtually all of us who have stepped down have been succeeded by men; searches for women to succeed men in similar positions come up empty. Just about every woman who could plausibly be tapped is already in government. The rest of the foreign-policy world is not much better; Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, recently surveyed the best data he could find across the government, the military, the academy, and think tanks, and found that women hold fewer than 30 percent of the senior foreign-policy positions in each of these institutions.\n\nThese numbers are all the more striking when we look back to the 1980s, when women now in their late 40s and 50s were coming out of graduate school, and remember that our classes were nearly 50-50 men and women. We were sure then that by now, we would be living in a 50-50 world. Something derailed that dream.\n\nSandberg thinks that “something” is an “ambition gap”—that women do not dream big enough. I am all for encouraging young women to reach for the stars. But I fear that the obstacles that keep women from reaching the top are rather more prosaic than the scope of their ambition. My longtime and invaluable assistant, who has a doctorate and juggles many balls as the mother of teenage twins, e-mailed me while I was working on this article: “You know what would help the vast majority of women with work/family balance? MAKE SCHOOL SCHEDULES MATCH WORK SCHEDULES.” The present system, she noted, is based on a society that no longer exists—one in which farming was a major occupation and stay-at-home moms were the norm. Yet the system hasn’t changed.\n\nConsider some of the responses of women interviewed by Zenko about why “women are significantly underrepresented in foreign policy and national security positions in government, academia, and think tanks.” Juliette Kayyem, who served as an assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2011 and now writes a foreign-policy and national-security column for The Boston Globe, told Zenko that among other reasons,\n\nthe basic truth is also this: the travel sucks. As my youngest of three children is now 6, I can look back at the years when they were all young and realize just how disruptive all the travel was. There were also trips I couldn’t take because I was pregnant or on leave, the conferences I couldn’t attend because (note to conference organizers: weekends are a bad choice) kids would be home from school, and the various excursions that were offered but just couldn’t be managed.\n\nJolynn Shoemaker, the director of Women in International Security, agreed: “Inflexible schedules, unrelenting travel, and constant pressure to be in the office are common features of these jobs.”\n\nThese “mundane” issues—the need to travel constantly to succeed, the conflicts between school schedules and work schedules, the insistence that work be done in the office—cannot be solved by exhortations to close the ambition gap. I would hope to see commencement speeches that finger America’s social and business policies, rather than women’s level of ambition, in explaining the dearth of women at the top. But changing these policies requires much more than speeches. It means fighting the mundane battles—every day, every year—in individual workplaces, in legislatures, and in the media.\n\nIt’s possible if you marry the right person.\n\nSandberg’s second message in her Barnard commencement address was: “The most important career decision you’re going to make is whether or not you have a life partner and who that partner is.” Lisa Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, recently drove that message home to an audience of Princeton students and alumni gathered to hear her acceptance speech for the James Madison Medal. During the Q&A session, an audience member asked her how she managed her career and her family. She laughed and pointed to her husband in the front row, saying: “There’s my work-life balance.” I could never have had the career I have had without my husband, Andrew Moravcsik, who is a tenured professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton. Andy has spent more time with our sons than I have, not only on homework, but also on baseball, music lessons, photography, card games, and more. When each of them had to bring in a foreign dish for his fourth-grade class dinner, Andy made his grandmother’s Hungarian palacsinta; when our older son needed to memorize his lines for a lead role in a school play, he turned to Andy for help.\n\nStill, the proposition that women can have high-powered careers as long as their husbands or partners are willing to share the parenting load equally (or disproportionately) assumes that most women will feel as comfortable as men do about being away from their children, as long as their partner is home with them. In my experience, that is simply not the case.\n\nHere I step onto treacherous ground, mined with stereotypes. From years of conversations and observations, however, I’ve come to believe that men and women respond quite differently when problems at home force them to recognize that their absence is hurting a child, or at least that their presence would likely help. I do not believe fathers love their children any less than mothers do, but men do seem more likely to choose their job at a cost to their family, while women seem more likely to choose their family at a cost to their job.\n\nMany factors determine this choice, of course. Men are still socialized to believe that their primary family obligation is to be the breadwinner; women, to believe that their primary family obligation is to be the caregiver. But it may be more than that. When I described the choice between my children and my job to Senator Jeanne Shaheen, she said exactly what I felt: “There’s really no choice.” She wasn’t referring to social expectations, but to a maternal imperative felt so deeply that the “choice” is reflexive.\n\nMen and women also seem to frame the choice differently. In Midlife Crisis at 30, Mary Matalin recalls her days working as President Bush’s assistant and Vice President Cheney’s counselor:\n\nEven when the stress was overwhelming—those days when I’d cry in the car on the way to work, asking myself “Why am I doing this??”—I always knew the answer to that question: I believe in this president.\n\nBut Matalin goes on to describe her choice to leave in words that are again uncannily similar to the explanation I have given so many people since leaving the State Department:\n\nI finally asked myself, “Who needs me more?” And that’s when I realized, it’s somebody else’s turn to do this job. I’m indispensable to my kids, but I’m not close to indispensable to the White House.\n\nTo many men, however, the choice to spend more time with their children, instead of working long hours on issues that affect many lives, seems selfish. Male leaders are routinely praised for having sacrificed their personal life on the altar of public or corporate service. That sacrifice, of course, typically involves their family. Yet their children, too, are trained to value public service over private responsibility. At the diplomat Richard Holbrooke’s memorial service, one of his sons told the audience that when he was a child, his father was often gone, not around to teach him to throw a ball or to watch his games. But as he grew older, he said, he realized that Holbrooke’s absence was the price of saving people around the world—a price worth paying.\n\nIt is not clear to me that this ethical framework makes sense for society. Why should we want leaders who fall short on personal responsibilities? Perhaps leaders who invested time in their own families would be more keenly aware of the toll their public choices—on issues from war to welfare—take on private lives. (Kati Marton, Holbrooke’s widow and a noted author, says that although Holbrooke adored his children, he came to appreciate the full importance of family only in his 50s, at which point he became a very present parent and grandparent, while continuing to pursue an extraordinary public career.) Regardless, it is clear which set of choices society values more today. Workers who put their careers first are typically rewarded; workers who choose their families are overlooked, disbelieved, or accused of unprofessionalism.\n\nIn sum, having a supportive mate may well be a necessary condition if women are to have it all, but it is not sufficient. If women feel deeply that turning down a promotion that would involve more travel, for instance, is the right thing to do, then they will continue to do that. Ultimately, it is society that must change, coming to value choices to put family ahead of work just as much as those to put work ahead of family. If we really valued those choices, we would value the people who make them; if we valued the people who make them, we would do everything possible to hire and retain them; if we did everything possible to allow them to combine work and family equally over time, then the choices would get a lot easier.\n\nIt’s possible if you sequence it right.\n\nYoung women should be wary of the assertion “You can have it all; you just can’t have it all at once.” This 21st-century addendum to the original line is now proffered by many senior women to their younger mentees. To the extent that it means, in the words of one working mother, “I’m going to do my best and I’m going to keep the long term in mind and know that it’s not always going to be this hard to balance,” it is sound advice. But to the extent that it means that women can have it all if they just find the right sequence of career and family, it’s cheerfully wrong.\n\nThe most important sequencing issue is when to have children. Many of the top women leaders of the generation just ahead of me—Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O’Connor, Patricia Wald, Nannerl Keohane—had their children in their 20s and early 30s, as was the norm in the 1950s through the 1970s. A child born when his mother is 25 will finish high school when his mother is 43, an age at which, with full-time immersion in a career, she still has plenty of time and energy for advancement.\n\nYet this sequence has fallen out of favor with many high-potential women, and understandably so. People tend to marry later now, and anyway, if you have children earlier, you may have difficulty getting a graduate degree, a good first job, and opportunities for advancement in the crucial early years of your career. Making matters worse, you will also have less income while raising your children, and hence less ability to hire the help that can be indispensable to your juggling act.\n\nWhen I was the dean, the Woodrow Wilson School created a program called Pathways to Public Service, aimed at advising women whose children were almost grown about how to go into public service, and many women still ask me about the best “on-ramps” to careers in their mid-40s. Honestly, I’m not sure what to tell most of them. Unlike the pioneering women who entered the workforce after having children in the 1970s, these women are competing with their younger selves. Government and NGO jobs are an option, but many careers are effectively closed off. Personally, I have never seen a woman in her 40s enter the academic market successfully, or enter a law firm as a junior associate, Alicia Florrick of The Good Wife notwithstanding.\n\nThese considerations are why so many career women of my generation chose to establish themselves in their careers first and have children in their mid-to-late 30s. But that raises the possibility of spending long, stressful years and a small fortune trying to have a baby. I lived that nightmare: for three years, beginning at age 35, I did everything possible to conceive and was frantic at the thought that I had simply left having a biological child until it was too late.\n\nAnd when everything does work out? I had my first child at 38 (and counted myself blessed) and my second at 40. That means I will be 58 when both of my children are out of the house. What’s more, it means that many peak career opportunities are coinciding precisely with their teenage years, when, experienced parents advise, being available as a parent is just as important as in the first years of a child’s life.\n\nMany women of my generation have found themselves, in the prime of their careers, saying no to opportunities they once would have jumped at and hoping those chances come around again later. Many others who have decided to step back for a while, taking on consultant positions or part-time work that lets them spend more time with their children (or aging parents), are worrying about how long they can “stay out” before they lose the competitive edge they worked so hard to acquire.\n\nGiven the way our work culture is oriented today, I recommend establishing yourself in your career first but still trying to have kids before you are 35—or else freeze your eggs, whether you are married or not. You may well be a more mature and less frustrated parent in your 30s or 40s; you are also more likely to have found a lasting life partner. But the truth is, neither sequence is optimal, and both involve trade-offs that men do not have to make.\n\nYou should be able to have a family if you want one—however and whenever your life circumstances allow—and still have the career you desire. If more women could strike this balance, more women would reach leadership positions. And if more women were in leadership positions, they could make it easier for more women to stay in the workforce. The rest of this essay details how.\n\nChanging the Culture of Face Time\n\nBack in the Reagan administration, a New York Times story about the ferociously competitive budget director Dick Darman reported, “Mr. Darman sometimes managed to convey the impression that he was the last one working in the Reagan White House by leaving his suit coat on his chair and his office light burning after he left for home.” (Darman claimed that it was just easier to leave his suit jacket in the office so he could put it on again in the morning, but his record of psychological manipulation suggests otherwise.)\n\nThe culture of “time macho”—a relentless competition to work harder, stay later, pull more all-nighters, travel around the world and bill the extra hours that the international date line affords you—remains astonishingly prevalent among professionals today. Nothing captures the belief that more time equals more value better than the cult of billable hours afflicting large law firms across the country and providing exactly the wrong incentives for employees who hope to integrate work and family. Yet even in industries that don’t explicitly reward sheer quantity of hours spent on the job, the pressure to arrive early, stay late, and be available, always, for in-person meetings at 11 a.m. on Saturdays can be intense. Indeed, by some measures, the problem has gotten worse over time: a study by the Center for American Progress reports that nationwide, the share of all professionals—women and men—working more than 50 hours a week has increased since the late 1970s.\n\nBut more time in the office does not always mean more “value added”—and it does not always add up to a more successful organization. In 2009, Sandra Pocharski, a senior female partner at Monitor Group and the head of the firm’s Leadership and Organization practice, commissioned a Harvard Business School professor to assess the factors that helped or hindered women’s effectiveness and advancement at Monitor. The study found that the company’s culture was characterized by an “always on” mode of working, often without due regard to the impact on employees. Pocharski observed:\n\nClients come first, always, and sometimes burning the midnight oil really does make the difference between success and failure. But sometimes we were just defaulting to behavior that overloaded our people without improving results much, if at all. We decided we needed managers to get better at distinguishing between these categories, and to recognize the hidden costs of assuming that “time is cheap.” When that time doesn’t add a lot of value and comes at a high cost to talented employees, who will leave when the personal cost becomes unsustainable—well, that is clearly a bad outcome for everyone.\n\nI have worked very long hours and pulled plenty of all-nighters myself over the course of my career, including a few nights on my office couch during my two years in D.C. Being willing to put the time in when the job simply has to get done is rightfully a hallmark of a successful professional. But looking back, I have to admit that my assumption that I would stay late made me much less efficient over the course of the day than I might have been, and certainly less so than some of my colleagues, who managed to get the same amount of work done and go home at a decent hour. If Dick Darman had had a boss who clearly valued prioritization and time management, he might have found reason to turn out the lights and take his jacket home.\n\nLong hours are one thing, and realistically, they are often unavoidable. But do they really need to be spent at the office? To be sure, being in the office some of the time is beneficial. In-person meetings can be far more efficient than phone or e-mail tag; trust and collegiality are much more easily built up around the same physical table; and spontaneous conversations often generate good ideas and lasting relationships. Still, armed with e-mail, instant messaging, phones, and videoconferencing technology, we should be able to move to a culture where the office is a base of operations more than the required locus of work.\n\nBeing able to work from home—in the evening after children are put to bed, or during their sick days or snow days, and at least some of the time on weekends—can be the key, for mothers, to carrying your full load versus letting a team down at crucial moments. State-of-the-art videoconferencing facilities can dramatically reduce the need for long business trips. These technologies are making inroads, and allowing easier integration of work and family life. According to the Women’s Business Center, 61 percent of women business owners use technology to “integrate the responsibilities of work and home”; 44 percent use technology to allow employees “to work off-site or to have flexible work schedules.” Yet our work culture still remains more office-centered than it needs to be, especially in light of technological advances.\n\nOne way to change that is by changing the “default rules” that govern office work—the baseline expectations about when, where, and how work will be done. As behavioral economists well know, these baselines can make an enormous difference in the way people act. It is one thing, for instance, for an organization to allow phone-ins to a meeting on an ad hoc basis, when parenting and work schedules collide—a system that’s better than nothing, but likely to engender guilt among those calling in, and possibly resentment among those in the room. It is quite another for that organization to declare that its policy will be to schedule in-person meetings, whenever possible, during the hours of the school day—a system that might normalize call-ins for those (rarer) meetings still held in the late afternoon.\n\nOne real-world example comes from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a place most people are more likely to associate with distinguished gentlemen in pinstripes than with progressive thinking about work-family balance. Like so many other places, however, the FCO worries about losing talented members of two-career couples around the world, particularly women. So it recently changed its basic policy from a default rule that jobs have to be done on-site to one that assumes that some jobs might be done remotely, and invites workers to make the case for remote work. Kara Owen, a career foreign-service officer who was the FCO’s diversity director and will soon become the British deputy ambassador to France, writes that she has now done two remote jobs. Before her current maternity leave, she was working a London job from Dublin to be with her partner, using teleconferencing technology and timing her trips to London to coincide “with key meetings where I needed to be in the room (or chatting at the pre-meeting coffee) to have an impact, or to do intensive ‘network maintenance.’” In fact, she writes, “I have found the distance and quiet to be a real advantage in a strategic role, providing I have put in the investment up front to develop very strong personal relationships with the game changers.” Owen recognizes that not every job can be done this way. But she says that for her part, she has been able to combine family requirements with her career.\n\nChanges in default office rules should not advantage parents over other workers; indeed, done right, they can improve relations among co-workers by raising their awareness of each other’s circumstances and instilling a sense of fairness. Two years ago, the ACLU Foundation of Massachusetts decided to replace its “parental leave” policy with a “family leave” policy that provides for as much as 12 weeks of leave not only for new parents, but also for employees who need to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition. According to Director Carol Rose, “We wanted a policy that took into account the fact that even employees who do not have children have family obligations.” The policy was shaped by the belief that giving women “special treatment” can “backfire if the broader norms shaping the behavior of all employees do not change.” When I was the dean of the Wilson School, I managed with the mantra “Family comes first”—any family—and found that my employees were both productive and intensely loyal.\n\nNone of these changes will happen by themselves, and reasons to avoid them will seldom be hard to find. But obstacles and inertia are usually surmountable if leaders are open to changing their assumptions about the workplace. The use of technology in many high-level government jobs, for instance, is complicated by the need to have access to classified information. But in 2009, Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, who shares the parenting of his two young daughters equally with his wife, made getting such access at home an immediate priority so that he could leave the office at a reasonable hour and participate in important meetings via videoconferencing if necessary. I wonder how many women in similar positions would be afraid to ask, lest they be seen as insufficiently committed to their jobs.\n\nRevaluing Family Values\n\nWhile employers shouldn’t privilege parents over other workers, too often they end up doing the opposite, usually subtly, and usually in ways that make it harder for a primary caregiver to get ahead. Many people in positions of power seem to place a low value on child care in comparison with other outside activities. Consider the following proposition: An employer has two equally talented and productive employees. One trains for and runs marathons when he is not working. The other takes care of two children. What assumptions is the employer likely to make about the marathon runner? That he gets up in the dark every day and logs an hour or two running before even coming into the office, or drives himself to get out there even after a long day. That he is ferociously disciplined and willing to push himself through distraction, exhaustion, and days when nothing seems to go right in the service of a goal far in the distance. That he must manage his time exceptionally well to squeeze all of that in.\n\nBe honest: Do you think the employer makes those same assumptions about the parent? Even though she likely rises in the dark hours before she needs to be at work, organizes her children’s day, makes breakfast, packs lunch, gets them off to school, figures out shopping and other errands even if she is lucky enough to have a housekeeper—and does much the same work at the end of the day. Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton’s indefatigable chief of staff, has twins in elementary school; even with a fully engaged husband, she famously gets up at four every morning to check and send e-mails before her kids wake up. Louise Richardson, now the vice chancellor of the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland, combined an assistant professorship in government at Harvard with mothering three young children. She organized her time so ruthlessly that she always keyed in 1:11 or 2:22 or 3:33 on the microwave rather than 1:00, 2:00, or 3:00, because hitting the same number three times took less time.\n\nElizabeth Warren, who is now running for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, has a similar story. When she had two young children and a part-time law practice, she struggled to find enough time to write the papers and articles that would help get her an academic position. In her words:\n\nI needed a plan. I figured out that writing time was when Alex was asleep. So the minute I put him down for a nap or he fell asleep in the baby swing, I went to my desk and started working on something—footnotes, reading, outlining, writing … I learned to do everything else with a baby on my hip.\n\nThe discipline, organization, and sheer endurance it takes to succeed at top levels with young children at home is easily comparable to running 20 to 40 miles a week. But that’s rarely how employers see things, not only when making allowances, but when making promotions. Perhaps because people choose to have children? People also choose to run marathons.\n\nOne final example: I have worked with many Orthodox Jewish men who observed the Sabbath from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday. Jack Lew, the two-time director of the Office of Management and Budget, former deputy secretary of state for management and resources, and now White House chief of staff, is a case in point. Jack’s wife lived in New York when he worked in the State Department, so he would leave the office early enough on Friday afternoon to take the shuttle to New York and a taxi to his apartment before sundown. He would not work on Friday after sundown or all day Saturday. Everyone who knew him, including me, admired his commitment to his faith and his ability to carve out the time for it, even with an enormously demanding job.\n\nIt is hard to imagine, however, that we would have the same response if a mother told us she was blocking out mid-Friday afternoon through the end of the day on Saturday, every week, to spend time with her children. I suspect this would be seen as unprofessional, an imposition of unnecessary costs on co-workers. In fact, of course, one of the great values of the Sabbath—whether Jewish or Christian—is precisely that it carves out a family oasis, with rituals and a mandatory setting-aside of work.\n\nOur assumptions are just that: things we believe that are not necessarily so. Yet what we assume has an enormous impact on our perceptions and responses. Fortunately, changing our assumptions is up to us.\n\nRedefining the Arc of a Successful Career\n\nThe American definition of a successful professional is someone who can climb the ladder the furthest in the shortest time, generally peaking between ages 45 and 55. It is a definition well suited to the mid-20th century, an era when people had kids in their 20s, stayed in one job, retired at 67, and were dead, on average, by age 71.\n\nIt makes far less sense today. Average life expectancy for people in their 20s has increased to 80; men and women in good health can easily work until they are 75. They can expect to have multiple jobs and even multiple careers throughout their working life. Couples marry later, have kids later, and can expect to live on two incomes. They may well retire earlier—the average retirement age has gone down from 67 to 63—but that is commonly “retirement” only in the sense of collecting retirement benefits. Many people go on to “encore” careers.\n\nAssuming the priceless gifts of good health and good fortune, a professional woman can thus expect her working life to stretch some 50 years, from her early or mid-20s to her mid-70s. It is reasonable to assume that she will build her credentials and establish herself, at least in her first career, between 22 and 35; she will have children, if she wants them, sometime between 25 and 45; she’ll want maximum flexibility and control over her time in the 10 years that her children are 8 to 18; and she should plan to take positions of maximum authority and demands on her time after her children are out of the house. Women who have children in their late 20s can expect to immerse themselves completely in their careers in their late 40s, with plenty of time still to rise to the top in their late 50s and early 60s. Women who make partner, managing director, or senior vice president; get tenure; or establish a medical practice before having children in their late 30s should be coming back on line for the most demanding jobs at almost exactly the same age.\n\nAlong the way, women should think about the climb to leadership not in terms of a straight upward slope, but as irregular stair steps, with periodic plateaus (and even dips) when they turn down promotions to remain in a job that works for their family situation; when they leave high-powered jobs and spend a year or two at home on a reduced schedule; or when they step off a conventional professional track to take a consulting position or project-based work for a number of years. I think of these plateaus as “investment intervals.” My husband and I took a sabbatical in Shanghai, from August 2007 to May 2008, right in the thick of an election year when many of my friends were advising various candidates on foreign-policy issues. We thought of the move in part as “putting money in the family bank,” taking advantage of the opportunity to spend a close year together in a foreign culture. But we were also investing in our children’s ability to learn Mandarin and in our own knowledge of Asia.\n\nPeaking in your late 50s and early 60s rather than your late 40s and early 50s makes particular sense for women, who live longer than men. And many of the stereotypes about older workers simply do not hold. A 2006 survey of human-resources professionals shows that only 23 percent think older workers are less flexible than younger workers; only 11 percent think older workers require more training than younger workers; and only 7 percent think older workers have less drive than younger workers.\n\nWhether women will really have the confidence to stair-step their careers, however, will again depend in part on perceptions. Slowing down the rate of promotions, taking time out periodically, pursuing an alternative path during crucial parenting or parent-care years—all have to become more visible and more noticeably accepted as a pause rather than an opt-out. (In an encouraging sign, Mass Career Customization, a 2007 book by Cathleen Benko and Anne Weisberg arguing that “today’s career is no longer a straight climb up the corporate ladder, but rather a combination of climbs, lateral moves, and planned descents,” was a Wall Street Journal best seller.)\n\nInstitutions can also take concrete steps to promote this acceptance. For instance, in 1970, Princeton established a tenure-extension policy that allowed female assistant professors expecting a child to request a one-year extension on their tenure clocks. This policy was later extended to men, and broadened to include adoptions. In the early 2000s, two reports on the status of female faculty discovered that only about 3 percent of assistant professors requested tenure extensions in a given year. And in response to a survey question, women were much more likely than men to think that a tenure extension would be detrimental to an assistant professor’s career.\n\nSo in 2005, under President Shirley Tilghman, Princeton changed the default rule. The administration announced that all assistant professors, female and male, who had a new child would automatically receive a one-year extension on the tenure clock, with no opt-outs allowed. Instead, assistant professors could request early consideration for tenure if they wished. The number of assistant professors who receive a tenure extension has tripled since the change.\n\nOne of the best ways to move social norms in this direction is to choose and celebrate different role models. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and I are poles apart politically, but he went way up in my estimation when he announced that one reason he decided against running for president in 2012 was the impact his campaign would have had on his children. He reportedly made clear at a fund-raiser in Louisiana that he didn’t want to be away from his children for long periods of time; according to a Republican official at the event, he said that “his son [missed] him after being gone for the three days on the road, and that he needed to get back.” He may not get my vote if and when he does run for president, but he definitely gets my admiration (providing he doesn’t turn around and join the GOP ticket this fall).\n\nIf we are looking for high-profile female role models, we might begin with Michelle Obama. She started out with the same résumé as her husband, but has repeatedly made career decisions designed to let her do work she cared about and also be the kind of parent she wanted to be. She moved from a high-powered law firm first to Chicago city government and then to the University of Chicago shortly before her daughters were born, a move that let her work only 10 minutes away from home. She has spoken publicly and often about her initial concerns that her husband’s entry into politics would be bad for their family life, and about her determination to limit her participation in the presidential election campaign to have more time at home. Even as first lady, she has been adamant that she be able to balance her official duties with family time. We should see her as a full-time career woman, but one who is taking a very visible investment interval. We should celebrate her not only as a wife, mother, and champion of healthy eating, but also as a woman who has had the courage and judgment to invest in her daughters when they need her most. And we should expect a glittering career from her after she leaves the White House and her daughters leave for college.\n\nRediscovering the Pursuit of Happiness\n\nOne of the most complicated and surprising parts of my journey out of Washington was coming to grips with what I really wanted. I had opportunities to stay on, and I could have tried to work out an arrangement allowing me to spend more time at home. I might have been able to get my family to join me in Washington for a year; I might have been able to get classified technology installed at my house the way Jim Steinberg did; I might have been able to commute only four days a week instead of five. (While this last change would have still left me very little time at home, given the intensity of my job, it might have made the job doable for another year or two.) But I realized that I didn’t just need to go home. Deep down, I wanted to go home. I wanted to be able to spend time with my children in the last few years that they are likely to live at home, crucial years for their development into responsible, productive, happy, and caring adults. But also irreplaceable years for me to enjoy the simple pleasures of parenting—baseball games, piano recitals, waffle breakfasts, family trips, and goofy rituals. My older son is doing very well these days, but even when he gives us a hard time, as all teenagers do, being home to shape his choices and help him make good decisions is deeply satisfying.\n\nThe flip side of my realization is captured in Macko and Rubin’s ruminations on the importance of bringing the different parts of their lives together as 30-year-old women:\n\nIf we didn’t start to learn how to integrate our personal, social, and professional lives, we were about five years away from morphing into the angry woman on the other side of a mahogany desk who questions her staff’s work ethic after standard 12-hour workdays, before heading home to eat moo shoo pork in her lonely apartment.\n\nWomen have contributed to the fetish of the one-dimensional life, albeit by necessity. The pioneer generation of feminists walled off their personal lives from their professional personas to ensure that they could never be discriminated against for a lack of commitment to their work. When I was a law student in the 1980s, many women who were then climbing the legal hierarchy in New York firms told me that they never admitted to taking time out for a child’s doctor appointment or school performance, but instead invented a much more neutral excuse.\n\nToday, however, women in power can and should change that environment, although change is not easy. When I became dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, in 2002, I decided that one of the advantages of being a woman in power was that I could help change the norms by deliberately talking about my children and my desire to have a balanced life. Thus, I would end faculty meetings at 6 p.m. by saying that I had to go home for dinner; I would also make clear to all student organizations that I would not come to dinner with them, because I needed to be home from six to eight, but that I would often be willing to come back after eight for a meeting. I also once told the Dean’s Advisory Committee that the associate dean would chair the next session so I could go to a parent-teacher conference.\n\nAfter a few months of this, several female assistant professors showed up in my office quite agitated. “You have to stop talking about your kids,” one said. “You are not showing the gravitas that people expect from a dean, which is particularly damaging precisely because you are the first woman dean of the school.” I told them that I was doing it deliberately and continued my practice, but it is interesting that gravitas and parenthood don’t seem to go together.\n\nTen years later, whenever I am introduced at a lecture or other speaking engagement, I insist that the person introducing me mention that I have two sons. It seems odd to me to list degrees, awards, positions, and interests and not include the dimension of my life that is most important to me—and takes an enormous amount of my time. As Secretary Clinton once said in a television interview in Beijing when the interviewer asked her about Chelsea’s upcoming wedding: “That’s my real life.” But I notice that my male introducers are typically uncomfortable when I make the request. They frequently say things like “And she particularly wanted me to mention that she has two sons”—thereby drawing attention to the unusual nature of my request, when my entire purpose is to make family references routine and normal in professional life.\n\nThis does not mean that you should insist that your colleagues spend time cooing over pictures of your baby or listening to the prodigious accomplishments of your kindergartner. It does mean that if you are late coming in one week, because it is your turn to drive the kids to school, that you be honest about what you are doing. Indeed, Sheryl Sandberg recently acknowledged not only that she leaves work at 5:30 to have dinner with her family, but also that for many years she did not dare make this admission, even though she would of course make up the work time later in the evening. Her willingness to speak out now is a strong step in the right direction.\n\nSeeking out a more balanced life is not a women’s issue; balance would be better for us all. Bronnie Ware, an Australian blogger who worked for years in palliative care and is the author of the 2011 book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, writes that the regret she heard most often was “I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.” The second-most-common regret was “I wish I didn’t work so hard.” She writes: “This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children’s youth and their partner’s companionship.”\n\nJuliette Kayyem, who several years ago left the Department of Homeland Security soon after her husband, David Barron, left a high position in the Justice Department, says their joint decision to leave Washington and return to Boston sprang from their desire to work on the “happiness project,” meaning quality time with their three children. (She borrowed the term from her friend Gretchen Rubin, who wrote a best-selling book and now runs a blog with that name.)\n\nIt’s time to embrace a national happiness project. As a daughter of Charlottesville, Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson and the university he founded, I grew up with the Declaration of Independence in my blood. Last I checked, he did not declare American independence in the name of life, liberty, and professional success. Let us rediscover the pursuit of happiness, and let us start at home.\n\nInnovation Nation\n\nAs I write this, I can hear the reaction of some readers to many of the proposals in this essay: It’s all fine and well for a tenured professor to write about flexible working hours, investment intervals, and family-comes-first management. But what about the real world? Most American women cannot demand these things, particularly in a bad economy, and their employers have little incentive to grant them voluntarily. Indeed, the most frequent reaction I get in putting forth these ideas is that when the choice is whether to hire a man who will work whenever and wherever needed, or a woman who needs more flexibility, choosing the man will add more value to the company.\n\nIn fact, while many of these issues are hard to quantify and measure precisely, the statistics seem to tell a different story. A seminal study of 527 U.S. companies, published in the Academy of Management Journal in 2000, suggests that “organizations with more extensive work-family policies have higher perceived firm-level performance” among their industry peers. These findings accorded with a 2003 study conducted by Michelle Arthur at the University of New Mexico. Examining 130 announcements of family-friendly policies in The Wall Street Journal, Arthur found that the announcements alone significantly improved share prices. In 2011, a study on flexibility in the workplace by Ellen Galinsky, Kelly Sakai, and Tyler Wigton of the Families and Work Institute showed that increased flexibility correlates positively with job engagement, job satisfaction, employee retention, and employee health.\n\nThis is only a small sampling from a large and growing literature trying to pin down the relationship between family-friendly policies and economic performance. Other scholars have concluded that good family policies attract better talent, which in turn raises productivity, but that the policies themselves have no impact on productivity. Still others argue that results attributed to these policies are actually a function of good management overall. What is evident, however, is that many firms that recruit and train well-educated professional women are aware that when a woman leaves because of bad work-family balance, they are losing the money and time they invested in her.\n\nEven the legal industry, built around the billable hour, is taking notice. Deborah Epstein Henry, a former big-firm litigator, is now the president of Flex-Time Lawyers, a national consulting firm focused partly on strategies for the retention of female attorneys. In her book Law and Reorder, published by the American Bar Association in 2010, she describes a legal profession “where the billable hour no longer works”; where attorneys, judges, recruiters, and academics all agree that this system of compensation has perverted the industry, leading to brutal work hours, massive inefficiency, and highly inflated costs. The answer—already being deployed in different corners of the industry—is a combination of alternative fee structures, virtual firms, women-owned firms, and the outsourcing of discrete legal jobs to other jurisdictions. Women, and Generation X and Y lawyers more generally, are pushing for these changes on the supply side; clients determined to reduce legal fees and increase flexible service are pulling on the demand side. Slowly, change is happening.\n\nAt the core of all this is self-interest. Losing smart and motivated women not only diminishes a company’s talent pool; it also reduces the return on its investment in training and mentoring. In trying to address these issues, some firms are finding out that women’s ways of working may just be better ways of working, for employees and clients alike.\n\nExperts on creativity and innovation emphasize the value of encouraging nonlinear thinking and cultivating randomness by taking long walks or looking at your environment from unusual angles. In their new book, A New Culture of Learning: Cultivating the Imagination for a World of Constant Change, the innovation gurus John Seely Brown and Douglas Thomas write, “We believe that connecting play and imagination may be the single most important step in unleashing the new culture of learning.”\n\nSpace for play and imagination is exactly what emerges when rigid work schedules and hierarchies loosen up. Skeptics should consider the “California effect.” California is the cradle of American innovation—in technology, entertainment, sports, food, and lifestyles. It is also a place where people take leisure as seriously as they take work; where companies like Google deliberately encourage play, with Ping-Pong tables, light sabers, and policies that require employees to spend one day a week working on whatever they wish. Charles Baudelaire wrote: “Genius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will.” Google apparently has taken note.\n\nNo parent would mistake child care for childhood. Still, seeing the world anew through a child’s eyes can be a powerful source of stimulation. When the Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling wrote The Strategy of Conflict, a classic text applying game theory to conflicts among nations, he frequently drew on child-rearing for examples of when deterrence might succeed or fail. “It may be easier to articulate the peculiar difficulty of constraining [a ruler] by the use of threats,” he wrote, “when one is fresh from a vain attempt at using threats to keep a small child from hurting a dog or a small dog from hurting a child.”\n\nThe books I’ve read with my children, the silly movies I’ve watched, the games I’ve played, questions I’ve answered, and people I’ve met while parenting have broadened my world. Another axiom of the literature on innovation is that the more often people with different perspectives come together, the more likely creative ideas are to emerge. Giving workers the ability to integrate their non-work lives with their work—whether they spend that time mothering or marathoning—will open the door to a much wider range of influences and ideas.\n\nEnlisting Men\n\nPerhaps the most encouraging news of all for achieving the sorts of changes that I have proposed is that men are joining the cause. In commenting on a draft of this article, Martha Minow, the dean of the Harvard Law School, wrote me that one change she has observed during 30 years of teaching law at Harvard is that today many young men are asking questions about how they can manage a work-life balance. And more systematic research on Generation Y confirms that many more men than in the past are asking questions about how they are going to integrate active parenthood with their professional lives.\n\nAbstract aspirations are easier than concrete trade-offs, of course. These young men have not yet faced the question of whether they are prepared to give up that more prestigious clerkship or fellowship, decline a promotion, or delay their professional goals to spend more time with their children and to support their partner’s career.\n\nYet once work practices and work culture begin to evolve, those changes are likely to carry their own momentum. Kara Owen, the British foreign-service officer who worked a London job from Dublin, wrote me in an e-mail:\n\nI think the culture on flexible working started to change the minute the Board of Management (who were all men at the time) started to work flexibly—quite a few of them started working one day a week from home.\n\nMen have, of course, become much more involved parents over the past couple of decades, and that, too, suggests broad support for big changes in the way we balance work and family. It is noteworthy that both James Steinberg, deputy secretary of state, and William Lynn, deputy secretary of defense, stepped down two years into the Obama administration so that they could spend more time with their children (for real).\n\nGoing forward, women would do well to frame work-family balance in terms of the broader social and economic issues that affect both women and men. After all, we have a new generation of young men who have been raised by full-time working mothers. Let us presume, as I do with my sons, that they will understand “supporting their families” to mean more than earning money.\n\nI have been blessed to work with and be mentored by some extraordinary women. Watching Hillary Clinton in action makes me incredibly proud—of her intelligence, expertise, professionalism, charisma, and command of any audience. I get a similar rush when I see a front-page picture of Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, deep in conversation about some of the most important issues on the world stage; or of Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, standing up forcefully for the Syrian people in the Security Council.\n\nThese women are extraordinary role models. If I had a daughter, I would encourage her to look to them, and I want a world in which they are extraordinary but not unusual. Yet I also want a world in which, in Lisa Jackson’s words, “to be a strong woman, you don’t have to give up on the things that define you as a woman.” That means respecting, enabling, and indeed celebrating the full range of women’s choices. “Empowering yourself,” Jackson said in her speech at Princeton, “doesn’t have to mean rejecting motherhood, or eliminating the nurturing or feminine aspects of who you are.”\n\nI gave a speech at Vassar last November and arrived in time to wander the campus on a lovely fall afternoon. It is a place infused with a spirit of community and generosity, filled with benches, walkways, public art, and quiet places donated by alumnae seeking to encourage contemplation and connection. Turning the pages of the alumni magazine (Vassar is now coed), I was struck by the entries of older alumnae, who greeted their classmates with Salve (Latin for “hello”) and wrote witty remembrances sprinkled with literary allusions. Theirs was a world in which women wore their learning lightly; their news is mostly of their children’s accomplishments. Many of us look back on that earlier era as a time when it was fine to joke that women went to college to get an “M.R.S.” And many women of my generation abandoned the Seven Sisters as soon as the formerly all-male Ivy League universities became coed. I would never return to the world of segregated sexes and rampant discrimination. But now is the time to revisit the assumption that women must rush to adapt to the “man’s world” that our mothers and mentors warned us about.\n\nI continually push the young women in my classes to speak more. They must gain the confidence to value their own insights and questions, and to present them readily. My husband agrees, but he actually tries to get the young men in his classes to act more like the women—to speak less and listen more. If women are ever to achieve real equality as leaders, then we have to stop accepting male behavior and male choices as the default and the ideal. We must insist on changing social policies and bending career tracks to accommodate our choices, too. We have the power to do it if we decide to, and we have many men standing beside us.\n\nWe’ll create a better society in the process, for all women. We may need to put a woman in the White House before we are able to change the conditions of the women working at Walmart. But when we do, we will stop talking about whether women can have it all. We will properly focus on how we can help all Americans have healthy, happy, productive lives, valuing the people they love as much as the success they seek.",

She is also fascinated by the process of science, the institutions that fund it, and the people who make it happen.\n\nIn the middle of the Caribbean Sea, over 1,000 rhesus macaques live on an island that measures less than a tenth of a mile across. Descendants of a monkey colony imported from India 86 years ago sunbathe, climb trees, and wade in the ocean on Puerto Rico’s Isla de los Monos.\n\nThe island serves as a 38-acre open-air laboratory, with these semi-wild macaques as subjects. The monkeys offer a tantalizing opportunity for scientists hoping to observe animal behavior as close to the wild as they can get, while also having ready access to the monkeys’ brains, bodies, and genes. That often means killing them.\n\nOne morning in 2021, researchers transported a monkey, like thousands before him, to a laboratory at the Caribbean Primate Research Center (CPRC) at the University of Puerto Rico less than 50 miles away. “We watched him die,” former research assistant Alyssa told me in a video call last summer. “And then we did what we always do, which is take him apart.” (Vox has changed her name to protect her from retaliation.) Killing and dissecting monkeys — up to seven per day, she remembers — was part of the lab’s standard protocol.\n\nDuring the culling season in the fall, hundreds of monkeys are killed to control the population of the tiny island. Rather than let their bodies go to waste, Alyssa’s team dissected them, meticulously preserving their muscles, organs, and brains for studies attempting to connect the monkeys’ social lives to their anatomy and genetics.\n\nAlyssa joined the lab in 2021, after graduating college. Before accepting the job, the lab’s principal investigator called her, asking whether she was comfortable with blood. She said yes — she wasn’t squeamish, and had no trouble dissecting frogs and lamb hearts in school. “It didn’t raise any flags for me at all,” she said.\n\nAlyssa’s soon-to-be boss then described perfusion, a euthanasia procedure where, in their lab, a deeply anesthetized monkey is strapped to a table and pumped with saline and preservatives while their blood is pumped out. This preserves the animal’s tissue for study after death. But, Alyssa said, he left out that the researchers would be witnessing living animals die in front of them, “no matter whether it was old, whether it was an infant…” She paused. “We dissected infants.”\n\nEvery day, Alyssa watched at least one monkey die on an operating table, before she would immediately start cutting into it. Her job was to carefully separate all of the organs and tissues and store them in a freezer, preserving them until other scientists could analyze them. She wore a specially fitted mask to avoid breathing in bone dust while sawing through skulls.\n\nHow I reported this From day one of my Future Perfect fellowship — exactly one year after my last day working with monkeys as a PhD student — I knew I wanted to write this story. I was sure I wasn’t alone in my post-animal research angst, but I wanted to find others willing to share their experiences with me. I ended up speaking with nearly a dozen people, these interviews capturing all of my own unspoken feelings: that it’s impossible to explain what one sees in these facilities, but dissociating from it is impossible, too. Over the next several months, I weaved pieces of these conversations together with my reporting on mental health in academia and animal testing regulation. The nuance of this piece was tricky, and my goal throughout was to highlight flaws in the academic system without undermining the value and necessity of the research itself. I worked with a team of editors, fact-checkers, and lawyers to get there. (The first draft of this piece was nearly twice as long as what you’re reading now!)\n\nAs she settled into her new routine, she realized just how difficult her day-to-day life would be to explain to outsiders. “The thing that was so crazy to me,” Alyssa said, “was no one else will know what has happened here.”\n\nShe vented about the monkeys on her daily calls to her boyfriend some 1,600 miles away back home. But he couldn’t handle story after story of relentless, visceral gore, so Alyssa turned to her therapist. After crying over the phone, she waited for the calm reassurance she’d come to expect. Instead, her therapist told Alyssa that she was really worried for her mental health. “I surprised myself with how alone I was feeling,” she remembered.\n\nThe night terrors began when she came back home. Culling season was over, but Alyssa woke up to panic attacks for months. She’d flinch whenever someone approached her from behind at work or surprised her in public. Symptoms piled up for months before a psychiatrist named what she was experiencing: post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nA multimedia artist as well as a scientist, Alyssa started creating art inspired by the necropsies seared into her memory — anything to make the images visible to the outside world. During our video call, she reached out of frame and pulled out a life-sized crochet replica of a macaque’s gastrointestinal system.\n\nIn the necropsy lab, Alyssa cut each monkey’s gastrointestinal tract from rectum to esophagus, picked it up with triple-gloved hands, and weighed it — part of their standard protocol for collecting and preserving tissues after dissection. An adult macaque’s intestines can be over a dozen feet long, and weigh a good deal more than a ball of yarn. To make the plush guts feel as hefty as she remembered, “I put beads inside them,” she said, “so when you lift it up, it would feel like what you would do every day.”\n\n“I made three: a big, a medium, and an infant-sized.” Alyssa said, holding the tiniest replica, a fuzzy marble-filled snake, to the camera. “I was obsessed with describing to other people what we had seen in that place.”\n\nOne of Alyssa’s crochet gastrointestinal tracts, photographed by her.\n\nAlyssa’s experience is anything but rare. Animal research, while largely hidden from public view, is widespread across the life sciences. Animals are used in everything from safety testing for medicines, cosmetics, and pesticides to exploring open-ended questions about how the mind and body work. The drugs we take, the products we use, and the medical breakthroughs we celebrate have been made possible in large part by lab animals and the people who, in the name of science, kill them.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to find the exact number of scientists, veterinarians, and animal caretakers working in research facilities, we know that somewhere around 100 million animals — mice, rats, dogs, cats, rabbits, monkeys, fish, and birds, among others — are used for research and testing worldwide each year. Between 2011 and 2021, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided $2.2 billion in grants for an estimated 4,000 research projects involving animals.\n\nAnimal research is traumatic — obviously for the animals unlucky enough to be involved, but also for many of the humans tasked with harming them. Yet from day one, institutions teach animal researchers that expressing discomfort is akin to weakness, or tantamount to dismissing the value of science altogether. To compete for increasingly rare tenure-track jobs, graduate students and postdocs have no choice but to learn to suppress their emotions and get the work done. Principal investigators, senior scientists who direct animal research labs, often don’t care whether inserting electrodes into a conscious, chronically ill monkey’s brain makes you squeamish. If you can’t handle the heat, they say, get out of the kitchen.\n\n“The costs have always been out there,” bioethicist and former animal researcher John Gluck said. “They’ve just been completely ignored.”\n\nI would know. I spent thousands of hours immersed in the world of researching monkeys (known in the scientific community as NHPs, or nonhuman primates), attempting to study how the brain weighs options during decision-making. In 2023, I graduated from the University of California Berkeley with a PhD in neuroscience, questionable data, zero academic publications, and an intense combination of guilt, rage, and burnout that I’m only just beginning to process.\n\nIt’s not clear exactly how many researchers suffer mental health consequences from their work, and it’s impossible to disentangle the psychological side effects of harming animals from those of trying to survive in an unforgiving, underpaid, and poorly regulated workplace. I do know that many people I know who worked in an animal research facility, myself included, left feeling broken. “Everybody that I know has horror stories,” Alyssa agreed.\n\nIn an emailed statement, CPRC told Vox that it is “deeply committed to supporting our researchers’ mental health and well-being,” and that its researchers are encouraged to seek mental health resources. “As an organization, we remain steadfast in our commitment to upholding the highest ethical, safety, and compliance standards. Our operations align with all applicable federal and institutional guidelines. We actively foster a professional, respectful, and collaborative environment where researchers can openly discuss challenges and seek support,” the statement said.\n\nAcademic institutions have long avoided talking openly about the trauma of animal research. In part, they’re afraid that acknowledging it might invite scrutiny from animal rights activists and undermine the public’s already damaged trust in science. The reality is that it’s easier to downplay the emotional toll of animal testing than to confront the ethical and logistical challenges of dealing with it, given just how central it is to biomedical research.\n\nNow, as the Trump administration wages an unprecedented war on scientific institutions, this might feel like a particularly sensitive time to air uncomfortable conversations about painful aspects of science out in the open. But the scientific community can no longer avoid hard conversations about the psychological costs borne by young scientists. If universities and funding agencies admit that there’s a problem, they can take meaningful steps — like providing better mental health resources and investing in non-animal research methods — to improve conditions for everyone.\n\nBut if young researchers are left to suffer in silence, it is science itself that will suffer, as bright, empathetic minds turn away from some of the most important questions in research — or worse, leave the field altogether.\n\nWhy do we still experiment on animals?\n\nThe practice of experimenting on animals is as old as biological science itself. To understand a machine, you have to take it apart and figure out how the pieces fit together. Living bodies are biological machines — to understand how bodies grow, get sick, and recover, scientists have to take them apart.\n\nIn the earliest days of Western science, dissection of both animals and human cadavers laid the groundwork for modern surgery and medicine. Today, scientists have many more tools at their disposal, enabling them to make specific cells in a mouse’s brain glow under a microscope or to remote-control a living fruit fly. What hasn’t changed is that most of the time, animals are killed when an experiment ends — whether by relatively hands-off methods like gas chambers, or wincingly hands-on methods like snapping their necks, which goes by the more clinical term “cervical dislocation.”\n\nFor all its ethical problems, animal research has yielded medical breakthroughs that we take for granted today. Without lab animals, we wouldn’t have polio vaccines, PrEP (an HIV-prevention medication that slashes sexual transmission risk by 99 percent), or deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease.\n\nBut animals often make poor substitutes for humans. Much of biomedical science ends up stranded in what researchers call the “valley of death”: the huge divide between promising preclinical studies, many of which involve testing on animals, and genuine breakthroughs in human medicine. Over 90 percent of preclinical trials for cancer drugs, for example, don’t translate to successful clinical trials, because treatments that seem to work in mice fail in humans.\n\nComplex socio-psychological conditions like depression are especially challenging to model in caged animals that can’t have natural — much less human-like — experiences. Even monkeys, our close genetic relatives, are stressed and often behave abnormally when caged in a lab, making them poor proxies for uncaged humans.\n\nSome newer tools, like AI models and 3D-printed human tissues, are beginning to replace animals in some studies, But not all animal-based methods have alternatives. AI, for example, has to be trained on real-world data to accurately reflect real-world biology. If that data doesn’t exist yet, scientists need to collect it — usually from the body of a lab animal. And many of medicine’s most urgent, complex problems, like cancer, affect the whole body in ways that are hard to predict without invasively experimenting on a living organism.\n\nNew initiatives like NIH’s Complement Animal Research in Experimentation Program, which has funded the development of new human-based biomedical tools, may encourage some researchers to pivot away from animal testing. But funding agencies in the US and elsewhere are only just beginning to incentivize scientists to develop alternatives.\n\nMeanwhile, funding agencies and research institutions are striving to prove the legitimacy of animal research to the public even as the Trump administration seeks to defund science. Animal researchers know that their work is heavily scrutinized by animal rights activists, who are looking for vulnerabilities to galvanize the public around. Americans are divided on animal research, but the vast majority say it should be phased out in favor of non-animal methods.\n\nOne postdoctoral researcher I spoke with, who works with mice, told me that a lab on her campus lost NIH funding following a PETA campaign, which also drove hate mail and threats against the scientists who worked there. These experiences breed defensiveness and close researchers off from engaging with critics. “Our interactions with [animal rights] groups are often at conferences, with people protesting outside and yelling at you,” she said. “It just propagates that negative interaction.”\n\nSo young animal researchers with misgivings are told to keep quiet. When I was in grad school, senior scientists told me that publicly expressing discomfort — or even sharing day-to-day details of my work — would only enrage animal rights activists and potentially fuel further distrust in science. But this silence comes at a cost, stifling innovation and entrenching outdated methods.\n\n“We’re highly leveraged by the system to keep doing what we’ve always done,” said Garet Lahvis, former graduate program director of behavioral neuroscience at Oregon Health and Science University. (Lahvis previously wrote about experimenting on caged primates for Vox.) Turning against a tried-and-true method would require a scientist to invalidate their existing body of work, or at least acknowledge that it was unethical, ineffective, or inefficient. So, many don’t.\n\nWant to learn more about animal research? Check out “Animal testing, explained.” Here, I walked through what experimenting on animals actually looks like, why scientists do it, and who is looking out for the welfare of the animals. I also spoke with some researchers who are developing new animal-free tools for biomedical research, and discussed what it will take to replace animals entirely.\n\nOver the past few decades, meanwhile, the grant application process has become increasingly competitive, driving scientists to do whatever it takes to make their project proposals sound appealing to potential funders. A 2023 survey of biomedical researchers found that reviewers of grants and peer-reviewed publications generally remain biased in favor of projects with animal-based methods, creating an incentive for scientists to use animals.\n\nLisa Jones-Engel, a former senior scientist at the University of Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) and current senior science adviser at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), recalled serving on the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, an ethics oversight panel responsible for reviewing and approving the university’s animal research proposals. She went line by line through each protocol to find ethical breaches worth addressing, but was constantly shut down by her colleagues, who she suspected were more interested in quickly pushing proposals through the pipeline than protecting animal welfare.\n\n“We encourage responsibility and accountability for ensuring ethical and responsible animal care, science, and human welfare,” WaNPRC told Vox in an email. The university did not comment on Jones-Engel’s experience, but emphasized that researchers are encouraged to report ethical concerns to their principal adviser, department chair, or anonymously, if necessary.\n\n“I spent 17 years at the university, and it nearly killed me,” Jones-Engel told me. “I thought that I could single-handedly bring about change just by laying the science out in front of my scientific colleagues. It turns out that I wasn’t able to do that.”\n\nWhy would anyone sign up for this?\n\nMadeline Krasno grew up loving animals, and hoped to follow in Jane Goodall’s footsteps as a primatologist. In 2011, the then-20-year-old applied to be a student caretaker at the Harlow Primate Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There, she and one other undergraduate were responsible for weekend feeding, medication, and cleaning the rooms of over 500 monkeys. She believed what she was told: Those monkeys were contributing to important biomedical studies, helping scientists make necessary public health breakthroughs. At least, she recalled, “That’s what you tell yourself to make this okay.”\n\nTo boost their chances of getting into competitive graduate programs, many undergrads and recent college graduates eagerly accept entry-level, relatively low-paid jobs like these.\n\nDay one at a primate research center in the US can shock even the most hardened scientist. As a neuroscience PhD student, I spent a lot of time in my lab’s monkey housing room, which always smelled like stale urine and honey. Netflix shows played for a few hours a day on a wall-mounted TV as veterinarian-approved “enrichment” for the animals, who lived in pairs in metal cages smaller than my full-size bed.\n\nA laboratory monkey interacting with an employee at the National Primate Research Center of Thailand. AFP via Getty Images\n\nSome research groups, like mine, introduce new trainees to these spaces right away to gauge whether they have the stomach for it. Others don’t expose trainees to the most disturbing aspects of their work until they’ve proven themselves trustworthy.\n\nFormer research assistant Mayo Asada wasn’t invited into her neurobiology lab’s back rooms, where surgeries take place, for the first month that she worked at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis (CNPRC) in 2021. The first time Asada saw her lab’s monkeys, it was necropsy day. She watched a handler bring a young male monkey into a sterile examination room, “holding his hand to keep him calm.” The monkey was anesthetized and pumped with saline, like the monkeys in Alyssa’s lab. As blood left the unconscious monkey, Asada watched as people began removing parts of his body. “We know that you weren’t expecting to see this,” Asada was told.\n\n“I wasn’t sure if he was conscious, or how aware he was of what was happening,” Asada remembers, referring to the monkey. “I was hoping by then that he was in an altered state.” Asada paused. “I honestly don’t remember the rest. I just remember the pieces being separated onto different tables.”\n\nDespite her shock and discomfort, Asada stuck around. Biomedical careers, especially in academia, often hinge on your superiors’ opinions. If your well-connected adviser likes you, their glowing letter of recommendation can open doors to prestigious jobs. If they don’t, those doors slam shut. The vibe she remembered from superiors in her lab, Asada said, was: “Don’t mess with us. We will ruin your career.”\n\nUC Davis told Vox in a statement that it offers free mental health counseling services to employees and students, and that “harassment, discrimination, bullying, and other abusive conduct violates university policy. Anyone experiencing or witnessing such conduct is encouraged to report it: we take such reports very seriously and reports are investigated and addressed according to applicable policies and procedures.”\n\nMany early-career researchers believe that the knowledge they gain from their experiments will justify the harm they will cause. After all, breakthrough treatments like gene therapy and organ transplantation were refined in lab animals before humans. I spent years convincing myself that by recording the brain activity of monkeys, I could uncover crucial information about mental health that would someday revolutionize how we treat depression. Eventually, the emotional labor of justifying the work outweighed my belief in its purpose.\n\nMonkey research makes up a small share of all animal research — but working with much more widely used rodent species can still be harrowing, if to a lesser degree than for scientists experimenting on our primate cousins. On the subreddit r/labrats, an anonymous forum for over 650,000 biologists, many posts feature variations on the same existential crisis: reckoning with the intense pressure to harm animals, whether for the sake of public health or professional advancement.\n\nOne recent post asked how people “get past the initial ick” of killing mice. Many users replied, quite simply, that you don’t. In the comments, researchers describe a wide range of coping mechanisms: Sing to the animals. Thank each mouse before putting them in the carbon dioxide chamber. Practice until you can perform injections as painlessly as possible. Or, one user wrote, “just do it until you’re numb to it.”\n\nWhile hosing down cages, Krasno blasted Adele’s then-new album 21 through noise-canceling headphones to drown out the screeching monkeys around her. Now, she can’t listen to “Rolling in the Deep” without being transported back to those rooms, and the guilt she felt in her complacency. “I’m just trying to do what I can for them,” she remembered, “but also to, like, get the fuck out.”\n\nIn an email statement, UW-Madison shared that it offers confidential counseling and crisis support to students and employees, and leads workshops on identifying and responding to stress related to caring for people and animals.\n\nHow academia creates a culture of silence\n\nAs an animal researcher, my life was dictated by animal care.\n\nSeveral times a week, I performed a standard procedure to keep the window into each monkey’s brain — a small hole cut through their skull — open and infection-free. While listening to an episode of This American Life or All Songs Considered, I’d fix a monkey’s head in place, lift a plastic covering off his exposed skull opening, and gently swab and suction new wisps of tissue growth from the leathery membrane covering his brain.\n\nPicture a gloved dental hygienist, sticking a metal pick and a suction doodad in your mouth, casually chitchatting while you’re stuck staring at the ceiling. Over time, I learned to dissociate enough to pretend I was just one of those hygienists.\n\nBut intentionally separating your mind and body is exhausting work. After five years of drowning out screeches and whirring medical tools with podcasts and noise-canceling headphones, I couldn’t feel anything anymore. I spent those years lying about my job on dates, omitting details from my closest friends, and filtering myself in calls with my therapist. At first, I told myself that they wouldn’t understand. Eventually, as my experiments failed over and over, it stopped making sense to me, too.\n\n“We are the mad scientists. We are like the people in horror films, torturing them. It’s crazy what we do to handle it.”\n\nAlmost every researcher I spoke with had a similar experience. Andrew — a former graduate student, whose name has been changed to protect him from harassment — left his position at a major US primate research center in 2022, after spending two years studying infectious diseases in juvenile monkeys. A long-time animal lover, he was initially horrified by the deaths and dissections required to investigate the effects of viral infections on developing brains and bodies. To get through his master’s degree, he dissociated.\n\n“We are the mad scientists. We are like the people in horror films, torturing them. It’s crazy what we do to handle it,” he told me last summer. In the end, the forced apathy crushed what enthusiasm he once had for academic research. “It felt like I was chewed up and spit out.”\n\nFor some researchers, the numbness, anxiety, and distress linger long after the work is done. At CNPRC, Asada turned to alcohol to self-medicate. “I don’t like drinking, but I would drink myself to sleep every night,” she said. “What prompted me to leave was realizing that no one that worked there was okay.” (UC Davis, in a statement, said students can access support through Student Health and Counseling Services, and employees through the Academic and Staff Assistance Program.)\n\nAcademic science has a well-documented mental health problem. A 2018 survey of about 2,300 early-career science researchers across 26 countries reported that 41 percent had moderate to severe anxiety, and 39 percent had moderate to severe depression — often correlated with reports of poor work-life balance and bad relationships with advisers. One study of about 200 Korean scientists found that animal researchers had significantly higher anxiety scores than non-animal researchers.\n\nNor does it help that the scientific enterprise runs a bit like a feudal system, with powerful professors at the top, and postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research assistants at the bottom. The only real way to advance is through having a well-connected mentor at a prestigious, highly-resourced university. But that means anything that might alienate that senior scientist — like questioning the lab’s animal care protocols or experimental techniques — could place your job or even your scientific future at risk.\n\n“So much of science relies on senior research leaders, who don’t have to get their hands dirty anymore, convincing their junior colleagues they have no other options than to do work so violent and disturbing that it makes many of them suicidal,” a pseudonymous X account, run by a graduate student in the sciences who works with non-animal models, posted last August.\n\nThe limits of “compassion fatigue”\n\nWhat limited peer-reviewed research has been done on the mental health effects of lab animal care — usually surveys of veterinarians and animal care technicians — focuses on the concept of “compassion fatigue,” a form of burnout brought on by providing care in exhausting, traumatic environments. Institutions know that early-career scientists struggling with their mental health, even brilliant ones, are likely to leave academia. Academic departments with doctoral training programs also know that losing students looks bad on grant applications, leading reviewers to question their stability and leadership.\n\nSome universities are trying to respond to the crisis. Dare 2 Care, a program at the University of Washington, aims to remedy compassion fatigue by suggesting that workers do things like connect with peers, place heart-shaped stickers indicating planned euthanasia dates on mouse cages, and express gratitude to lab animals for their sacrifice. Giving workers the chance to emotionally prepare for the end of a study — when animals like mice are usually killed — “fosters a sense of closure and reduces emotional distress,” WaNPRC told Vox in an email.\n\nBut “these animals are not choosing to be sacrificed,” said Krasno. Compassion fatigue training, she suspects, is more of a Band-Aid than a solution, with the primary goal of boosting staff retention by reframing an employee’s unease as a personal issue to be managed, rather than an inevitable consequence of their work.\n\n\n\nCompassion fatigue is a common experience for lab veterinarians and animal care technicians — the workers who are tasked with day-to-day maintenance work, like cleaning cages, prepping food, and physically examining lab animals. But one study reported that over three-quarters of animal care workers surveyed felt that institutional compassion fatigue programs didn’t help them manage their symptoms. WaNPRC pointed me to another report, which found that only 24 percent of surveyed animal care workers said compassion fatigue support programming helped improve their symptoms.\n\nWhat institutions ask of tech staff “is hurting these people,” said Jones-Engel, who worked with lab primates for 17 years before becoming a scientist at PETA. “They’re the ones that have to look in the eyes of the monkeys every day. They have to pull that mouse box out and see there were three cannibalized pups in there.”\n\nCompared to care staff, none of the young scientists — grad students, postdocs, and research assistants — I spoke with felt that compassion fatigue was the best way to characterize their experience. It’s a subtle but crucial difference: While care workers face burnout from tending to unhappy animals in bleak spaces, researchers have to view the animals as tools to be used — and the researchers are the ones using them.\n\nResearchers are worn down by the pressure to treat animals as data points. A sick or uncooperative animal can derail months of work, jeopardizing their ability to graduate, publish papers, or compete for scarce academic jobs. Killing living things that you’ve intentionally distanced yourself from — while convincing yourself that it serves some greater utilitarian purpose — is part of the job.\n\n“And then you’re just supposed to go home and eat dinner and exist in your life, and not feel the impact of repeatedly taking someone’s life,” said Krasno. “It’s a highly traumatic field, but somehow, animal researchers get forgotten.”\n\nHow do we fix this?\n\nHowever entrenched animal research feels right now, the world of biomedical research is on the brink of massive change. Within decades, invasive research on lab animals could be obsolete, as new technology allows scientists to test cancer treatments on tissues grown from a patient’s own cells, or create detailed maps of Alzheimer’s disease in human brains.\n\n“Everyone recognizes that the goal is to eventually try to replace animals,” Naomi Charalambakis, the then-associate director of science policy at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, the largest biomedical coalition in the US, told Scientific American last year.\n\nThe financial incentive to replace animal testing, too, is clear and compelling. Like keeping humans alive in prison, keeping animals alive in labs is incredibly expensive. Lab monkeys, which are in short supply, are especially costly, now selling for tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\nAt this point, Jones-Engel believes it’s all but inevitable that animal testing will be phased out. It’s just a matter of when.\n\n“It’s not just that the writing’s on the wall,” she said. “The writing is like, plastered. It’s a giant neon sign saying ‘We’re done.’”\n\nBut the push to phase out animal testing depends on more than just greater efficiency — it calls for a reckoning with a legacy of harm. For the scientific community to truly evolve, it will need to confront its history and acknowledge the possibility of change. Helping animal researchers understand and grapple with their own experiences is a crucial first step.\n\nIt may be tempting to dismiss people who experiment on animals as villains who don’t deserve empathy or institutional support. Considering the well-being of those who cause harm for a living might feel incongruous, like imagining a peer support group for executioners. But new animal researchers often don’t know what they’re getting themselves into, and sometimes even choose to work in these labs because they love animals.\n\nMany institutions know this, so they require first-year grad students to complete several lab rotations, or trial runs where trainees typically spend two to three months in a handful of research groups, before committing to the team they’ll work with for the next few years. But not all programs offer such rotations, including programs where students could end up working with animals. They should.\n\nIt is also crucial that institutions have trustworthy systems in place for reporting workplace safety and animal welfare violations without fear of punishment, and with the option of anonymity.\n\nAnd lab workers also need to have faith that when they report violations, their campus’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), an internal body that oversees each university’s animal research, will take them seriously. Right now, though, these panels are strongly biased toward approving animal experiments. To signal a genuine commitment to animal welfare, institutions should rebalance IACUCs to include a greater percentage of members who aren’t affiliated with the university’s scientific research.\n\nAt bare minimum, institutions need to acknowledge the trauma they expose workers to and provide adequate mental health care for researchers. Simple measures like furnishing warm, naturally lit spaces for personal time and conversation during breaks — and protecting that break time — can make room for vulnerability in an otherwise sterile environment.\n\nUniversity counselors should be trained to help animal researchers navigate complex feelings of guilt, grief, and anxiety, without pressure to reconcile those feelings with any particular ethical stance. In parallel, senior scientists — many of whom were hired for their science chops, not their empathetic leadership — should be taught compassionate mentorship, and how to respond to challenging situations with empathy and tact. Principal investigators “don’t get enough training as it is on how to mentor and train others,” said Jocelyn Breton, a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University and soon-to-be neuroscience professor at Smith College.\n\nBreton has mentored many first-time animal researchers in the decade since she started working with mice and rats. “It’s really hard,” she tells her students, “and it doesn’t get easier.” Her current lab has a dedicated meeting every semester to discuss animal ethics and hold space for people to bring up concerns, and she checks in with her trainees frequently. Before exposing new students to animal death, she briefs them on what to expect. Afterward, she checks in, shares her own emotional experience, and gives students the freedom to set their own boundaries. Students have passed out watching perfusions, she told me, and some trainees quit. Creating a space where trainees feel comfortable choosing to leave is the point.\n\n“You have to strive to have an ethical identity”\n\nJohn Gluck, a research professor at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University who built his career on animal research, credits this kind of openness to dialogue with changing his mind about the use of animals in science. As a graduate student in the 1960s, before animal welfare laws were established in the US, he worked in psychologist Harry Harlow’s infamous monkey lab at UW Madison, where Madeline Krasno cleaned cages decades later. Gluck remembers researchers performing brain surgery with their bare hands and relatively limited experience. Animal welfare was an afterthought.\n\nSo, you’re feeling weird about animal research? After our video call, John Gluck emailed me a list of suggestions for other academics, particularly principal investigators of animal research labs, who are ready to start exploring their ambivalence about animal testing. Here are his suggestions, edited for length: Keep a private journal of moments when questions concerning the validity of animal testing emerge.\n\nSit in on relevant philosophy and ethics talks.\n\nIf you have not yet served on an IACUC, consider getting an appointment. Remain mostly quiet as you take in the process, and consider: Is it a process that screens questionable science, and protects experimental animals from misuse?\n\nMake time to meet with students and caregivers working with the animals in your studies. Have open conversations about their concerns, and reflect on your own comfort and openness during these conversations.\n\nEngage individuals from animal welfare groups and listen to their point of view.\n\nFreely observe the animals associated with your research, with no particular focus.\n\nLearn about the natural behavior of animals commonly used in your research.\n\nWith Harlow’s help, Gluck landed a tenure-track faculty job at the University of New Mexico, where he launched a monkey lab in Harlow’s image — exactly as he was expected to. In 1977, two years after philosopher Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation was published, his lab was attacked by animal rights activists, who released all of the monkeys living there. Gluck was incensed.\n\n“For years, my fury blocked the self-reflection that is expected of any scientist who harms vulnerable animals for presumed human benefit,” Gluck wrote in a 2011 letter to the scientific journal Nature. “I dismissed even reasonable ethical questions directed at me and my work.”\n\nBut over time, Gluck told me, conversations with students and veterinarians slowly opened his mind. Gluck took leave from his faculty job to immerse himself in a bioethics fellowship that ultimately convinced him to leave animal research behind. “What can I say? You just can’t keep publishing mistakes,” he said.\n\nScientists, including a younger Gluck, often dismiss animal welfare activists. He remembers one major scientist responding to protests by saying, “I’d have them all put in a psychiatric facility.” In conversations I’ve had with supporters of animal research, I’ve sensed a similar disdain, even fear, toward people working for organizations like PETA.\n\nBut Gluck says that animal researchers need to give them more credit, or at least actually talk to them: “We’re not listening.”\n\nI asked him what advice he would give to other scientists considering shifting their research model. “You have to strive to have an ethical identity,” he said. “Otherwise, what are you doing? You might as well be working in a bowling alley.”\n\nNot every scientist will, or needs to, make the same radical shift as Gluck did. But there is power in openness, and in loosening one’s grip on the way things have always been. And soon, scientists may be forced to confront the consequences of both the status quo and the sudden upheaval of their institutions by the Trump administration.\n\nThe future of biomedical research will depend on rebuilding and sustaining a thoughtful, empathetic workforce — and on our ability to ensure that discovery doesn’t come at the expense of those who make it possible.",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

        "content": "is an essayist based in Boston, Massachusetts. Her work has appeared in Billboard, Boston magazine, Philadelphia magazine, and Boston Globe magazine, and she publishes a biweekly newsletter with Melinda Fakuade called This Is Why!\n\nThis story was originally published in The Highlight, Vox’s member-exclusive magazine. To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today.\n\nWinter is unavoidable — and for many, the winter blues feel that way, too.\n\nIf the thought of shorter, colder days fills you with dread, you’re not alone. According to the Cleveland Clinic, at least 5 percent of American adults experience seasonal affective disorder, or “SAD” — a type of major depressive disorder related to seasonal changes — and another 10 to 20 percent feel a “milder form of the winter blues.”\n\n“Living in New England, where winters are long and the days are short, I often notice a shift in my clients’ mood and energy levels during this time,” Christie Lebrun, a therapist based in Boston, said in an email. “Many report feeling more fatigued, which leads them to stay indoors more often. The lack of sunlight and the colder temperatures contribute to this, making it harder for them to engage with their communities or pursue social activities outside of work.”\n\nEven though experiencing a declining mood during winter is quite common, it doesn’t mean we need to lean into those feelings. Instead of fixating on what winter doesn’t offer (like long, sunny days), focusing on what’s unique and special about the season can help you break out of the winter doldrums, according to both seasonal experts and winter lovers. If you’re in need of some inspiration, consider the following tips.\n\nTravel to an even colder city, and take notes\n\nIf you’re a lifelong hater of winter, you may just need to take a trip to somewhere even chillier. Yes, you read that right.\n\n“Traveling somewhere cold and snowy like a winter city can be really eye-opening,” says Kari Leibowitz, psychologist and author of How to Winter, a book based on her research on inhabitants of extreme climates and her personal experiences living about 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Tromsø, Norway. “Places with more extreme winters … almost have no choice but to adapt [and] to figure out how to embrace the season. It’s actually the places at more middle latitudes that struggle more and that need to learn from these places.”\n\nIn the case of, say, New Yorkers or Londoners, Leibowitz says, they are “not forced to adapt in the same way” and rely on a strategy of “avoidance in a way that is totally counterproductive.”\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

In Magog, you’ll find commuters skating down a nearly 2-mile-long ice trail to get through town, stopping at a cafe along the way for a warm beverage. There is also a Nordic spa just outside of downtown, where you’ll see dozens of people dunking their heads in a cold plunge fed by a frozen river, then walking along a snow-surrounded outdoor path to a sauna.\n\n“A lot of people think they want to retire to the South,” he says. “I would want to retire in Alaska.”\n\nMagog is known as a “winter city,” a term that describes a place that plans its infrastructure, transportation, and recreational opportunities around encouraging public life in the winter. There are winter cities all over the world: In the US, you’ll find winter wonderlands in Lake Placid, New York; Leavenworth, Washington; and Woodstock, Vermont, to name a few.\n\nSasha Pedro, a photographer and winter fanatic based in Massachusetts, traveled as far as Iceland this winter season to make her snowy dreams come true. Her love of the colder months may be genetic, she thinks, given that both of her parents are from Boston. “My parents always talked about if they retired and moved … they would go to Maine or Canada,” she says. “We’re all interested in just getting colder. … You could convince me to go to Iceland in a heartbeat, but a beach resort vacation would take a little bit of [talking into].”\n\nFellow winter-lover Doug Macias, an attorney based in Long Island, New York, agrees: “A lot of people think they want to retire to the South,” he says. “I would want to retire in Alaska.”\n\nGo outside and get some exercise\n\nIf travel isn’t in the budget, picking up a winter hobby that you can look forward to each year, especially one that you can do outside, is another way to take the edge off of the season.\n\n“People all over the world who do winter well, they find a way to get outside even when it is cold and wet and dark,” says Leibowitz.\n\nOne of the reasons Pedro loves winter is because of fond memories spent ice skating outside with family as a child, especially on her birthday in January. “My dad was a recreational hockey player, so I grew up on skates,” she says. “A lot of my birthdays were spent ice skating. There’s nothing better in my opinion.”\n\n“When someone is feeling down during the winter, I recommend making it a priority to get outside for some sunlight, even if it’s just for a short walk.”\n\nMacias also has a nostalgic tie to winter days spent outside. In addition to ice skating, he’s found joy in the less glamorous activity of snow shoveling. “I really like snow days,” he says. “They were my favorite as a kid. … Me and my brothers would shovel for a few hours, and usually do our whole block — and then [have] snowball fights.”\n\nIce skating outside isn’t always feasible or safe, but even a public indoor rink will do the trick. If you’re not feeling confident about your balance on skates, then opt for a walk through your neighborhood.\n\n“When someone is feeling down during the winter, I recommend making it a priority to get outside for some sunlight, even if it’s just for a short walk,” Lebrun says. “A 10- to 30-minute walk can make a noticeable difference.”\n\nTurn to the tenets of hygge at home\n\nHygge (pronounced “hoo-gah”) is a word to describe a Danish tenet of happiness, all about embracing coziness, slow living, and special moments with family and friends. In the mid-2010s, it became a viral trend in the US. The concept can be especially helpful for bringing some much-needed appreciation to dark and long winter nights.\n\nPedro says her childhood home was designed by her mother according to hygge. She grew up around lots of warm colors, mugs, and cozy blankets. She mirrors this in her own home, where she lives with her partner. “Rather than a clean, tidy home, we have a lot of musical instruments. We have a lot of photos of loved ones on my wall. My main view across from the couch is 80 percent artwork associated with my dog,” she says. “Everywhere I look, something in my home makes me happy, and so it’s a nice place to be.”\n\nA full home redesign isn’t necessary, but take some inspiration from Pedro and make sure that home is a happy place for you. That way, spending a little more time indoors doesn’t have to be a reason to get the winter blues. Hygge for your household can be as easy as lighting more candles indoors, one of Leibowitz’s favorite winter habits.\n\nSpend more time with (winter-loving) friends and family\n\nThe truth is that winter is only as one-note as you make it. If you allow the weather to limit your schedule, then you’ll miss out on the fun times that winter does have to offer. Winter “is no more monotonous than any other season,” Macias says. “Winter gets too much flack.”\n\nLeibowitz agrees: “If you talk to somebody who skis or snowboards or a sauna enthusiast, they all look forward to winter because they have special things that they do during the season.”\n\nWhen Pedro’s partner, originally from Phoenix, moved in with her, he was not well-versed in winter. Over the years, she’s taken him winter hiking in their area, ice skating outdoors on a trip to Chicago, and on brisk walks with her snow-loving dog, a Chow and Shiba Inu mix built for the winter. Now, they look forward to winter every year. “You just have to prepare yourself and have things to do,” Pedro said.\n\nLebrun agrees that the best antidote to winter boredom is planning opportunities to socialize, whether indoors or outdoors. She suggests scheduling social activities often, whether it’s a movie night, dinner, or even a virtual hang out or phone call, to lift your mood.",

        "content": "is a senior technology correspondent at Vox. He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like Gizmodo, Vice, and the Atlantic.\n\nFor a decade, my wife’s read receipts have been on without her knowing it. She kept checking her phone’s settings to see if they were turned off, and they were. But every time I sent her a text, I’d see that my message got delivered, and what time she read it. Suffice it to say, this led to some frustration.\n\nRead receipts are a sore spot for a lot of couples, friends, family members, employers — really anyone who sends and receives text messages these days. It wasn’t always like this. Just a few years ago, you could send a text and not expect the unwelcome and day-ruining reminder that the recipient had read but failed to respond to your message.\n\nBut these days, bad manners isn’t the only reason why read receipts are bad. They can be an invitation for scammers to target you. And while you can turn them off on iOS and Android’s default messaging apps, you might even consider using an entirely different app for your day-to-day texting needs that allow you even more privacy protections.\n\nVox Technology Dispatches from senior correspondent Adam Clark Estes about how technology is changing the world — and how it’s changing us. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nSeriously, though, stop using read receipts — on any of your messaging apps. Turn them off. There is little upside to giving away this tiny clue about how you’re spending your time and attention. There is plenty of upside to reverting to a more primitive form of communication where you send a text and have no idea what happens to it next. You might even find solace in not knowing if the message was read. Maybe it just got lost in cyberspace, and maybe you should move on with your day rather than fretting.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that this is how texting worked. The first text message was sent using SMS, or short message service, technology in 1992 — it said “Merry Christmas.” Ten years later, we got MMS, or multimedia messaging service, which worked like SMS but with images, video, and audio files.\n\nJust a few years ago, you could send a text and not expect the unwelcome and day-ruining reminder that the recipient had read but failed to respond to your message.\n\nAlthough a similar feature existed on email, BlackBerry gets credit for the first read receipt on a text message in its BBM instant messaging service, which launched in 2005. At the time, you could not turn off read receipts there, and people quickly realized that it could be bad if their friends knew they’d read a message but had not replied. So BlackBerry forums filled up with tips and tricks to avoid this.\n\nApple made the feature mainstream when it launched iMessage in 2011. It complicated the situation four years later, when it added the ability to send read receipts to certain people but not others. Rich communication services, or RCS, is a messaging protocol that started gaining widespread adoption in the years after iMessage launched, and it brought read receipts to most Android devices.\n\nSo what is a read receipt? It’s actually just a bit of metadata, or bits of information that describe other bits of information. In this case, that includes details about the text message, including the fact that it was opened and at what time. So when someone opens a message, that metadata bounces back to the original sender, who’s notified that their message was read. There are also delivery receipts that tell the sender only that the message has reached the recipient (but not that it’s been read). These are common features in both default messaging apps as well as dedicated messaging platforms, like WhatsApp, Signal, and so on. Unfortunately, you can’t turn off delivery receipts like read receipts — which, once again, you should.\n\nRelated How to fight back in the war against spam texts\n\nYou could argue that read receipts are good. And in some situations, I’d agree with that. Parents texting teens, a boss texting an employee, a husband texting a spouse — I can see how there’s value in just knowing a message was seen and it doesn’t create any awkwardness. In other social settings, however, it just creates dissonance.\n\n“We’re getting information that implies a response is forthcoming, and when one isn’t, we feel slighted — which only makes sense, because the receipt made it possible to even know.” Jeffrey A. Hall, a communications studies professor at the University of Kansas, told me. “It plays with our expectations.”\n\nPut differently, a read receipt gets you excited about hearing back from a friend, and when you don’t, you’re understandably annoyed.\n\nIf you’ve ever received a spam text and opened it, for instance, the bad actor on the other end of the exchange knows that you’re a person.\n\nThere’s a darker, more technical side to this. Because read receipts are lines of code that get exchanged between the sender and the recipient of the message, it can be exploited by hackers and scammers. If you’ve ever received a spam text and opened it, for instance, the bad actor on the other end of the exchange knows that you’re a person and will likely target you with more spam texts.\n\nIt gets worse. In a preprint paper from 2024, researchers from the University of Vienna described a worst-case scenario in which read receipts and delivery receipts — which, again, cannot be turned off — reveal private information about you and your device without your knowledge or consent.\n\n“Potentially, you’ve even used these features yourself in a more harmless way and without any bad intentions, e.g., when your partner is on their way home in an unsafe neighborhood and you know they’re low on battery you could ping them with an arbitrary message and wait for successful delivery to see whether their phone is still on,” Gabriel K. Gegenhuber, one of the paper’s authors, wrote to me in an email. “Also, when you message somebody that is on a flight, you would later be notified about the exact time they’ve landed.”\n\nThis approach even works in encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Signal. Things could get even worse if the details of your receipts ended up in the wrong hands.\n\n“Both delivery and read receipts could be abused by people that are actually close to you,” Gegenhuber said. “Due to the information they leak, they could be used for stalking and intimate partner abuse.”\n\nTurning off read receipts is an easy way to avoid both social faux pas and being targeted by scammers and other bad actors. Apple has good guides for turning them off on iPhones, iPads, and Macs, which include instructions for turning them off system-wide as well as for specific people. Google offers one switch to turn them off on Android devices, and here’s a guide for that. Then it varies by app. Here are some helpful links for WhatsApp and Signal.\n\nYou might also consider just ditching the default messaging app on your phone altogether and using one of those third-party apps. Signal, in particular, is an app I like. It’s end-to-end encrypted, private by default, run by a nonprofit, and free. You can also expect to avoid spam on it.\n\nWhen someone on Signal receives a message from someone for the first time, they encounter what we call a “message request” screen,” Jun Harada, vice president of partnerships and growth at Signal, told me. That way you can see what’s in the message without being able to accidentally click a link or open a file, and “without worrying about what information they might be sending back to the sender,” Harada says.\n\nIn the process of reporting this story, I did manage to figure out why my wife kept getting read receipts for me and me alone. She’d somehow turned them off for everyone else, but I was the last holdout. Now my read receipt privilege has been revoked — but you know, I’m fine with that.",

Today I’m covering another purge at the Justice Department, where Donald Trump’s administration is taking revenge against high-ranking career prosecutors who prosecuted Trump allies over January 6 and in other criminal cases.\n\nWhat’s the latest? The head of the Washington, DC, US attorney’s office demoted seven high-ranking prosecutors on Friday, Reuters reports, moving them to entry-level positions in a bid to force them to quit. Those demoted include:\n\nThe leader of the “ Capitol siege prosecution unit\n\nA prosecutor who worked on criminal cases against Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro\n\nProsecutors who worked on criminal cases against the heads of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two far-right extremist groups that worked to steal the 2020 election on Trump’s behalf\n\nThe experienced attorneys will now mostly handle misdemeanors and low-level crimes. The demotions follow the January firing of US attorneys who prosecuted Trump over his attempt to steal the 2020 election.\n\nWhy were they demoted? Ed Martin, the Trump-appointed new head of the DC office, claimed the moves reflected a shift in priorities and a focus on local crime in DC. But the Trump-related experiences of the officials selected — and the move of experienced prosecutors to entry-level jobs — make it difficult to believe this wasn’t an act of retribution.\n\nThe Logoff The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

The demotions send a strong signal to prosecutors that there will be consequences for officials who try to hold Trump and his allies accountable to the law. It’s also another blow against the DOJ’s independence, as Trump works to remake law enforcement as a tool he can wield for political ends. And the move weakens the US attorney’s office in Washington, which is tasked with prosecuting abuses of power by some of the country’s most powerful people.\n\nAnd with that, it’s time to log off…",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "writes about pop culture, media, and ethics. Before joining Vox in 2016, they were a staff reporter at the Daily Dot. A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they’re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.\n\nThere’s one group you won’t find joining in the push to redeem alleged child-killer Casey Anthony, following her attempted image rehabilitation in the 2020s: the true crime fan community. As of March 2025, Anthony has joined TikTok in her capacity as a “legal advocate,” and the backlash is strong.\n\nThat’s because despite Casey Anthony being found not guilty in 2011 of allegedly murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, conventional wisdom holds that she almost certainly was involved in Caylee’s disappearance and death. While the case against her unfolded as an avaricious media circus that portrayed Casey as a callous Orlando party girl, the actual evidence against her makes a strong argument that, in Casey Anthony’s case, the media got it right.\n\nCasey Anthony did party while Caylee was missing. For 31 days in 2008, she behaved like any other 22-year-old without a care in the world — without telling a single human being that her daughter had vanished. That’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nCasey Anthony’s guilt is essentially settled fact among true crime fans. Her acquittal — and the truly wild case that led up to it, from petty theft and “hot bod” contests to “Zanny the Nanny” — has become firmly fixed in pop culture as an egregious example of the justice system failing.\n\nAt least, it was until Casey’s attempt to wrest control of the narrative. This began in 2022, with Casey Anthony: Where the Truth Lies, a three-part limited series (we’re loath to call it a documentary) released to Peacock, in which Casey blamed her daughter’s murder on her own father, George Anthony, expanding on claims of abuse she made at trial. These are unsubstantiated claims which he has consistently denied.\n\nIn her new TikTok video, Anthony tells viewers she has been a “legal advocate” since 2011, and that it’s time “I start to advocate for myself…and for my daughter.” She also directs viewers to her new Substack, where she says they can start conversations with her. (Comments on her TikTok are currently off.) It’s unclear how Anthony intends to carry out legal advocacy work, though her recent Substack posts mention the importance of presumed innocence and not rushing to judgment. She also wishes to discuss the importance of safeguarding her privacy, though it’s unclear how elevating her public profile will do that.\n\nCasey’s behavior, then and now, makes a compelling argument that not every public scandal needs to be relitigated, nor does every headline-grabbing criminal case need to be perpetually thrust again and again into the public eye. Unfortunately, the death of Caylee Anthony is just one of several high-profile true crime cases that have recently been dragged once again into the spotlight, despite being previously considered resolved.\n\nAnd while some of those cases scream injustice and beg for renewed attention, others — like this one — seem to be less about truth-seeking and more about finding new ways to profit and exploit the popularity of older true crime cases.\n\nCasey Anthony’s behavior was infamously bizarre\n\nCasey Anthony is a proven liar. Her narrative of her own story is untrustworthy. She was found guilty at trial of providing false information to law enforcement.\n\nCasey had a long pattern of lying, beginning with years of constructing elaborate lies about her progress through high school, and later about her nonexistent job and even her pregnancy with Caylee — a backstory she shares with multiple convicted killers who all eventually murdered members of their family. Rather unusually, however, Casey’s parents, according to her brother Lee’s testimony at her trial, had a history of enabling and playing along with their daughter’s lies rather than holding her to account for them.\n\nBy 2008, per contemporaneous media reports as well as court documents, 22-year-old Casey was still living on and off with her parents, George and Cindy, in Orlando, while habitually engaging in petty theft from her family and friends. She sought to convince everyone that she had spent the past several years working as an event coordinator for Universal Studios.\n\nIn the days after June 16, 2008, 2-year-old Caylee went missing. For the next 31 days, Casey, who was staying with her boyfriend at the time, told no one about her daughter’s disappearance. Instead, she gave conflicting statements about where she was — sometimes saying she was staying with a friend, other times claiming she was staying with a nanny — and took no action to locate her. In early July, she got a back tattoo reading “bella vita,” or “beautiful life.” Multiple friends would later testify at trial that, during that month, Casey seemed “upbeat,” “normal,” and “happy.”\n\n“Oh, my god, I am such a good liar,” one witness recalled Casey laughing.\n\nDuring this month, Casey had been refusing to communicate with her parents, and most concerningly refusing to give them a straight answer about where Caylee was. On July 15, 2008, she finally returned home — and on that day, her parents placed a series of 911 calls. The first was an attempt to report the family car Casey had taken and abandoned as missing, hopeful leverage to get her to tell them where Caylee was; the last came after they’d gotten their answer: Casey told her parents that Caylee’s nanny had stolen the little girl and that Casey had been trying unsuccessfully to locate her daughter, on her own, for the past month. Hearing this, a frantic and audibly panicked Cindy Anthony placed the now infamous call to the police.\n\nThis call jump-started the investigation into one of the most infamous modern true crime cases — infamous both because of Casey Anthony’s bizarre behavior and because no one knows, still, what happened to Caylee Anthony.\n\nThe case of Caylee Anthony began with elaborate, outrageous lies, and then kept going\n\nFrom the time of her mother’s 911 call until her trial three years later — when her story changed completely — Casey insisted to police and everyone else that Caylee had been abducted.\n\nCasey claimed she knew who had Caylee: A woman named “Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez” who’d been Caylee’s nanny for the last two years. She had met “Zanny the Nanny,” she told police, through a co-worker of hers at Universal Studios; Zanny had once been his child’s nanny as well. But Casey didn’t work at Universal. Not only that, the male colleague she named hadn’t worked for Universal in six years, had never heard of a nanny named Zanny, and didn’t even have kids.\n\nAs for Zanny herself? She didn’t exist. When the police managed to track down a Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez on the other side of Orlando, she had no idea who the Anthonys were. But Casey was so committed to this lie that she confidently took investigators to Universal Studios headquarters, got staff to buzz her in, and led them around the office building while she looked for, apparently, a convincing open room that she could try to claim as her office. When she failed to find one, she abruptly gave up in mid-stride, turned around, and confessed to lying about working there. She continued to insist, however, that Zanny the Nanny was real.\n\nWhat we do know is that Caylee most likely died by homicide. In August 2008, an eagle-eyed meter reader named Roy Kronk spotted and reported what he believed could be human remains in a wooded area; Caylee was finally located and identified there in December 2008. While no cause of death could be determined due to the extent of decomposition, her lower jaw was found with duct tape attached, which led the prosecution to argue at trial that she had likely died by suffocation, with duct tape as the murder weapon.\n\nMeanwhile, Casey, in jail awaiting trial initially on charges of child neglect, later upgraded to first-degree murder, was far more interested in getting her boyfriend’s phone number on a family call than discussing what had happened with her daughter. When her best friend began crying over Caylee, Casey responded with a contemptuous, “Oh, my god.” By contrast, the case was a huge emotional strain on Casey’s family; in January 2009, George Anthony attempted suicide, which would later be used against him by Casey’s defense at her trial.\n\nEven ignoring all of Casey’s confirmed suspicious behavior, the other circumstantial evidence against her was strong. Casey had claimed that her daughter was abducted far from the Anthony home, but Caylee’s body was found with a Winnie-the-Pooh blanket that matched the theme of her room, and she was wrapped in a canvas laundry bag identified as part of a set belonging to the Anthony household. The location of the remains was just a quarter-mile from the house.\n\nThe day the police were summoned to investigate Caylee’s disappearance, Cindy Anthony told the 911 operator that the trunk of Casey’s car smelled like it had held a dead body, and cadaver dogs brought to the scene immediately alerted upon the trunk. Forensic analysis found “shockingly high” levels of chloroform in the trunk; someone accessing the Anthony’s computer also did a Google search for “chloroform” and spent time browsing the results. On the last day that Caylee was seen alive, June 16, 2008, someone in the Anthony home did a Google search for “fool-proof suffication” [sic], then appeared to read an article that discussed murder by poison and suffocation by smothering.\n\nCasey Anthony’s trial took place in 2011, and it was a media juggernaut: A reported 40 million viewers worldwide tuned into at least some of the trial coverage as it unfolded, with millions viewing the verdict live. Millions also tuned in to Nancy Grace’s nightly repetition of “Tot Mom!” to scathingly refer to Casey’s case.\n\nAt trial, Casey’s defense team dropped the “Zanny the Nanny” story and instead claimed that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the Anthonys’ pool and that George had helped his daughter cover up the death. Her defense attorney, Jose Baez, dropped the bombshell accusation that Casey had been abused by her father, implying that this explained her string of lies and her willingness to protect him.\n\nAgain, there was no evidence for this accusation. But Baez also brought in skilled rebuttal arguments, like that of forensic expert Werner Spitz, to undercut the prosecution’s case. Spitz, for example, argued that the autopsy was poorly conducted and that there was reasonable doubt about the manner of death. In the end, the jury agreed; despite most of them feeling as though Casey “did something wrong,” they voted to acquit — an outcome that shocked the world and reportedly shocked even the judge. She was, however, found guilty of lying to police.\n\nFollowing the trial, Casey seemed to carry on living just as she always had; tabloids intermittently reported sightings of her partying, while she grew estranged from her parents, especially her father, and from her brother. “I don’t give a shit about what anyone thinks about me,” she told the Associated Press in a 2017 interview. “I never will. I’m okay with myself; I sleep pretty good at night.”\n\nCasey Anthony is probably still lying — but does the true crime machine care?\n\nBy 2022, however, Casey Anthony apparently did care what we think. The Peacock series, which focuses on Casey and her defense, was all about trying to shift the narrative toward a Me Too story of lifelong sexual assault and abuse. Once again, her story has changed: She now blamed her estranged father entirely, claiming not only that George Anthony abused her throughout her childhood, but that he also killed Caylee and then intimidated Casey into covering it up.\n\nIt was a hard sell. Reports surfaced in 2021 that Casey Anthony had created a TikTok account and had been posting videos claiming to miss Caylee. It didn’t last long. Years later however, some TikTok users have embraced the idea of her innocence, including some viewers like Rosie O’Donnell in 2022. While they garnered plenty of attention, though, they were firmly in the minority. Reviews of the Peacock series dripped with disdain and revulsion for the entire project: Here’s the Guardian:\n\nThe show doesn’t just make the case for Anthony’s innocence all over again. Parts of it play like a dating show sizzle reel, complete with shots of Anthony garbed in athleisure wear snapping nature photos while out for long walks in the wild — as if we’re not all watching because her kid was found dead in a wood.\n\nFortunately, anyone wanting to do a deep dive into the still-unsolved murder of Caylee Anthony can find plenty of other, more thorough documentaries out there. Oxygen’s The Case of: Caylee Anthony, which features analysis from famed criminologist Laura Richards and retired FBI profiler Jim Clemente, is a quality pick. If a podcast is more your vibe, I would also recommend the coverage of the ladies of RedHanded, who did a two-part look at the case.\n\nHowever, the issue with the documentary wasn’t that people didn’t know anything about Casey Anthony; it was more about the cyclical nature of modern media production. We’re all too familiar with the way Hollywood prefers to invest in reviving old IP and classic franchises rather than banking on something new. That mentality found its way into the ever-lucrative true crime genre, as well. After all, you just can’t magically will a huge, eye-popping true crime story into existence, much less manipulate it into becoming a massive phenomenon, like that of the Watts family, Gabby Petito, or the macabre Murdaugh murders. These cases certainly warrant the attention they receive, but they also compel us to return to them, again and again.\n\nPerhaps, in 2022, after hundreds of books, podcasts, movies, and documentaries about Jeffrey Dahmer, you might have expected Netflix’s new docudrama to be just one more version of a tired story. Instead, Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story was a hit for Netflix, swiftly becoming the second-biggest English-language release in Netflix history and rapidly clocking over a billion streaming views worldwide. Production studios know there’s a hunger for this kind of recycled true crime content. And when the original trial drew viewer ratings like Casey Anthony’s did, perhaps that’s all the motivation needed to revisit a case. Case in point: the Menendez brothers, whose case has gained renewed public support following a wave of new media attention and a splashy Netflix drama.\n\nBut there’s a difference between Anthony’s case and most other recent popular true crime revivals. No one was trying to proclaim innocence for Dahmer or Ted Bundy in their recent revisitations, even if both series did come under fire for being too centered around the killer. Anthony’s acquittal complicates the facts, to be sure, but any series that allows her to tell her own version of events unchallenged is ethically irresponsible at a bare minimum. (The prosecution refused to participate in the series.) What’s more, there’s arguably zero utility served by rehashing Anthony’s case: She was acquitted. There’s no urgent need to get courts to reevaluate her plight. One could argue she deserves a new hearing in the court of public opinion, but if you believe Casey Anthony is innocent, you’ve already validated her.\n\nFrom one perspective, it’s easy to see why Anthony attempted to reframe her narrative in the waning moments of Me Too. It is, perhaps, the most hospitable cultural climate for her to receive a hearing on her version of events — especially her claims of abuse. Over the last few years, reexamining the lives of women maligned by the media, from Marcia Clark to Britney Spears, has become something of a cultural touchstone, often to positive effect. It’s a trend that started to see diminishing returns, however — how much more did we learn, for instance, about Pamela Anderson from Pam & Tommy? Placing Anthony in this same frame seems to assume some level of cultural misunderstanding at the time. But even new information about potential abuse doesn’t change the overwhelming likelihood that she played a primary role in what happened to Caylee.\n\nCasey Anthony isn’t the only suspected killer to benefit from this treatment, however. Take convicted double-murderer Scott Peterson. Peterson, like Anthony, also wove an elaborate web of lies around his pregnant wife Laci’s disappearance. Unlike Anthony, however, Scott Peterson was found guilty of killing his wife and their unborn son; while his conviction was up for appeal on a technicality (improper jury selection), there was no assertion of actual innocence by his defense team. In December 2022, that appeal was denied.\n\nYet the siren call to revisit even cases like Peterson’s, which seem open and shut, has proven hard to resist. A pair of 2016 and 2017 documentaries advocating for Peterson’s innocence led to a growing chorus of supporters. Famous podcasters like the Crime Junkie hosts and more recently justice advocate Rabia Chaudry have asserted his innocence so strongly that they have infuriated many members of the true crime community. This division between true crime fan factions may also reflect something of the exponential growth of the true crime community, which had long been a grassroots movement until Serial exploded on the podcasting scene in 2014. Since then, true crime has ballooned into a modernized media juggernaut, replete with docuseries, podcasts, and even fan conventions. Many of those fans are often criticized for treating true crime as an entertainment playground, much to the alarm of other true crime fans.\n\nThe alarm is understandable, given how much we know about misinformation impacting popular opinion. It’s also certainly the case that web sleuths love a good mystery. Often the facts in criminal cases are just vague enough to allow true crime fans to behave the way we increasingly see those in other fandoms behaving as they dig into the media they love: That is, they lose themselves in the details, spin elaborate theories of the situation, and emerge with complex narratives that fit what they want to believe while rejecting a rational view of all the facts. While this is exactly what we’d prefer our justice system to avoid, the public has no obligation to examine the totality of evidence in a case.\n\nThat’s why one-sided narratives like the Casey Anthony series are so concerning: They risk distorting the truth and misguiding the public.\n\nBut with the arc of true crime bending toward recycling and rehashing settled cases — and with the public eagerly lapping it up — it seems unlikely there’s anything we can do to prevent serial manipulators like Casey Anthony from taking advantage of the public hunger for more information on old cases.\n\nAll we can do, it seems, is respond by repeating the facts — and trust that one day, if only in the court of public opinion, justice will prevail.",

        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for delaying the dissemination of vaccines to help curb an ongoing mpox outbreak which began in May 2022 and spread to more than 120 countries before the virus became largely confined to central and eastern Africa.\n\nIn mid-2022, the US and EU approved an mpox vaccine made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

        "content": "is an editorial director at Vox overseeing the climate, tech, and world teams, and is the editor of Vox’s Future Perfect section. He worked at Time magazine for 15 years as a foreign correspondent in Asia, a climate writer, and an international editor, and he wrote a book on existential risk.\n\nWelcome to the first edition of Good News, the weekly newsletter dedicated to covering the remarkable, optimistic things happening all around us.\n\nNow, I know what you might be thinking: “Good news? In today’s environment? Has the author recently suffered a head injury?”\n\nAnd that’s just a sampling of headlines from the past few days.\n\nSo why launch a newsletter dedicated to good news when the news seems worse than it’s ever been? Because even amid the blizzard of bad, good news is happening all around us — we just can’t see it. We’re so stuck in the present that we fail to understand just how much life has improved over the medium and long term.\n\nTake the headlines above. Yes, there is war happening around us, and conflict really has worsened in recent years, as shown by Ukraine and other fronts. But international conflict used to be far more common and orders of magnitude more deadly than it is today. Stories of battles and casualties in one place can cause us to miss more hopeful stories elsewhere: Did you know a decades-old insurgency that has killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey may finally be on the brink of ending?\n\nThe health of democracy at home and abroad is discouraging, to say the least, given recent developments. But we should remember how novel representative government is — as recently as 1950, fewer than 15 percent of countries were considered democracies of any kind, and less than 6 percent qualified as true liberal democracies. Go back much further than that, and they were virtually nonexistent. That puts our current troubles in a very different context.\n\nRelated How progress creates its own obstacles\n\nI haven’t even mentioned the constant stream of scientific discoveries and innovations that arrive almost daily, especially in medicine. A new encyclopedia of protein-coding genes; a mathematical model that could help revive coral reefs; a better way to deliver gene editing therapies; the first fetus to receive life-saving medication before birth. All of this, too, has happened over just the past few days. Chances are, you just didn’t hear about it.\n\nAll of which raises the question: Why aren’t you hearing about it? I can think of three reasons.\n\nThe media has a bad news bias\n\nI’ve spent nearly 25 years as a professional journalist. So I feel I have some authority when I tell you that the media really does have a notable bias. However, it’s not for Democrats or Republicans, neoliberalism or progressive economics, woke or not woke. It’s a bias for bad news.\n\nAs my colleague over here at Future Perfect Dylan Matthews wrote a few years ago, there’s a large body of academic research that concludes that the news we read, watch, and listen to tends to have a negative bent. One 2022 study found that the “proportion of headlines denoting anger, fear, disgust and sadness” grew notably in the US between 2000 and 2019.\n\nPutting on my journalist hat with the tag reading “PRESS” sticking out of the band, I can tell you that this tracks with my experience. Something going wrong is inherently more newsworthy than something going right. For example: The fact that 3 million people flew in and out of US airports and none of them died in an accident isn’t news, while a single crash most definitely is, even though you are far more likely to be in the first group than the second. (I mean way more likely — based on data between 2010 and 2024, there were only one or two passenger fatalities on regularly scheduled flights per light-year traveled. That’s nearly 5.9 trillion miles.)\n\nThere are very good reasons journalists have this bad news bias. One of the most important functions of the press is as a watchdog — and a watchdog barks when something is amiss. We in the media should keep doing this. But it does distract us from the stories of things simply working and the slower-moving stories of real progress. (Here’s one: Between 2000 and 2022, the child mortality rate globally fell by more than half, which translates to millions of children living who would otherwise be dead. As a parent myself of a young child, I cannot imagine a better story than that.)\n\nThe problem for the news audience is that all that watchdog barking means that we can end up with a view of the world that is far bleaker than it actually is. And all of you play a part in that because …\n\nThe audience has a bad news bias\n\nIt’s been a long time since I took Econ 101, and as I recall I got a B. But I do remember the concept of supply and demand.\n\nIf the media’s natural bad news bias is the supply, then the audience’s inclination toward consuming all that bad news is the demand. And boy, do we love it!\n\nIn Dylan’s story that I mentioned in the previous section, he wrote about a fascinating 17-country study that tried to measure how people reacted to positive- and negative-seeming news by watching “seven randomly ordered BBC World News stories in a laptop computer while wearing noise-cancelling headphones and sensors on their fingers to capture skin conductance and blood volume pulse.” (Basically my usual Friday night.)\n\nThe researchers found that negative news led to stronger physiological reactions and grabbed more attention than positive or normal news on average. One study in Nature found that people were 1 percent less likely to click on a headline for each positive word in the headline.\n\nOf course, social media, with its unerring ability to optimize our feeds for outrage, has only amplified that tendency. Think about the last story you shared on social media, or in a group chat with friends. Chances are, it was a negative one. And part of the reason we are so attracted to negative news is …\n\nOur brains have a bad news bias\n\nHere’s something you should know about me. Like 21 million other Americans, I suffer from depression.\n\nThankfully, I’ve been able to manage that condition with regular talk therapy and medication. But I still notice the way that depressive tendencies color my outlook. I feel the pull of pessimism, an inclination toward the negative, a penchant for seeing the worst in things.\n\nRealistic optimism isn’t just about feeling better.\n\nWhen I share these feelings with my therapist, he has a ready saying: “Your mind is not being a good friend to you.” What he means is that my melancholy, if we want to get 19th century about it, causes me to see the world, and myself, as darker than it is in reality. In other words, I have a bad news bias.\n\nYou don’t have to suffer from depression for this to happen to you. What’s known as “negativity bias” is one of the most well-established findings in psychology. As one paper put it, when it comes to the human mind, “bad is stronger than good.” It’s a fact of human nature that predates social media, the media, maybe even civilization itself.\n\nIt is a product of evolution. Early human beings who couldn’t reliably identify and respond to threats probably didn’t last very long on the savannah, which made this bias a useful adaptation — even if it meant we weren’t seeing the world the way it really was.\n\nToday, though, most of humanity — and definitely most of the people reading this piece — are thankfully no longer in a position where we’re facing threats to life and limb on a regular basis. Chances are we’re pretty comfortable most of the time, about as secure as human beings have ever been.\n\nBut the worry and the negativity don’t go away just because the world has gotten safer in aggregate. If we’re to see the world as it really is, with its true mix of bad and good, we need to retrain our brains to look at things differently. So think of this newsletter as a pair of rose-tinted glasses that will help you see things just a little bit more clearly.\n\nSome people may think that actively focusing on optimism in a moment of real crisis like the one we’re experiencing now will only lead to complacency — but I disagree. As Max Roser, the founder of the great progress data site Our World in Data, has said: “The world is awful. The world is much better. The world can be much better.” Realistic optimism isn’t just about feeling better. You have to believe the world is worth saving to build a movement that will improve it.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. Sign up here!",

        "title": "America’s kids are already suffering under Trump’s education policies",
        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent for Vox, where she covers American family life, work, and education. Previously, she was an editor and writer at the New York Times. She is also the author of three novels, including the New York Times bestseller Outlawed.\n\nOne of President Donald Trump’s biggest targets in his second term has been the Education Department, a federal agency established in 1979 that oversees the enforcement of federal law in schools. He’s called the department “a big con job,” and expressed his hope that Linda McMahon, confirmed on Monday to head the agency, will “put herself out of a job.”\n\nIn an email to the department just after her confirmation, McMahon called on staffers to “join us in this historic final mission,” which she described as “a last chance to restore the culture of liberty and excellence that made American education great.”\n\n“They’re really gutting it from within,” said Blair Wriston, senior manager for government affairs at EdTrust, an education equity nonprofit. “The people who suffer are going to be the kids.”\n\nIt’s not just children. In addition to bolstering underfunded K-12 schools and protecting the rights of kids with disabilities, the department also manages the federal financial aid process for college students. “I am not certain whether or not students will be able to get financial aid next year,” Dominique Baker, a professor of education and public policy at the University of Delaware, told Vox.\n\nThe Education Department’s critics misrepresent it as a tool for the federal government to exert control over schools. It’s actually an agency tasked with supporting the nation’s most underserved students while also overseeing the massive and complex ecosystem of federal student loans — and disrupting those functions could affect students and families across the country.\n\nWhat the Education Department does\n\nFirst, let’s talk about what the Education Department doesn’t do. It does not set K-12 curricula or tell schools what to teach. That’s up to states and individual districts. So when Trump says he wants to get rid of the Education Department in order to send education “back to the states,” it’s somewhat misleading, because state and local governments are already in charge of what kids learn in schools.\n\nWhat the department does do is “implement all of the federal laws and policies that focus on schools,” Baker said. At the K-12 level, a lot of that work involves supporting vulnerable and underserved students, said Kenneth Wong, a professor of education policy at Brown University.\n\nUnder a program known as Title I, the department sends federal money to schools with a high percentage of low-income students to help them hire additional teachers or otherwise bolster core subject areas like reading, Wong said. The federal government makes up about 14 percent of school budgets overall, according to the Associated Press, but low-income schools receive additional funding.\n\nThe department also sends money to states under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), helping schools provide small class sizes and other supports for students with disabilities and learning differences that state governments wouldn’t be able to afford on their own.\n\nWhile these programs are important to many elementary, middle, and high schools around the country, the Education Department plays an even bigger role with colleges and universities, Baker said. It makes sure the application for federal financial aid, the FAFSA, is available to students, that the information students enter is sent to colleges, and that the money is actually disbursed.\n\nThe department also helps make sure that for-profit colleges “aren’t scamming students,” Baker said, by controlling which institutions get access to federal student aid.\n\nTwo other key functions to know about: the Education Department serves as a “watchdog for student civil rights” at K-12 schools and colleges, Wriston said. If students with disabilities aren’t getting the support they need to access their legal right to an education — supports that can range from wheelchair ramps to occupational therapy to a one-on-one aide — their families can file a complaint with the department’s Office for Civil Rights. Students and families can also file with the office if they believe they’ve experienced racial discrimination at school.\n\nAnd through the Institute of Education Sciences, the department conducts research on education around the country, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests, probably the best source of nationwide data on students’ reading and math skills. “The vast majority of any statistics that we know about schooling comes from data that’s collected by the federal government,” Baker said.\n\nWhat Trump wants to do, and what DOGE is already doing\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how the Trump administration might go about “closing” the Education Department. He cannot fully eliminate the department without help from Congress, and while legislation to do so has been introduced, it’s unlikely to pass the closely divided House and Senate. Instead, Trump could seek to move some parts of the department to other agencies — Project 2025, a blueprint for much of the Trump administration’s actions thus far, calls for converting Title I funds into grants to the states, and moving the Office for Civil Rights to the Department of Justice.\n\nBut DOGE isn’t waiting for an executive order, terminating dozens of contracts at the Institute of Education Sciences in February. Though the cuts reportedly don’t affect the NAEP tests, much of the work of the Institute “has ground to a standstill,” Baker said.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 60 department employees have been terminated, including people responsible for civil rights and financial aid, with the potential of more layoffs in the future. (The Education Department has about 4,400 employees.) Last Friday, employees received an email offering them $25,000 if they agreed to quit by Monday; the message also said “a very significant reduction in force” was coming, according to the New York Times.\n\nRegardless of what happens with any future executive order, the Trump administration and DOGE “are actively dismantling the department,” Wriston said.\n\nHow gutting the Education Department hurts students\n\nThat dismantling is already having an effect on students. As soon as Trump was inaugurated, the department’s processing of disability rights complaints ground to a halt, families told the Associated Press. That has left students — including a 12-year-old boy with autism and epilepsy who’s been unwillingly assigned to remote schooling — without recourse and, in some cases, losing precious weeks and months of learning.\n\nInstead, the department has focused on trans athletes and all-gender bathrooms. The agency also sent a letter to school leaders saying they could face investigation if they take steps to diversify their teaching staff or recruit students of color for selective programs, according to Chalkbeat.\n\nMeanwhile, cuts at the Institute of Education Sciences include programs addressing young children’s literacy and improving the transition out of high school for students with disabilities, Wriston said. Dismantling the Institute is especially ironic at a time of nationwide concern over declining NAEP scores, he said. “We’re going to gut the agency completely that’s doing the real work here of gathering the research and evidence to help inform our practices.”\n\nWithout the data the institute collects, it will also be more difficult for taxpayers to see the impact that cuts by the federal government might have on kids’ education, Baker said.\n\nAt the college level, meanwhile, experts fear a breakdown in the basic systems that allow students to apply for, use, and repay their student loans. Without a functioning Education Department, it’s not clear how students’ financial information will be collected and sent to universities for financial aid decisions, or who will certify borrowers’ income for income-based repayment plans, Baker said. The department already struggled with the rollout of a new FAFSA last year, and given canceled contracts and other changes under the new administration, “I don’t know why anyone would expect smooth sailing next year,” Baker said.\n\nGutting the research and oversight functions of the department could also make it easier for colleges to lie to students about their graduation rates and the success of their graduates, experts say.\n\nOver the long term, parceling out programs like Title I and IDEA to other departments — each with their own functions and priorities — could weaken those programs’ ability to serve the high-needs students they were created to support, Wong said. The Education Department is (or was) full of experts who have spent their careers serving students, and other departments simply won’t have the same expertise. And, of course, those other departments are also on the chopping block in the DOGE era, Wriston pointed out.\n\nAs Trump and DOGE move forward with their plans, advocates and voters can respond by “elevating the stories and the perspectives of impacted communities, of families and students and educators who are being impacted by this,” Wriston said. “Those perspectives are critical right now.”\n\nWhile students and families are the most directly impacted by changes at the Education Department, those changes have also inspired a broader concern. Some of the programs terminated by DOGE are congressionally mandated, and if the president or Musk can simply stop them, “that means that Congress no longer actually functions,” Baker said.\n\n“There are no longer checks and balances for the executive branch,” Baker said. “A significant part of this goes beyond education and speaks to a constitutional crisis that shapes the future of our country.”",

Neil Hall/EPA/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA blowup at the White House on Friday proved a rude awakening for some of the US’s closest partners in Europe, and left them scrambling to contemplate a world in which they can no longer be sure that the US is a reliable ally in Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nIn the wake of President Donald Trump and his team accosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a heated, televised exchange in the Oval Office, European leaders met to devise a plan for protecting Ukraine from Russian aggression absent any security guarantees from the US.\n\nAnd though multiple leaders, from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to NATO leader Mark Rutte, insisted that they still view the US as an important partner, the meeting nevertheless seemed like it might mark the abrupt beginning of a new Western world order — one in which Europe stands alone.\n\nThe UK and France have led efforts in recent weeks to advance Ukraine’s cause and to convince Trump to keep Ukraine’s (and Europe’s) best interests in mind as he attempts to craft a ceasefire or peace deal in Russia’s years-long war on Ukraine.\n\nSunday, Starmer presided over a summit of more than a dozen mostly European leaders and announced that the attendees would form a “coalition of the willing” to defend Ukraine and strengthen Europe’s military capabilities.\n\n“Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back,” Starmer said. “Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency.”\n\nStarmer did emphasize, however, that many in the group, including the UK, believe lasting peace will not be possible without US support. And while Starmer said he had a productive conversation with Trump about Ukraine this weekend, it’s not clear that US support will materialize.\n\nThat’s in part because the Trump administration and its allies reiterated throughout the weekend that they believe their current approach to peace — that is, holding talks with Russia sans Ukraine and blaming Ukraine for the war — is the right one. Trump adviser Elon Musk suggested on X that the US contemplate leaving the NATO security alliance.\n\nThe Trump team also redoubled their attacks on Zelenskyy on Sunday, with some going so far as to suggest the Ukrainian president ought to be replaced.\n\n“The sooner everyone grows up around here and figures out that this is a bad war that’s heading in a bad direction...the more progress we’re going to be able to make,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on ABC Sunday. “But the president is crystal clear...he is going to be a president that tries to achieve peace.”\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth also announced Sunday that the Pentagon will cease offensive cyber operations against Russia — a tactic that could be seen as an olive branch to Russian President Vladimir Putin, meant to ease peace negotiations. European leaders — who have faced covert Russian attacks on their soil in recent months — warned against the move, arguing Putin cannot be trusted.\n\nAll of this tumult comes as Trump attempts to fulfill a campaign promise to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. But it also seems to be a case of Trump getting something he’s long demanded: that Europe increase its defense contributions while the US takes a step back from the conflict.\n\nEurope appears to be doing just that now.\n\nThe UK announced over the weekend that it will send $2 billion in air defense missiles to Ukraine and will increase military spending by 2.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2027.\n\nOther countries may make similar commitments. But it may not be enough for Europe to stand alone against Russia in the short term after decades of underinvestment in defense.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect section, with a focus on animal welfare and the future of meat.\n\nThis is the final story in a series of articles on how factory farming has shaped the US. Find the rest of the series and future installments here, and visit Vox’s Future Perfect section for more coverage of Big Ag. The stories in this series are supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.\n\nFor years, Jeff Simmons — the president and CEO of the large US pharmaceutical company Elanco — ridiculed a seemingly unlikely target on social media: the plant-based meat industry.\n\nAs startups like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods rose to prominence, Simmons attacked veggie burgers and meat-free chicken as highly processed foods that “won’t do” in the effort to feed a growing population. (Even though experts widely acknowledge that plant-based meat would, in fact, better help feed a growing population, as it requires less land and water and generates far less greenhouse gas emissions than animal meat.)\n\nBut take a closer look at Elanco, and Simmons’s opposition isn’t all that surprising. The company he runs, which spun off from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly in 2019, is a world leader in developing and marketing pharmaceuticals — including antibiotics and vaccines — for both pets and livestock.\n\nIn the US, nearly all meat, milk, and eggs come from factory farms, which are prone to being overcrowded, stressful, disease-ridden environments where animals are especially susceptible to infections. Products from companies like Elanco are integral to preventing and treating those inevitable infections, serving an essential role in industrial animal agriculture.\n\nPigs at a factory farm in North Carolina. Callaghan O’Hare/Bloomberg Turkeys at a factory farm in Michigan. Rudy Malmquist\n\nIf plant-based meat were ever to displace some of the conventional meat supply, it would mean fewer factory-farmed animals, and thus less profit for Elanco.\n\n“Alternatives to animal-derived protein,” among other things, the company wrote in a 2019 financial report, “could negatively affect the market for our products.”\n\nIn the press and on social media, Simmons has also exaggerated the potential of technology to slash livestock emissions. In 2021, he claimed — without citing evidence — that some cattle operations could reach net zero emissions within a decade, and that we shouldn’t expend energy on changing people’s diets to fight climate change. That flies in the face of consensus from climate scientists and agriculture experts, who, in a 2021 survey, overwhelmingly agreed that rich- and middle-income countries need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, which currently account for about 15 to 20 percent of global emissions, and that slashing meat and dairy consumption is the most effective way to do it.\n\nOn conference stages, Simmons has criticized Bill Gates’s bullish support for meat alternatives and a Chipotle marketing campaign critical of factory farming, while another Elanco executive criticized raising animal welfare standards for chickens.\n\nElanco declined an interview request for this story and didn’t respond to a list of detailed questions. “For 70 years, Elanco has pioneered ways to improve animal health and wellbeing and raise livestock more sustainably,” the company wrote in a statement to Vox. “We work alongside farmers and veterinarians to bring forward leading innovations in nutrition and diet management, digestion optimization as well as on-farm sustainability solutions.”\n\nThe company’s work can be thought of as part of the “animal-industrial complex” — a network of companies, governments, and public and private research centers that, according to sociologist Richard Twine at Edge Hill University in the UK, make up the factory farm system, promote its continued existence and expansion, and defend it from criticism.\n\nJeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco Animal Health Inc., center, applauds while ringing the opening bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2018. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n“There’s a lot of effort being put into protecting business as usual,” Twine said.\n\nThat animal-industrial complex encompasses meat, milk, and egg companies and their trade associations, pharmaceutical companies like Elanco, genetics companies that breed farm animals to grow bigger and faster, and the seed, fertilizer, and farm equipment companies involved in growing animal feed. It also includes public institutions, such as industry-friendly agencies like the US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration, and even land-grant universities that receive funding from and partner with the meat industry on its research priorities.\n\nThe entities within this ecosystem work to boost meat production and sales, shape public policy, and amplify messaging that improves consumer perception of animal products. Both money and personnel flow between the different players.\n\nElanco, for example, sponsors meat industry conferences and awards, funds livestock industry groups and serves on their boards, and has published research with industry-friendly academics claiming that US dairy farming can achieve “climate neutrality.”\n\nElanco isn’t alone. Merck Animal Health — a division of Merck, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies — and Zoetis, which in 2013 spun off from the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, engage in some of the same activities, like sponsoring meat industry conferences.\n\nZoetis didn’t respond to a request for comment and Merck Animal Health declined an interview request. The Animal Health Institute, a trade group that represents the animal pharmaceutical industry, didn’t respond to a list of detailed questions about the industry and pointed me to progress reports from the intergovernmental World Organization for Animal Health and the trade group HealthforAnimals.\n\nProcessing Meat A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

That system helped make meat, milk, and eggs more affordable and abundant, and lower their per-pound carbon footprint.\n\nBut it also has contributed to serious animal welfare, environmental, and public health concerns, including antimicrobial-resistant germs or “superbugs,” which adapt and build resilience against the antibiotics laced in farmed animals’ feed and water. When these germs escape the farm and infect humans, antibiotics are ineffective at treating them, which can make common ailments difficult or even impossible to heal. Heavy antibiotic use in livestock, along with overuse of antibiotics in humans, is a significant driver of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, which killed over one million people worldwide in 2019 and played a role in an additional 4.95 million deaths.\n\nAround 70 percent of antibiotics important in human medicine are fed to farmed animals, both in the US and globally. The World Health Organization has called for significant reductions and considers antimicrobial resistance “one of the top global public health and development threats.”\n\nThat crisis can be partly pinned on the pharmaceutical companies that helped to build factory farming, undermining their stated missions of improving human and animal health. After decades of increasing pressure from consumers, public health experts, and US policymakers, some of these pharma companies have in recent years pledged to move away from antibiotics, but little progress has been made. And through it all, animal pharma companies have remained set on further expanding factory farming in the US and around the globe.\n\nHow Big Pharma helped build factory farming\n\nIn the interwar period, the discovery of antibiotics like Prontosil and penicillin led to a pharmaceutical revolution, enabling doctors to quickly heal common bacterial infections in humans that until then had often been life-threatening. The drugs soon became mass-produced and affordable, and more antibiotic discoveries followed.\n\nIt wasn’t long until pharmaceutical leaders like Pfizer looked for markets beyond human medicine. They found it on the farm, according to Claas Kirchhelle, a medical historian at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research who documents the rise of antibiotics in agriculture in his book Pyrrhic Progress: The History of Antibiotics in Anglo-American Food Production.\n\nBy the late 1940s, researchers came to understand that when farmed animals are fed regular, low doses of certain antibiotics, they gain weight faster on less feed and better stave off disease, Kirchhelle explains in his book.\n\nThis one-two punch of disease prevention and rapid weight gain suddenly made it more feasible to pack large numbers of animals in barns, while having fewer animals die from infectious diseases and shortening the amount of time it took for animals to reach their “market weight.” These became two hallmarks of factory farming, enabling farmers to squeeze more meat out of each animal and increase profits.\n\nAntibiotic adoption in the meat industry was swift: By 1951, around 16 percent of antibiotics sold in the US went to livestock; by 1970, it reached 43 percent.\n\nA veterinarian preparing a vaccine for a dairy cow. Sutthichai Supapornpasupad\n\nAmerica’s precipitous increase in meat production after World War II, facilitated in part by antibiotics, was widely celebrated as a solution to Malthusian fears that humanity wouldn’t be able to feed a rapidly growing global population. “For patriotic US researchers, politicians, and journalists, promulgating agricultural plenty and efficiency-boosting technologies like antibiotics became a moral duty,” Kirchhelle writes.\n\nBy the 1960s, scientists paid increasing attention to the antimicrobial resistance threat posed by animal agriculture. Strains of bacterial diseases like salmonella and E. coli can adapt and build resistance to those antibiotics and then leave the farm and infect humans in a number of ways: improperly cooked meat, livestock manure leaching into drinking water or rivers and streams, or on the clothes of a farm owner or worker.\n\nBut the US Food and Drug Administration, which oversees animal pharmaceuticals, for decades failed to take the issue seriously and downplayed warnings. In the 1970s, the agency did make an earnest attempt to limit the use of two classes of human-critical antibiotics in livestock, but it was thwarted by a burgeoning coalition of livestock and pharmaceutical business interests. According to Kirchhelle, this coalition also funded a separate organization to conduct “counter science” to muddy the scientific debate over the proposed ban, which included organizing experts to write a report that was then edited without the researchers’ consent.\n\nIt wasn’t until the mid-2010s that the FDA took two basic but important actions to meaningfully address the problem: requiring farmers to get veterinarian prescriptions for medically important antibiotics, and asking — though not requiring — animal pharmaceutical companies to remove language on product labels about antibiotics’ ability to make animals grow faster. Sales of antibiotics soon fell rapidly.\n\nIt represented progress, but not enough, according to Gail Hansen, an antimicrobial expert and former state public health veterinarian in Kansas. Hansen told me the agency’s actions represented a compromise that was favorable to industry compared to what some high-ranking members of Congress were pushing for at the time: significant antibiotic use restrictions and increased transparency from drug makers on how their antibiotics were used in livestock.\n\nPharma companies wanted to change antibiotic use “on their own terms and not the government telling them what to do,” according to Hansen. “If they could show just a little bit of good faith,” by complying with the FDA, they could stave off stricter regulation.\n\nPharma and Big Ag still can’t quit antibiotics\n\nOver the last decade, livestock pharma companies have found themselves at a crossroads. Under growing scrutiny from public health experts and policymakers, the biggest players in the sector have committed to “antimicrobial stewardship,” promising to wean farmers off medically important antibiotics by investing in vaccine development, nutritional supplements like enzymes and probiotics, and animal-only antibiotics, which aren’t used in human medicine.\n\nBut while the FDA’s actions cut antibiotic use on farms from 2015 to 2017, corporate efforts since then have seemingly failed to move the needle: Sales of medically important antibiotics increased 10 percent from 2017 to 2023, and the US remains far behind Europe, where in 2020, antibiotic use per animal was about half that of the US. The continent slashed antibiotic use through tougher regulations, better farm hygiene, and relying more on vaccines, enzymes, probiotics, and other products to prevent disease, according to Leon Marchal, a Netherlands-based innovation director at IFF Health & Bioscience, which develops and sells animal health products.\n\nDespite the animal pharmaceutical industry’s stated commitments to antimicrobial stewardship, some of their actions have suggested a reluctance to move away from the drugs. In 2023, the share of Elanco’s revenue from medically important antibiotics, for both pets and livestock, stood at 10 percent, down just 2 percent from 2018.\n\nIn 2018, the company ran an advertising campaign designed to assuage consumer concerns over antibiotics in meat production. And at a major pork industry conference the same year, Elanco handed out brochures encouraging farmers to feed pigs a pair of antibiotics to make the animals grow fatter. But a few years earlier, the FDA had told one of Elanco’s subsidiaries that drug combination was unsafe and shouldn’t be promoted to increase weight gain. Elanco committed to stop distributing the brochures after the New York Times inquired about it.\n\n“For more than 15 years, we’ve been focused on increasing responsible antibiotic use, reducing the need for antibiotics and improving the health of animals through vaccines, nutrition and other efforts,” Elanco wrote in a statement to Vox. “Most importantly, Elanco has focused on expanding access to animal-only antibiotics, which don’t create a threat to human resistance, and creating antibiotic alternatives, including vaccines, enzymes, probiotic and prebiotics.”\n\nAround the same time, Zoetis was using similar messaging when selling human-relevant antibiotics to farmers in India, where, like in other middle-income countries, poultry factory farming is quickly expanding. The company told the press that it was following India’s antibiotics regulations.\n\nRelated How factory farming built America\n\nAs the reputational risk of selling medically important antibiotics in the US rises, some of the biggest animal pharmaceutical companies are moving on to what Elanco has called its “next economic opportunity”: mitigating climate change. In 2018, the company gained FDA approval for a drug that reduces ammonia emissions in cattle; Zoetis has also announced research efforts to develop a similar product. Last year, the FDA completed its review of Elanco’s Bovaer product — a powder that when fed to dairy cows daily can reduce emissions from their methane-rich burps — and deemed it safe and effective.\n\n“We’re committed to bringing innovative solutions that allow farmers and ranchers to reduce and measure emissions,” the company wrote in a statement to Vox.\n\nThese products have the potential to reduce some types of cattle-caused emissions, but by much less than we could by simply eating far fewer animal products and more of the plant-based foods that Elanco executives have attacked. But companies that depend on factory farming would prefer we keep engineering animals’ diets for maximum productivity, and now, minimal environmental liability, rather than reach for a veggie burger or glass of soy milk.\n\nThis new class of emission-reducing feed products may come with a sustainable sheen, but they’re in keeping with how the industry views animals — not as living, feeling creatures, but as machines whose diets and environments must be endlessly fine-tuned with chemical inputs to compensate for unhygienic farms, poor animal welfare, and a sizable carbon footprint. Even as policy leaders in wealthy countries begin to wake up to the costs of this system, it continues to grow bigger and more entrenched.\n\nThis “model of food production,” Kirchhelle said, “is becoming more and more the dominant mode of producing animals worldwide.”",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent and editor for Vox’s Future Perfect, covering global health. He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.\n\nNearly 150 people have been infected with measles in Texas and New Mexico, and last week, Texas health officials confirmed the first death in the ongoing outbreak: an unvaccinated child. While almost all of the infected are believed to be unvaccinated, five of them told the Texas health department they have received at least one measles shot.\n\nThe United States declared measles eradicated in 2000 because the disease was no longer spreading locally (most cases in the following years were linked to travel to countries where the virus was still prevalent) But in recent years, outbreaks of the measles have been growing as more people across the country opt not to vaccinate. The recent reports of cases even among vaccinated people have added another layer of anxiety to the crisis. More than 90 percent of Americans got their measles shot as a kid. Exactly how reliable is that protection, given this news?\n\nFirst of all, there is no need to panic. It is not clear whether the five people who contracted measles were vaccinated as children. The Texas health department told me they were investigating, but they “wouldn’t classify” these as breakthrough infections. Lara Anton, a department spokesperson, told me unvaccinated people who have been exposed to measles are given a vaccine within 72 hours if possible because it could reduce the severity of their symptoms.\n\n“We are looking into how many of these cases received a dose of MMR after they were exposed to the virus,” Anton said.\n\nTo be clear, breakthrough cases can happen. But the risk today remains very low — only about three in 100 people who receive two vaccine doses get sick when exposed. As Aaron Milstone, an infectious disease pediatrician at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, put it to me, you don’t really have anything to worry about right now if you don’t live in west Texas or eastern New Mexico.\n\n“We don’t want everyone to go out and think, I need to get boosted,” Milstone said.\n\nBut if you do live in those areas or you’re not sure of your vaccine status or you simply want to be proactive about your health, there are some things you can easily do to check on your measles immunity. Here’s what you should know.\n\nWhy breakthrough measles cases happen\n\nOur measles protection strategy has evolved over the decades. People born before 1957, shortly before the first measles vaccine was introduced, are generally thought to have natural immunity because they were usually exposed to the virus as children. Those born before 1989 likely received at least one dose, which was the guidance during that period. After 1989, the recommendation increased to two doses, one around your first birthday and another around age 5.\n\nThat change was made because a small percentage of people did not respond to only one measles shot. But “almost everybody” responded to two doses, Milstone said.\n\nAs measles outbreaks become more common and more vaccinated people become exposed naturally for the first time in a long time, some small number of them may get sick, Milstone said.\n\nAnd, for a long time after that, measles vaccination rates were very high, above the 95 percent threshold experts say is necessary to keep the disease at bay. As a result, measles wasn’t spreading widely within the US and most years saw zero or at most a handful of deaths caused by the virus.\n\nBut measles vaccination rates have been declining. There had always been small insular communities that abstained from vaccinations; the current Texas outbreak has reportedly been primarily concentrated in a Mennonite community. But vaccine hesitancy has become more mainstream, particularly as it’s been embraced by some Republican leaders; several GOP-led states have acted to allow more vaccine exemptions in recent years. The share of Republican voters who think routine childhood vaccinations should be required to attend public school has dramatically fallen off since the pandemic.\n\nIn the 2019–2020 school year, 20 states were still above the 95 percent vaccination rate threshold and just three had dropped below 90 percent. But for the 2023–2024 school year, only 11 states had more than 95 percent of schoolchildren vaccinated against the disease and 14 states had fallen under 90 percent.\n\nIt’s no surprise then that we’re seeing more measles outbreaks. The Texas outbreak alone already accounts for more than half of the total number of US measles cases in 2024, which was itself one of the most active years in recent memory.\n\nIt is possible that measles immunity in some people can wane over time. As measles outbreaks become more common and more vaccinated people become exposed naturally for the first time in a long time, some small number of them may get sick, Milstone said.\n\nWhat you can do to make sure you’re protected\n\nAs Milstone told me, this remains a hypothetical risk for the vast majority of Americans, unless you are near an active outbreak. For now, the outbreak spreading at the Texas-New Mexico border is pretty contained.\n\nEven so, we are now living in a world where you are more likely to see a measles outbreak in your community. Other people may simply want to be assuaged or to exercise some agency about their own health — especially if, for example, they are at higher risk from viral infections because they are immunocompromised or have chronic health conditions.\n\nHere’s what you can do. First, check your vaccination records if you can find them. If you did receive two doses, you almost certainly had an immune response. If you received one dose, you probably did too, but it is a bit more likely that measles immunity never took, Milstone said. For those in this group, considering a measles booster is reasonable.\n\nEither way, the next step if you want to investigate further would be to talk to your doctor (as always, with anything regarding your health). They can administer a “titer test” that measures the measles antibodies in your body. If they’re still present — great, you’re protected. If they’re not, you can talk to your doctor about getting an additional measles shot.\n\nThis is a new era for public health. Milstone said he and his fellow infectious disease doctors could not believe it when they heard the news of a child’s death from measles in the United States.\n\nIt remains entirely preventable by getting vaccinated. And if you are not sure about your immunization, you can take these simple steps to figure out your status. With the death of a school-aged child last week, the stakes are unfortunately all too clear.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior politics reporter at Vox, where he covers the Democratic Party. He joined Vox in 2022 after reporting on national and international politics for the Atlantic’s politics, global, and ideas teams, including the role of Latino voters in the 2020 election.\n\nOn a random Tuesday in February, a conservative provocateur and talk radio host made a bold proclamation about the state of the Democratic Party. Donald Trump had won over young men, and nearly a majority of young voters overall in November, because “Democrats, for men, are pussies.”\n\n“There are no masculine men in the Democrat Party right now,” Clay Travis, the Trump-supporting sports and politics commentator, said while speaking on a panel hosted at the University of Chicago. “Who’s the most masculine Democrat right now in America? Mayor Pete?”\n\nHis audience gasped in response. The moderator intervened. And so began a week of debate and commentary about the relationship — or lack thereof — between the Trump-era Democratic Party and the Gen Z men who abandoned them last year.\n\nIn hindsight, all the signs were there that the 2024 election would feature a yawning gender gap between Trump-curious men, and more liberal women. What polls predicted came true: a shift of Gen Z voters toward Republicans, driven by young men voting for Trump. Since then, plenty of postmortems have tried to wrestle with just what went wrong with the Democratic pitch. Still, the question remains: Will this dynamic linger? And if so, how worried should Democrats be?\n\nA month into the second Trump presidency, the alarm bells are still ringing. While the president’s honeymoon is fading, he remains quite popular with the youngest cohort of men.\n\nAs Democrats attempt to redefine themselves ahead of next year’s midterm elections, they’ll need to accurately diagnose why young men have jumped ship in large numbers.\n\nIn reviewing the data and talking to experts, three main explanations emerge.\n\nFirst, there’s the structural: the effects and aftermath of the Covid pandemic and economic pressures that explain the shift of young men to the right.\n\nThen, there are Trump-specific dynamics, related to his persona, his campaign and media strategy last year, and his ability to define himself independently of the two-party, liberal-conservative spectrum.\n\nAnd finally, there are cultural, education, and gender dynamics that explain the divide — which Democrats have driven, and can still fix.\n\nBut if Democrats are to make any progress, their first step must be rooting out denial: When it comes to young men, the party has a real problem.\n\nWhat the Democrats’ young male problem looks like\n\nThe Gen Z gender gap isn’t easy to map out, so it’s helpful to look at a few factors — vote choice, political ideology, partisan identification, and favorability ratings — to try to figure out what’s going on.\n\nThe first, vote choice, is the easiest, but also bluntest, tool to use. Using estimates from AP VoteCast surveys, in 2024, young men backed Trump by a 14-point margin; young women backed Harris by a 17-point margin. Trump’s share of the young male vote increased from 41 percent in 2020 to 56 percent in 2024 per AP VoteCast data by CIRCLE at Tufts University. And it’s young white and Latino men who shifted most dramatically to the right, by 22 points and 38 points respectively.\n\nPartisan identification shows some of this change too. Over the last 20 years, it’s young men who have been more likely to identify as Republicans, according to Gallup polling data. The share of young women, aged 18-29, who identify as or lean toward Democrats has remained steady since about 2003, while the share of young men who identify with Republicans has steadily grown since 2015.\n\nPuzzlingly, the change in partisan leaning has not been accompanied by a corresponding self-reported change in young men’s political ideology. They have not been calling themselves more “conservative” over that same timeline. Instead, it’s young women who have gotten much more liberal over the last two decades, while the share of men who call themselves conservative has remained steady. According to Gallup polling, women 18 to 29 who call themselves liberal are now at the highest level they’ve been since 1999, a trend that picked up during the second Obama term and the first Trump presidency. A plurality of young men, meanwhile, have called themselves moderate over the last 20 years, with shares of young conservatives and young liberals also remaining steady.\n\nWhat this all suggests is two opposite shifts: Young women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative. It’s a point that Daniel Cox, the director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, was trying to make on the same panel that Travis blew up at the University of Chicago. His argument is that issues, and the positions the political parties are taking, only explain so much.\n\nYoung women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative.\n\n“You have a slow decline. This didn’t happen in just one election. There’s been a deterioration of Democratic identity among young men for over 10 years,” Cox said. “This group looks a lot more liberal on paper. You had six in 10 young men who are moderates vote for Trump, and more than one in five liberal young men vote for Trump…There’s something about Trump that was attractive and then there’s something about the Democratic Party, at least in its current manifestation, that was repellent.”\n\nExplanation No. 1: It’s bigger than America\n\nThere is no one explanation for these dynamics, but breaking out a few theories can help explain the situation.\n\nWe can start with structural, post-Covid explanations. The shift of young people to the right in general isn’t only happening in the United States, but all over the world. Something about this generation’s experiences, regardless of gender, is causing a rightward shift.\n\nThat shift mirrors the anti-establishment, anti-incumbency trend that democracies have been experiencing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic: frustration with the economic prospects; the squeeze of inflation and prices, and distrust in institutions, which in the US were represented by the Democratic Party. This theory would explain the dramatic shift in vote choices and partisan representation of young men over the last decade, and it is boosted by the fact that both young men and young women swung to Republicans last year — despite those swings being uneven.\n\nOutside of the US, it’s young voters who drove some of the surges of far-right and right-wing political parties across Europe in 2024. As the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson put it recently:\n\nIn France, Germany, Finland, and beyond, young voters are swinging their support toward anti-establishment far-right parties “in numbers equal to and even exceeding older voters.” In Germany, a 2024 survey of 2,000 people showed that young people have adopted a relatively new “gloomy outlook” on the future. No surprise, then, that the far-right Alternative für Deutschland has become the most popular party among Germans under 30. Like most interesting phenomena, this one even has a German name: Rechtsruck, or rightward shift.\n\nThompson points to political science research that has tracked a negative effect on trust in scientific authorities and political leaders as a result of pandemics and epidemics, particularly with those people between the ages of 18 and 25. Declining trust in American institutions — such as the Supreme Court, news media, the presidency, Congress, and big business — all make sense under this view.\n\nThe economics writer Kyla Scanlon argues something similar: that the youngest cohort of Gen Z faces a world of AI-driven disruption and institutional distrust and instability. They’re surrounded by echo chambers that feed their anxiety, and feel looser social connections. In response, they’re embracing more extreme, polarized identities and approaches to the economy and politics.\n\n“Many younger Gen Zers came of age watching political gridlock, rising inequality, and a system that seemed increasingly detached from their lived reality. They saw institutions that refused to adapt (and as of recently, have shown a lack of resilience). They were locked inside during their formative years,” she argues, and so view reality much differently than even the older range of Gen Z.\n\nIn the context of the 2024 election, this theory explains why young Democrats in particular were so down on Joe Biden, and eventually distrustful of Harris and the establishment she came to represent. My own conversations with youth Democratic activists during the election cycle and in its aftermath brought forth many of the same takeaways — that young Democrats found themselves talking to young people who were distrustful of the status quo, of incumbents, and of an older generation of politicians promising change.\n\nBut while these explanations do a solid job explaining the overall shift of Gen Z, they’re less strong on explaining the dramatic lurch right by young men specifically.\n\nExplanation No. 2: There’s something unique about Trump\n\nWhether it was the issues Trump talked about, the salience of those issues to young people, or his campaign strategy and appeal to traditional masculinity, these candidate-specific factors are more persuasive in explaining how a group that reads more liberal on paper could be willing to swing so drastically to the right.\n\nAs Cox of AEI told me, “They’re Trump Republicans, they’re not [traditional] Republicans.” They hold much more progressive views on a range of issues, and are much less aligned with the traditional Republican orthodoxy than standard conservatives, but were Trump-curious, or felt less stigma in being open to voting for him.\n\nMuch of that was due to the media and messaging apparatus Trump and his allies built over the last year, specifically to reach young men. Whether through specific advertising, social media and influencer outreach on YouTube and TikTok, podcast interviews, or other campaign events, Trump saturated the feeds and platforms that young people, especially men, love to consume.\n\nIt worked. Trump posted his strongest gains with groups of young voters who fall into two buckets: those who prioritized the economy and “low-propensity” voters. That second category can be further divided into youth who were least interested or engaged with political news and youth who were voting for the first time.\n\nThese aren’t hardcore conservative, reactionary, or ideological voters. They’re just “not dug in when it comes to politics,” Cox told me. “You look at where young women are on gun control and climate change and reproductive health and LGBTQ rights, and they prioritize these things. Young men are less likely to prioritize any of them. They support some amount of gun control, they’re more pro-choice than pro-life, but it’s not that central to their politics or political identity.”\n\nIn other words, the Trump pitch was persuasive enough to win over a group that might have been destined to break with a Democratic Party that was using the wrong message to try to hold onto their support. But this explanation is unique to Trump and his personal brand and doesn’t necessarily apply to the Republican Party in general or to other Republican politicians.\n\nExplanation No. 3: Democrats are doing something to turn off young men\n\nIf Trump was able to win over young men through his media presence and appeal to masculinity, it suggests Democrats failed to counter that influence — or even did something to make it worse.\n\nCox told me that beyond the specific candidates, there has been a general cultural drift of the Democratic Party’s identity, or perception, among young men that may be a missing piece. Beyond not being “masculine” enough or “too feminine,” there are cultural, class, and educational divides making it harder for the party to hang onto younger men — a party moving left faster than young men are.\n\n“If you look back to George W. Bush and his affect — he went to Yale, he was from an elite pedigree, but he leaned into the blue-collar identity, going out and scrubbing brush and clearing land in his Texas ranch,” Cox said. “This was true then, and it’s more true now, but in an era where people don’t trust slick-talking politicians, the idea of someone using their hands for a living, or pretending to do so, is really resonant. It’s not just a gender gap, but an education divide.”\n\nThis education polarization — of Democrats becoming more of a party of wealthier and better-educated white voters — applies not just to its base, but to its leadership as well. When the messengers, and staffers, running campaigns and formulating the pitches to young voters look less like the people they are trying to reach, “you have just fewer people who are immersed in culturally conversant in ways that can help you craft a winning and effective political message,” he said.\n\nThat cultural shift among Democrats, which includes the party’s embrace of identity politics and progressive social justice-speak, Cox has found, has led to some serious branding problems with young men on a small but influential set of beliefs, specifically affirmative action, LGBTQ, and DEI policies.\n\n“For young white men, their attitudes on various policies related to race are far more conservative than for young white women. There was a really significant divide in perceptions,” Cox said, about privilege and discrimination.\n\nHere, a theory from Vice President JD Vance might actually speak to something that goes beyond ideology or partisanship. Speaking at CPAC last week, Vance argued that “our culture sends a message to young men that you should suppress every masculine urge … don’t allow this broken culture to send you a message that you’re a bad person because you’re a man, because you like to tell a joke, because you like to have a beer with your friends, or because you’re competitive.”\n\nYoung men, especially young white men, over the last 10 years, have grown to feel like underdogs as Democrats and the national culture moved to prioritize marginalized groups or minority communities, the Gen Z writer and strategist Rachel Janfaza explained in the fall. “The left has increasingly focused on uplifting marginalized groups — especially women. But the unintentional consequence of this focus has left young men feeling like no one is speaking to them and that there is no home for them in the Democratic Party.”\n\nStepping into that void are conventional voices like Vance’s or radical ones, like the podcaster Andrew Tate. “Young men are seeing these content creators, podcasters, even politicians, telling them that society is cutting white men out of the picture, or even just all men. And they point to DEI initiatives as this form of wokeness,” Cameron Kasky, a former March for Our Lives gun control and progressive activist, told me. “They say this is an attack on men and white men, and we gotta fight back” by offering alternative models of masculinity that put economic and educational opportunities first.\n\nOn that front, part of the Democratic issue in 2024 might have been that it did not offer an effective alternative “masculinity,” a pro-social, community-focused pitch shared by a credible messenger, instead of mocking young “bros” as “mediocre” or denying that young men feel more isolated.\n\n“Multiple things can be true at once,” Gen Z Democratic strategist Annie Wu Henry told me about this relationship between progressive Democrats and young men last year. “We can acknowledge that white men have historically been the ones given the most privilege and power in society, while also not creating an environment where they feel completely alienated and then turn to spaces like the manosphere online — where they feel seen and accepted — but we also know lead to radicalization and validation of harmful viewpoints of other groups of people.”\n\nDemocrats did not offer an effective alternative “masculinity,” a pro-social, community-focused pitch shared by a credible messenger, instead of mocking young “bros” as “mediocre.”\n\nTo do that, Kasky says, “Democrats need to figure out how to get some swagger back,” and move beyond “Ivy League, fancy” communications.\n\nEven something as small as making a tonal shift will be important. Trump’s favorability among young men, though still higher than with young women, is beginning to trend down, suggesting that last year’s rightward shift might be moderating already.\n\nNone of this has to be permanent\n\nThe fundamental point these theories all make is that none of these attitudes, shifts, or realignments are ironclad — some were specific to the post-pandemic moment, some to the peculiarities of specific candidates, and some to cultural shifts that seem to have stalled. And while voters’ attitudes and perceptions of political parties tend to get ironed out in their youth, this moment of ideological and identitarian tumult might be different.\n\nImportantly for electoral politics and next year’s midterms, the 2024 results suggest that Trump benefited from a youth coalition that isn’t firmly Republican or consistently engaged in politics. The crossover support he received from young moderates and liberals, for example, might not come out to vote in a midterm election, or a non-Trump candidate. And many of their underlying beliefs are still liberal, or progressive on the issues.\n\n“These are not your traditional GOP voters, so whether they come up for a GOP governor or a Senate candidate is very much an open question,” Cox said. “The idea that these voters are not winnable in 2026 and 2028 is crazy. They absolutely are, and I don’t see JD Vance being particularly appealing to them. So the Democratic Party should really think hard about those kinds of voters and the voters that they lost to Trump in 2024.”",

        "content": "It won’t go down as the most exciting Oscars on record — there was no slap or envelope mix-up, after all — but for this year’s Academy Awards, ending an unexpectedly cacophonous awards season with a smooth, calamity-free ceremony clocking in at under four hours was arguably the best of all possible outcomes.\n\nThe big winner of the evening, Anora, scooped up five of its six nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress for Mikey Madison (sorry, Demi!). The Brutalist also flexed several wins, including one for actor-slash-gum-thrower Adrien Brody, while several more overtly political films, like Palestinian-Israeli documentary No Other Land and the anti-authoritarian Brazilian film I’m Still Here, picked up some trophies.\n\nOverall, the vibe was markedly upbeat — a series of solid comedy bits outshone politics, with amusing appearances from Adam Sandler, Bowen Yang, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and June Squibb. Inside the Dolby Theatre, the atmosphere was chill, the music was decent, most of the speeches were short (no thanks to Brody), and best of all? We weren’t stuck watching until well after midnight. Can we do it like this every year?\n\nStill, as always, not everyone came through the night unscathed, and some attendees went home happier than others. Check out our winners and losers below!\n\nWinner: Conan O’Brien kept things weird\n\nFrom his slightly too-gross entrance clawing his way out of Demi Moore’s back to his cheeky song-and-dance routine promising not to let the telecast go on too long, Conan O’Brien took the most thankless gig in show business this year and played it just a little weirder than you’d think he could. We, for one, are thankful.\n\nOver the course of his monologue, O’Brien affably roasted himself for not having had enough work done, Karla Sofía Gascón for her many offensive tweets, and Timothée Chalamet for his baby face. He also got in a truly delightful bit about showing John Lithgow’s disappointed face to anyone who took too long with their acceptance speech, plus another long shaggy-dog one with a belligerently be-hoodied Adam Sandler. (Sandler didn’t bother to put on a tux because he’s too good of a person to care about his clothes, he boasted.)\n\nMaking the Oscars funny is a feat in and of itself, but at the end of his monologue, O’Brien one-upped himself with a genuinely heartfelt tribute to what the Oscars mean in the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires. Award shows for wealthy celebrities can feel shallow after so much devastation, he acknowledged — but the Oscars also offer an incredible platform for the below-the-line talent that is not so famous. That the awards also lavished the nominees of the technical categories with the kind of praise they normally save for the actors? Well, that’s the icing on the cake. —Constance Grady\n\nConan O’Brien presenting at the Oscars. Getty Images\n\nLoser: Karla Sofía Gascón and bad publicists\n\nEarly on in awards season, trans actress Karla Sofía Gascón was hailed as a Best Actress frontrunner for her turn as the titular character in splashy musical Emilia Pérez. But things quickly spiraled for the film: Not only did audiences critique the storyline for regressive and inauthentic storytelling, but Gasćon drew negative attention for shading her fellow nominee Fernanda Torres — and then the real mine fields detonated: Twitter users dug up Gascón’s old tweets.\n\nIt turns out Gascón had a long history of making racist, Islamaphobic, antisemitic, homophobic, and other offensive comments, arguably culminating in her musing in public that Hitler “simply had his opinion about the Jews.” Though Gascón soon apologized and deleted her Twitter account, the scandal prompted many onlookers to wonder why on earth someone with such views had been cast to begin with, especially in a role that, for all the script’s flaws, was a groundbreaking trans character. At the very least, the question of why no one deleted her tweets before awards season should haunt Hollywood PR staff for years to come.\n\nThe Emilia Pérez production distanced itself hard from Gascón and threw itself into supporting its other nominated actress, Zoe Saldaña, who picked up a win for Best Supporting Actress. (Saldaña did not mention Gasćon in her acceptance speech, though she did thank the cast in general). The Academy Awards also seemed eager to distance itself from Gasćon during the ceremony; some preview clips of the film barely referenced her, and despite Emilia Perez being a musical, nominated for Best Picture in a heavily musical Oscars year, the cast was absent from the stage. Ultimately, the film, which originally led the pack with 13 nominations, picked up just two wins, and Gasćon went home empty-handed. —Aja Romano\n\nWinner: Non-Emilia Pérez musical numbers\n\nWhen it was announced that this year’s Oscars ceremony wouldn’t include performances of the Best Original Song nominees, it seemed like both a blessing and curse. This musical showcase has long been a crucial part of the ceremony, punctuating the awards and keeping audiences stimulated. However, this year’s list of nominees included two songs from Emilia Pérez, with songs that have been excessively mocked online. Nevertheless, one number, “El Mal,” took home Best Original Song. That was all the recognition the Academy seemingly wanted to give the film’s music during the ceremony, though, and it was ultimately a good choice.\n\nWicked stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande opened the show, with a celebration of the cinematic legacy of The Wizard of Oz and a tribute to Los Angeles following the catastrophic wildfires this past January. Grande performed “Somewhere Over The Rainbow” from The Wizard of Oz, while Cynthia Erivo sang “Home” from The Wiz, ending with her show-stopping “Defying Gravity” riff. Then there was a delightfully random James Bond tribute (perhaps a eulogy, given its recent Amazon acquisition?) featuring pop stars Lisa, Doja Cat, and Raye with a slightly shaky but amusing medley of “Skyfall,” “Diamonds Are Forever,” and “Live and Let Die.” Lastly, Queen Latifah offered a spirited tribute to Quincy Jones, performing “Ease on Down the Road” from his production The Wiz.\n\nThe Oscars seem to have taken notes from the Grammys, putting as many divas as they could onstage. In a ceremony defined by lackluster nominees, it was a welcome distraction. —Kyndall Cunningham\n\nAriana Grande performing at the Oscars. Getty Images\n\nWinner: Starting at 7 pm Eastern\n\nFor the second year in a row, Hollywood’s Biggest Night™ was actually late afternoon — the ceremony started at 4 pm Pacific/7 pm Eastern. And you know what? Good! For Academy Award watchers on the East Coast, the show going over means getting to bed closer to midnight. It’s a school night — not everyone can stay up that late.\n\nStarting an hour earlier also makes the viewing experience more pleasurable. The time cushion makes everything feel a little less stressful (especially when the acceptance speeches go long) because there’s essentially an extra hour. Host Conan O’Brien even had an entire musical number/a promise that he “won’t waste time.”\n\nPraise ABC and the powers that be, Sunday’s show ended before 11! —Alex Abad-Santos\n\nLoser: Actors talking about their private business in public\n\nBlame it on the vibe shift, blame it on the Los Angeles fires shaking up Hollywood, blame it on who knows what, but there was, frankly, a lot of people’s private business happening in front of the cameras on Hollywood’s biggest night. Kieran Culkin, accepting his Best Supporting Actor Oscar, told a long and admittedly funny story about his wife whose punchline was that she only agreed to have a third and a fourth child if he won an Emmy and an Oscar, respectively — because she didn’t think he ever would. Meanwhile, Andrew Garfield tried to make an unimpressed Goldie Hawn cry by telling her impromptu that she was his recently deceased mother’s favorite actor while they were supposed to be presenting the awards in the two animated categories.\n\nNone of this is necessarily bad, but it is traditionally the sort of thing you take care of when you are not being broadcast live across the world. Hollywood decided to tear down the boundaries tonight. —Constance Grady\n\nWinner: No Other Land\n\nThe winner for Best Documentary Feature — the result of a collaboration between Israeli and Palestinian activists — was something of an upset, if only because its lack of a US distributor hurt it at some Oscar-predicting awards, including both the Producers and Directors Guild Awards. The film’s creators are also its subjects: Basel Adra, a displaced Palestinian activist, navigates the destruction of the West Bank, while his friend and creative partner Yuval Abraham, an Israeli journalist, lives in relative security and stability.\n\nWhile the Oscars largely skirted political speech (no one referenced President Donald Trump by name), these directors succeeded in making an unusually direct address. In an uncompromising speech, Adra said, “We call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.” Abraham echoed this sentiment, saying, “We see each other, the destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end, the Israeli hostages, brutally taken in the crime of October 7, which must be freed,” before pointing directly to US foreign policy as blocking the path to peace. —Meredith Haggerty\n\nLoser: The revamped “Fab Five” presentation\n\nOne of the most beloved recurring features at the Oscars is what’s known as the “Fab Five” format in the acting categories. The gist: five previous winners of each category — Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress — are brought on stage to present and praise the nominees and announce the winner. It’s a touching way to honor the history and importance of the award.\n\nThe Fab Five was supposed to be used again this year but, likely due to the impossibly thorny optics of introducing Best Actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón and the controversy surrounding her Islamophobic and anti-Black tweets, the format was nixed. Instead, the Oscars consolidated. Three of last year’s winners — Robert Downey Jr., Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Cillian Murphy — said something about each of the nominees in their respective categories. Meanwhile, Emma Stone, who presented Best Actress, more or less just introduced the category and didn’t say anything specific about the actresses nominated, who besides Gascón included Demi Moore, Fernanda Torres, Cynthia Erivo, and winner Mikey Madison.\n\nThe result felt a little less personal and a bit more awkward. Downey Jr.’s casual glibness wasn’t a really good fit for giving other actors their moment in the sun, and there was no way for Stone to elegantly avoid the elephant in the room. Just one more way the Gascón blowup impacted the vibe at this year’s show. —Alex Abad-Santos",

        "title": "Three reasons why American democracy will likely withstand Trump",
        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a correspondent at Vox, where he covers the impacts of social and economic policies. He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nSince his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump has posed a serious threat to American democracy. From the start, he refused to commit to accepting election results. As president, he routinely undermined the rule of law. And he eventually tried to illegally hold on to power after losing the 2020 election, going so far as to incite a deadly insurrection that ultimately failed. Now, his recklessness is putting the country’s institutions through yet another dangerous stress test that has many critics worried about the long-term viability of American democracy and the risk of Trump successfully governing like a dictator.\n\nThese are certainly valid concerns. Trump’s first month in office has been a relentless assault on government: He is gutting the federal workforce, overtly handing over power to the world’s richest man, and even trying to redefine American citizenship altogether.\n\nTrump’s policies — from pursuing a plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza to launching a mass deportation campaign — are, and will continue to be, harmful. But for those looking for some glimmer of hope, it’s also true that it’s likely too early to be so pessimistic about the prospect of American democracy’s survival.\n\nThere are clear signs that American democracy might be able to withstand the authoritarian aspirations of this president. So if you’re looking for some silver linings, here are three reasons why American democracy is more resilient than you might think.\n\n1) The Constitution is extremely difficult to change\n\nWhen experts evaluate democratic backsliding in the US, they often compare it to other countries experiencing similar declines — places like Hungary, Turkey, or El Salvador. But one key factor that makes American democracy more resilient is that amending the Constitution of the United States is significantly more difficult.\n\nConstitutional reform to consolidate power is a critical step that often precedes democratic collapse. It gives aspiring autocrats a legal mechanism through which they can amass more and more control — something that is unlikely to happen in the United States. Because while Trump is testing the limits of executive power and challenging the courts to stop him, he doesn’t have the capacity or political support necessary to permanently change the Constitution.\n\nIn the US, any proposed constitutional amendment would need to be passed by two-thirds of Congress and ratified by three-quarters of the states. With the country divided relatively evenly between Democrats and Republicans — and power swinging back and forth between the two parties — it’s hard to see a party have enough of a majority to be able to do this without bipartisan support. Remember that even though Trump won the popular vote, he only won by 1.5 percentage points, hardly a mandate to change the Constitution.\n\nBy contrast, many other countries have fewer barriers to constitutional reform. In Turkey, for example, constitutional amendments are easier to pass because they can be put on the ballot in a national referendum if they first pass parliament with three-fifths of the vote.\n\n“When you look at the countries where democracy has broken down, the institutional framework in the United States is so much stronger and so much more entrenched,” said Kurt Weyland, a professor in government at the University of Texas at Austin who focuses on democratization and authoritarian rule. “In my book, I look at [dozens of] governments and I see that seven of those governments really pushed the country into competitive authoritarianism. In five of those cases very early on there was a fundamental transformation of the constitution.”\n\nIn Hungary, for example, Viktor Orbán became prime minister in 2010 with a supermajority in parliament that gave him the ability to amend the country’s constitution with ease. As a result, his government removed checks and balances and strengthened Orbán’s grip on the political system.\n\n“If you look at Orbán, he rewrote the constitution and so he rewrote the rules of elections, he rewrote the way the supreme court justices were chosen — the way the whole judiciary was run — and he rewrote the way elections were going to be organized. And so that way was able to control both the judicial branch and the legislative branch,” said Eva Bellin, a professor at Brandeis University’s politics department who focuses on democracy and authoritarianism. “That’s just not possible in America.”\n\nThe rigidity of the US Constitution is sometimes a frustrating feature of American democracy, essentially giving the judicial branch an almost-exclusive say in how the Constitution should evolve over time and limiting its ability to respond to the needs of modern society. But in times like these, the fact that it’s so difficult to pass a constitutional amendment is one of the principal safeguards against an authoritarian takeover of American institutions.\n\nOne of the core threats to democracy over the past decade has been Trump’s willingness to go to great lengths to win or maintain the presidency — a danger that materialized after he lost the 2020 election and tried to overturn the results, culminating in the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. When he was a candidate during Joe Biden’s presidency, there was the prospect of another January 6-style event given his violent rhetoric, constant undermining of the public’s faith in the electoral process, and the loyalist partisans in state and local positions who were willing to block the election results should Trump have lost in 2024.\n\nBut now that he won, Trump has no more campaigns to run, and because of that, the threat of Trump trying to manipulate the next election to stay in power is virtually gone. Though he has joked about serving a third term, short of a constitutional amendment — which, for the reasons outlined above, is almost certainly not in the cards — there is no legal avenue for him to do so. Under the 20th Amendment of the Constitution, Trump’s term will end at noon on January 20, 2029, at which point a new president will be sworn in.\n\n(Some might argue that the Supreme Court would favor Trump if he ever tries to challenge term limits, given how partisan the Court is. But that’s a highly unlikely scenario because of how clear the text of the 22nd Amendment is: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”)\n\nThe only way to circumvent the scheduled transition of power in 2029 will be for Trump to foment an actual coup. Of course, that’s what he tried to do four years ago, but next time, he would have even less going for him: He wouldn’t be eligible to run, so unlike in 2020, he can’t even claim that the election was rigged. Instead, he would have to convince America’s institutions to fully ignore not just one set of election results but the Constitution altogether.\n\nThe fact that Trump is term-limited also creates serious political hurdles for his ability to permanently reshape American democracy.\n\n“People are like, ‘Oh, Trump is more dangerous because he has learned, and he has loyalists, and he has flushed out a whole bunch of people who contained him in his first government,’” said Weyland. “But not only can he not be reelected, but he will be a lame duck, especially after the midterm elections. And virtually every midterm election, the incumbent president loses support in the House.”\n\nGiven Republicans’ narrow majority, Democrats have more than a decent shot at winning the House in 2026, which would be a major blow to Trump’s legislative agenda and bring much-needed oversight to the executive branch.\n\nThe other factor to consider is that Trump has no natural heir. Some Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have mimicked Trump’s style and seen success at the state level, but struggled to capture Trump’s base at the national level in the 2024 GOP primaries. That could change when Trump is out of the picture, but no one has emerged as the definitive leader of the post-Trump Republican Party.\n\n“One fundamental feature of these populist leaders is that they can’t have anybody [in charge] besides themselves,” Weyland said. So even if Democrats lose the House in 2026, as the 2028 presidential election gets underway and Republicans elect a new standard bearer, Trump’s hold on the GOP may not be as unbreakable as it has been since he became the party’s nominee in 2016. Even if the next GOP presidential nominee is a Trump loyalist — a likely scenario, to be sure — Trump will find himself having less direct influence over, say, members of Congress, who would be looking to their new candidate for guidance.\n\n3) Multiculturalism isn’t going away\n\nThe United States has not always been a multiracial democracy. But since the 1960s — and the passage of the Civil and Voting Rights Acts — the United States has been a stronger and much more inclusive democracy than it has been for most of its history. That doesn’t mean that there hasn’t been backlash. To the contrary, gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics have long aimed to diminish the power of Black voters: In 1980, for example, only 5.8 percent of Black voters in Florida were deprived of the right to vote because of a felony conviction, but by 2016, that number was closer to 20 percent.\n\nStill, the path to victory for candidates at the national level requires some effort to build a multiracial coalition. Even though white Americans make up a majority of the electorate, Republicans have to reckon with the fact that some 40 percent of white voters are either Democrat or lean Democrat, which means that they do need at least some Black and Latino voters to win.\n\nSo while it is concerning that Trump has made gains with Black and brown voters since his first election win, especially given the overt racism of his campaigns, there’s also a positive twist: Trump’s improvement with nonwhite voters shows Republicans that the party doesn’t have to abandon democracy to stay in power.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have long been locked out of winning the popular vote. Between 1992 and 2020, Republicans lost the popular vote 7 out of 8 times. The lack of popular support gave the GOP two options: respect the rules of democracy and continue losing unless they change course, or make power grabs through minority rule. The party chose the latter, using Republican-led state legislatures and the Supreme Court to enact voter suppression laws.\n\nBut Trump’s ability to appeal to more Black and Latino voters resulted in Trump being the first Republican to win the popular vote in 20 years. That fact could change Republicans’ calculus when it comes to how they choose to participate in democracy. Trump, in other words, made it clear that they can win by appealing to more Black and brown voters, which means that they have an incentive to actually cater to the electorate rather than reject it and find paths to power without it, as they have previously tried.\n\n“While [gains with Black and Latino voters] enabled Trump to win, I think in the broader sense it’s a good thing for American democracy because it precisely gets them out of that corner of thinking” they’re destined to be an eternal minority, Weyland said. “So that pulls them out of that demographic cul-de-sac and gives them a more democratic option for electoral competition.”\n\nUltimately, Trump’s improved margins with Black and brown voters is bad for Democrats and their supporters, but the fact that Republicans have diversified their coalition is a good step toward preserving America’s multiracial democracy.\n\nAmerican democracy is elastic, not fragile\n\nAmerican democracy has never been perfect. Even before Trump rose to power, presidents have pushed and pulled institutions and expanded the executive branch’s authority. There have also been other instances where American democracy has been seriously challenged.\n\nIn 2000, for example, the presidential election was not decided by making sure that every single vote was counted. Instead, the Supreme Court intervened and along partisan lines stopped vote recounts in Florida, which ultimately handed the presidency to George W. Bush. “Preventing the recount from being completed will inevitably cast a cloud on the legitimacy of the election,” Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the dissent.\n\nThat case, like many other moments in this nation’s history, shows that American democracy can bend — that it can stretch and contract — but that its core principles tend to survive even in the aftermath of antidemocratic assaults. The wealthiest Americans, for example, have been amassing more and more political power, making it harder than ever to have an equal playing field in elections. But we still have elections, and while grassroots organizers have an unfair disadvantage, they also have the ability to exert their influence in spite of deep-pocketed donors.\n\nThe roots of American democracy aren’t fickle. They’re deep enough to, so far, withstand the kind of democratic backsliding that has led other countries to authoritarianism.\n\nStill, the imbalance of power between the wealthy and the rest of society is a sign of democratic erosion — something that has only escalated since Trump gave Elon Musk, who spent hundreds of millions of dollars supporting Republicans in the last election, the ability to overtly influence the White House’s decision-making. Moves like that show why the second Trump presidency remains a threat to democracy.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "After one of the strangest and most controversial Oscar races in recent memory, a polarizing movie, warranting tons of strong opinions online, inevitably rose to the top. The Sean Baker film Anora won five of its six nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Actress for Mikey Madison.\n\nIt’s been a weird road to Oscars glory for the critically lauded movie, which won the prestigious Palme d’Or at last year’s Cannes Film Festival. The comedy-drama, about a strip club dancer whose fairytale marriage to the son of a Russian oligarch suddenly goes haywire, generated early buzz but took a backseat for much of awards season, losing screenwriting and direction awards to films like Conclave and The Brutalist. The movie shockingly left the Golden Globes empty-handed.\n\nWhile the film experienced a bit of a lopsided awards season, it had a steady presence online as one of the most discoursed movies of the past year — second only to two-Oscar winner Emilia Pérez. While the movie impressed most critics and clearly the Academy, Anora has been a lightning rod on film-interested corners of X, Letterboxd, and among sex workers and even the movie’s own army of stans.\n\nFirst, there was the revelation from Madison that she didn’t use an intimacy coordinator for the film’s sex scenes after being given the option by Baker. It quickly raised questions about Baker as a professional and his relationship to actor protections that have become standard in the wake of Me Too. In fact, much of the conversation surrounding the movie has been centered on Baker, whose politics and intentions as an auteur have often been hard to map.\n\nFollowing the celebrated release of his third film Tangerine in 2015, about a pair of Black, trans sex workers, his low-budget filmography has been exclusively dedicated to portraying sex workers, in what he’s repeatedly described as an effort to “remove the stigma” from the industry and offer an unrepresented class visibility. While accepting the Palme d’or for Anora, he dedicated the award to “sex workers past, present and future.” And in his acceptance speech for Best Original Screenplay, he dutifully thanked the sex worker community.\n\nThe cast and filmmakers of Anora posing with the Palme d’Or Award during the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. Stephane Cardinale/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nStill, questions about Baker’s relationship to depicting sex work loom larger than ever, particularly with his latest work Anora, with some in the profession logging thoughtful essays about their concerns with Baker’s work. Why does his treatment of these characters, specifically women, feel so regressive? For someone who’s mined stories from the same marginalized profession over and over again, why has he been unable to come up with anything other than reductive stereotypes?\n\nAnora has been marketed as “a love story from Sean Baker.” Yet it might be his film that’s most lacking in sentimentality and tenderness for his characters (a Baker hallmark, even if it often comes out in the form of pity). The movie follows a 23-year-old stripper named Ani (Madison) who elopes with the son of a rich Russian family named Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn) after meeting him at her club. Her rags-to-riches romance comes to an abrupt and jarring end when several henchmen show up to Vanya’s Brighton Beach mansion, under his family’s direction, demanding that their marriage be annulled. Vanya flees the scene, leaving Ani alone to fight off the henchmen who inevitably abduct her and bring her along on their search for Vanya.\n\nThis drawn-out set piece and all of its violence — Ani screaming as she’s being bound and bent over on a couch, Ani screaming “rape!” as a cry for help — is played for laughs and unsettling to watch. In a review for Angel Food Magazine, Marla Cruz illustrates how this sequence undermines the commonplace violence that sex workers are vulnerable to: “Crystallized by the moment she repetitively yells “rape!” to the goons’ bewilderment, Ani’s fear is sublimated into feminine histrionics. The camera cuts to a close up of her screaming mouth, encouraging the audience to identify with the men in their mission to get this unruly woman under control by gagging her with a red scarf.”\n\nRelated 4 winners and 3 losers from a madcap Oscars\n\nBaker’s direction never really sympathizes with Ani or even acknowledges the level of physical and emotional violation she’s experiencing throughout the film, constantly undercutting it with anti-PC comedy, or, in more frustrating moments, positioning her as a problem to a group of men who are “just trying to do their jobs.” Viewers are encouraged to gawk, laugh, and essentially normalize her subjugation.\n\nAni is dragged around, humiliated, and stripped of all control until she has an emotional breakdown at the end of the film — while she’s mounting a man. Through this lens, the entire movie is just another reductive if not moralistic tale of a sex worker’s suffering. A consistent flaw in Baker’s work (with the exception of 2021 film Red Rocket) is that while his movies illustrate their characters’ economic positioning in arguably amusing and sometimes compelling ways, they lack a sharp point of view. In the same vein, his characters often want for interiority, using naturalistic dialogue to cover up a shallow characterization. Despite the movie being titled Anora, audiences don’t leave knowing much about her — her desires, her fears, her family, her past. We only know what’s done to her.\n\nMikey Madison and Mark Eydelshteyn in Anora. Neon\n\nAnora is heavily influenced by films of the ’70s, bringing to mind Jane Fonda’s iconic call girl from the 1971 film Klute, as a point of comparison. Fonda’s character serves as a reminder of the self-determination and agency sex workers can have in film, while still reckoning with the real threats of danger they live under. When Baker attempts to depict Ani as strong-willed, it’s largely in moments where she comes off as offensive, immature, and a class traitor.\n\nYet, in situations involving money, where she should presumably execute the most authority and cleverness, she’s markedly passive and naive. She remains quiet watching Vanya accrue gambling losses at a casino. When he proposes to her, she sassily demands an engagement ring that has “at least three karats,” when he could afford much more. Most shocking, she demands only $15,000 to be Vanya’s “horny American girlfriend” for a week. After shaking on the offer, Vanya tells her that she should’ve asked for more. She still doesn’t.\n\nUltimately, Anora may fall into the category of Oscar-winning movies that seem like a cool, progressive choice on paper, but are ridden with problems and critiques from the communities they purport to represent.\n\nThere are other factors that have presumably lent to this win, too. Baker is one of the few modern auteurs who’s been unwavering in his commitment to making independent cinema for over 20 years now. Anora is also a monument to ’70s filmmaking canon, an era of cinema that Hollywood has heralded as an emblem of taste. With Anora, Baker puts himself in the conversation with celebrated auteurs like John Cassavetes, Martin Scorsese, and Robert Altman. If only his work contained some of that era’s more radical politics and subversive representations.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "When was the last time you felt utterly, stupefyingly, mind-numbingly bored? It might’ve been when you languished in the waiting room at a doctor’s office for 10 minutes too long. Or you felt your eyes glaze over in the middle of a philosophy class. Perhaps it was on a never-ending drive wherein your toddler insisted on hearing the same song over and over and over again. Maybe you are exceedingly bored right now (in which case, I’m sorry, and I hope to recapture your attention).\n\nBoredom is a common occurrence in the ebb and flow of life. It’s usually marked by a feeling of restlessness and agitation, says James Danckert, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Waterloo and the co-author of Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom. A hunch that you must get out of here immediately.\n\nRelated How to be alone with your thoughts\n\nThere is a functional aspect to boredom, though. The emotion is motivating, meant to spur you to action: This thing you’re doing is not fulfilling or meaningful, so go find something else that is. Some are better at listening to that alarm than others, Danckert says, and those who say they never get bored are probably more skilled at dealing with it. Those who respond productively to the messages boredom sends have the power to make changes in their lives, big and small, which is great for you and bad for boredom. “Boredom doesn’t do the hard work of telling you what to do,” Danckert says. “It just tells you you need to do something else.” It’s up to you to figure out what that is.\n\nA desire for something different\n\nWhile you’ve surely experienced boredom at some point or another, have you stopped to consider why? Erin Westgate, an assistant professor of social psychology at the University of Florida who studies boredom, defines the feeling as one in which we don’t want to or can’t engage with what we’re doing, either because we lack the attention to do it — because the task is too easy or too difficult — or it lacks meaning. Boredom can strike momentarily — the impossibility of focusing while reading a dense book, for instance — or it can take root over a longer period of time, such as when you find yourself working an unfulfilling job.\n\n“Boredom doesn’t do the hard work of telling you what to do. It just tells you you need to do something else.”\n\nBoredom can be fairly universal: Few find waiting in line at the DMV a particularly riveting experience. But it is individual, too. A movie you consider engrossing may be a snooze to another viewer. This is why some people find being alone with their thoughts excruciating, while others revel in mind wandering, Westgate says. Sitting with your inner monologue absent other distractions is not equivalent to being bored, at least not for everyone. However, it can be boring if you don’t particularly enjoy solitude.\n\nAnother common misconception: “People often conflate boredom with not having anything to do,” Westgate says. On the contrary, if your day consists of monotonous, repetitive tasks, you may not have much downtime but feel bored. The uber-busy who claim to crave boredom may in fact be yearning for quiet contendedness, a moment to relax.\n\nIt’s true that filling your days with constant activities and entertainment may prevent you from getting bored in the first place. While this doesn’t necessarily seem like a bad thing, if you’re constantly masking boredom with another podcast or just one more episode, “you are preventing yourself from knowing when you’ve gone off track from what you value and what you care about and what you can give to the world,” Westgate says.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

Those who see being bored as an impediment and frustration tend to be bored more often, says Wijnand Van Tilburg, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Essex. On the contrary, those who see boredom as an inevitability of life get less bored and, when they do, cope with it more effectively.\n\nAnd despite anecdotal evidence that says otherwise, boredom doesn’t lead to inspired breakthroughs and increased creativity, research shows. Instead, it’s the moderately engaging activities, like showering or taking a walk, that actually lead to inspiration. The shower or the walk is neither so engrossing or boring as to distract your thoughts from churning — that’s the sweet spot you should be aiming for.\n\nMaking the most of boredom\n\nSo how can you better deal with boredom when it strikes? How can you adequately decode what your boredom is signaling?\n\nWhen the feeling does arise, use it as a reminder that what you’re doing isn’t meaningful and to seek out something that is, experts say. This will differ depending on the context. You might pop in a podcast while folding laundry to help make the chore feel less like drudgery. Perhaps you could head to YouTube to find a bread-making tutorial on a dreary afternoon. “It doesn’t really matter what it is,” Danckert says, “but you have to deem it to be valid and worth doing.”\n\nFor circumstances where you’re unable to up and leave, such as school or work, Westgate suggests trying to make the experience more profound. “Focus on why am I here and what’s the deeper purpose it’s serving so that the experience feels more meaningful,” she says.\n\nDespite anecdotal evidence to the contrary, boredom doesn’t lead to inspired breakthroughs and increased creativity.\n\nOr maybe you’re growing impatient on a long road trip: Try to find challenges or ways to make the situation more stimulating. Car games exist for a reason. Or make up your own. “My brother and I, growing up, used to play this game called ‘Who would you ask for help?’” Westgate says. “In this room right now, if you had to pick one person to ask for help, who would it be and why?”\n\nOf course, the solution to a soul-crushingly boring job might be to find another one that gives your life more meaning and purpose. Since this isn’t exactly easy or realistic for many people, Danckert suggests reframing your current employment situation: You’re not living to work, you’re working to live. That is, your job gives you money which allows you to do meaningful activities in your free time.\n\nFor more short-term boredom, like waiting in line for a sandwich, Westgate says there’s nothing wrong with using your phone as entertainment to pass the time. “If looking at your phone is a form of distraction for a few minutes, that lets you stick with that boring, uncomfortable activity that you still need to do, that’s probably fine,” she says. “I think the problem becomes when that is our response to all boredom.”\n\nIf you’re using your phone as a crutch every time you feel the slightest whisper of boredom, you may develop some unhealthy habits — like scrolling on the sidelines at your kid’s soccer game or while driving. In fact, constantly scrolling through short videos, like on TikTok, increases boredom, a study found. “It reduces attention capacity, it reduces perceptions of meaning in one’s activity,” Van Tilburg says. It “increases boredom, even though people think that doing so will help alleviate it.”\n\nInstead of using your devices as a boredom security blanket, Van Tilburg suggests getting more comfortable breaking it up in myriad, tangible ways, like striking up a conversation while in line for coffee or creating phone-free areas at home (like the bedroom and bathroom). Try to embrace mind wandering instead of fearing silence.\n\nBoredom is a lot like goldilocks: You shouldn’t avoid it completely, but too much of it isn’t good either. Life doesn’t need to be a monotonous fog, nor is it supposed to be perpetually rapturously engaging.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent and editor for Vox’s Future Perfect, covering global health. He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., US secretary of Health and Human Services, countered sharp criticisms from Democratic senators over his past questioning of vaccine safety by saying he would not stop anyone from getting polio and measles vaccines. Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn early February, Texas health officials reported that measles was spreading among an insular religious community in Gaines County, Texas, where nearly 14 percent of schoolchildren have an exemption (granted in some states for reasons of conscience, including for religious beliefs) from the required childhood vaccinations. The disease has since been detected in a bordering New Mexico county. And last week, the case count grew to at least 146 people. Last year, the US saw 285 measles cases nationwide — the fourth-highest total since 2000.\n\nThe outbreak escalated just as the US’s foremost vaccine skeptic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., ascended as its top health care official. On February 26, the Texas health department reported the first death in the outbreak, an unvaccinated school-aged child.\n\nKennedy is no longer an outside agitator but the government official ultimately responsible for squashing public health threats in the US. The outbreak will be the first big test case for how he will lead the US health department during an active public health emergency.\n\nAfter stating on February 26 that a measles outbreak was “not unusual,” Kennedy has expressed new urgency about the first major public health crisis on his watch. The rapidly expanding outbreak was “a call to action,” he wrote in a March 2 Fox News op-ed.\n\nWhile writing that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” Kennedy simultaneously urged parents to speak with their health care provider about the measles vaccine.\n\n“Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” he wrote. Local officials have reported that some Texas families are getting vaccinated in the wake of the outbreak.\n\nThis is an outbreak that, on its own, has accounted for more cases than the US sometimes sees in an entire year. Twenty-five years after the US declared the disease eradicated, measles is making a comeback.\n\nHow would the response to an outbreak normally look?\n\nWhen there is a disease outbreak that requires government action (i.e., not your standard sniffles), local governments are the first responders. County officials are typically the first to receive reports of a disease spreading and they will start ramping up testing and other kinds of surveillance to assess the situation.\n\nThat was what happened in Texas; one Gaines County school district reported the first measles to their local community in late January. Within a week, the Texas state government stepped up once the outbreak had climbed to six cases, and began providing support for the local response. That’s also typical: While local authorities are on the front line, the state provides technical expertise, they may offer funding for communication and interventions (such as vaccine drive-throughs), and they otherwise serve as the top authority on how the response should be handled.\n\nThe feds usually stay in the background with an outbreak the size of the current measles occurrence. They can offer expert or laboratory support, for example. But otherwise, they are supporting players, unless the outbreak poses a unique threat to the rest of the nation or becomes a large multi-state crisis. For now, the current outbreak is limited to a small geographical region, and the states appear well aligned on how to respond.\n\nBut it is possible that further spread could demand federal officials get more involved — a development that would be worth watching closely, given its new leadership.\n\nThe good news: So far, RFK Jr.’s HHS isn’t complicating the response.\n\nThe outbreak was already underway before Kennedy was confirmed and, though it’s easy to forget after the pandemic, local authorities are taking the lead as they should. Texas health officials — and their counterparts in New Mexico, now that cases have begun to spread there — have set up mobile vaccination and testing sites, encouraging unvaccinated people to get their shots now. Because local officials are among the community they serve, they may be considered more trustworthy (and in turn they can ultimately be more effective).\n\nIf those efforts are allowed to continue unencumbered, that will be a hopeful sign that the RFK Jr.-led health department will not actively sabotage public health efforts when there is an acute crisis underway. After some observers pointed out that the CDC measles tracker had not been updated with the new outbreak, the web page was refreshed on Friday with a pledge to continue updating it every Friday.\n\nSo far, there is no sign that local officials have requested support from the federal government and been denied it.\n\nShould I be worried about measles spreading more widely?\n\nNot exactly. Such outbreaks are still relatively rare and, when they do occur, they usually stay localized. But America is trending in the wrong direction when it comes to this ancient disease, which can cause painful skin rashes and be deadly for young unvaccinated children.\n\nThe US declared measles eliminated in 2000. But it has regained a foothold as vaccination rates have dropped. In 2019, there was the largest outbreak in decades when more than 1,200 people became ill, mostly in New York. Now more than 120 individuals are sick along the border of Texas and New Mexico — larger than any outbreak last year and it is still only February.\n\nNationally, the measles vaccination rate has slipped just below the 95 percent target that experts say is necessary to maintain population-level immunity. In some states, the situation is more dire: 14 states had vaccination rates below 90 percent for the 2023–2024 school year, per the health policy think tank KFF.\n\nBut in individual communities, rates can slip even lower, creating the right conditions for an outbreak to explode; measles, after all, is one of the most contagious diseases known to man. In the Gaines County school district most affected by the outbreak, the vaccination rate is under 50 percent.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans still believe the measles vaccine is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. But as our collective faith in science deteriorates, vaccination rates are also declining.",

Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\n\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\n\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\n\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!",

But, for the moment, the Trump administration is not openly defying any of the orders against it.\n\nThis tenuous moment could escalate into a full-blown constitutional crisis at any moment, however. And it could get there in one of two ways.\n\nThe first is if Trump actually did openly defy a court order insisting that he must comply with the Constitution. If that were to occur, the only lawful mechanism remaining to control his behavior would be impeachment. And, when you consider the fact that the Senate couldn’t find the required 67 votes to disqualify him from office in 2021 after he incited a mob to attack the US Capitol, a successful impeachment seems highly unlikely.\n\nThe second possibility is even worse: if the courts, and, especially, the Supreme Court, choose to be complicit in Trump’s attacks on the Constitution.\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 Republican supermajority, deciding to cast its lot with the leader of the Republican Party. Just last July, the Republican justices ruled that Trump is immune from prosecution for nearly all crimes he commits using his official powers as president.\n\nWorse, much of that opinion argued that Trump cannot face consequences even if he orders the Justice Department to target his political rivals. So the Republican justices have already preemptively given Trump permission to use state power in a manner that’s inconsistent with the rule of law.\n\nIf the justices were to uphold some of Trump’s unconstitutional actions, such as his attack on birthright citizenship or his attempt to “impound” federal funds he does not want to spend, that would grant a patina of legitimacy to those actions. And it would likely give Trump’s allies in Congress another excuse to continue backing the president.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump or his fellow Republicans on the Supreme Court will decide to trigger the kind of crisis that would result if he openly defies the courts, or if the courts decide to place loyalty to the Republican Party over loyalty to the Constitution. For the moment, all we can do is wait and see if that crisis arrives.",

        "content": "is a policy correspondent for Vox covering social policy. She focuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights, and has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.\n\nAmerica’s fragile child care system relies heavily on immigrant workers. Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown could cripple it.\n\nSince 2011, federal guidance has advised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents against conducting enforcement in “sensitive locations” like hospitals, churches, schools and day care centers. On his first day back in office, Trump removed these longstanding protections, marking a major change from his first term as president. Now — with ICE officials charged with increasing their daily arrests from a few hundred people to upward of 1,500, and top immigration agents demoted for not deporting people fast enough — day care centers stand as direct targets.\n\nThe crackdown on immigrants threatens to upend an industry where foreign-born staff make up one-fifth of the workforce nationally — and nearly half in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and San Jose, California. Research led by the New American Economy think tank estimated that over 200,000 undocumented immigrants work in child care and day care services. The new, harsher enforcement comes at a particularly precarious time, as major employers phase out remote work policies, leaving parents with an intensifying scramble for child care.\n\nChild care programs already have an employee turnover rate 65 percent higher than average. The pay helps explain why: As of 2023, the median hourly wage for full-time, year-round child care workers was just $14.60, and the field ranked as the 10th lowest-paid occupation out of nearly 750 jobs across the economy, according to one analysis. The Trump crackdown could make everything even worse.\n\nJessica Brown, an economist at the University of South Carolina, has studied how earlier bouts of immigration enforcement affected child care markets. Her analysis of the Secure Communities program, which operated nationwide from 2008 to 2014, found that even when immigration enforcement primarily targeted men, it still disrupted female-dominated child care. The program decreased the overall supply of child care workers and centers and reduced enrollment overall.\n\nDespite claims that immigrants are taking jobs from native-born Americans, when immigrant workers left the child care industry, native-born workers didn’t fill the gap. Instead, the number of native-born child care workers also decreased — as costs went up and centers closed.\n\nToday’s situation could prove even more disruptive.\n\n“The current raids represent a much more salient threat of deportation for women,” said Brown, who anticipates a larger impact on child care markets compared to Secure Communities, at least in the short-term. “The long-term effect depends on whether this becomes the new normal. More importantly, it’s about perception — even if the raids decrease, once fear takes hold in immigrant communities, the chilling effects could linger.” Among those most vulnerable to such fear are the children themselves.\n\nThe cascading effects of immigration enforcement\n\nThese chilling effects aren’t theoretical. The first Trump term provides insight into the impacts these raids could have on both kids and child care providers. Back in 2017, the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), a national anti-poverty organization, launched a multistate study on how Trump’s immigration policies were affecting children under age 8. In interviews with staff and families across six states, researchers found that children as young as three were showing signs of trauma from fears about enforcement.\n\nEarly childhood educators reported disturbing new behaviors — increased aggression, separation anxiety, and withdrawal — that they described as distinct from children’s behaviors in past years. One preschool director in Georgia described a 5-year-old child whose anxiety was so severe that he was biting his fingertips until they bled.\n\nThe study found widespread drops in day care attendance and enrollment as families isolated themselves. Programs reported parents leaving young children with older siblings or grandparents instead of in formal care, minimizing time outside the home to avoid law enforcement encounters. With enrollment declines cutting into already-thin margins and state subsidies often tied to attendance, these shifts threatened the financial viability of centers that entire neighborhoods depend on.\n\nThe crisis extended beyond the direct provision of child care. Providers and parents reported increased reluctance to access public benefits like health insurance and nutrition assistance due to worries that Medicaid or SNAP information could be shared with immigration officials.\n\nRelated Fixing the child care crisis starts with understanding it\n\nEarly childhood staff themselves reported intense anxiety about increased incidents of racism and xenophobia affecting the families they serve and, in some cases, themselves personally. Many providers described the emotional burden of being asked by parents to become emergency guardians for their children in case they were deported.\n\nWendy Cervantes, the director of Immigration and Immigrant Families at CLASP who co-led the research, told Vox that the difficulty of finding child care providers who have the right skills to educate dual-language children is often overlooked. “There are not a lot of people who have the training and are also bilingual who are competent,” she said.\n\nHow policymakers, advocates, and child care directors are trying to protect families and staff\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, many child care providers didn’t even know their centers were protected under the “sensitive locations” federal guidance, leading advocates to launch national campaigns to raise awareness about these safeguards. Now, however, those same advocates are working to help providers understand that guidance is no longer in effect, but that they still have constitutional rights.\n\n“They still have rights under the Fourth Amendment to restrict the extent to which ICE can enter,” Cervantes said. Immigration agents still need signed judicial warrants with a specific person’s name and address to raid a private space. To help providers navigate these changes, CLASP is coordinating resources and planned a national webinar at the end of February for child care programs specifically.\n\nThe political crusade against immigration may score political points, but on the ground, it’s setting up a chain reaction that could cascade through the entire economy.\n\nMany child care centers are also developing new protocols to operate in this environment. Some are removing outdoor signage to avoid ICE attention and developing new systems to communicate warnings to parents. Others are rethinking their data collection policies, to limit questions that ask about families’ immigration status.\n\n“There’s a difference between finding out something and documenting,” said Atenas Burrola Estrada, an attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. She emphasized the importance of child care centers making plans ahead of time so that staff know what they need to do if ICE enforcement comes.\n\n“What can be different about child care is the fear-factor, and it can be much more traumatizing for a small child,” she said. “Providers also need to know who to call if mom and dad don’t come home, so they can avoid children ending up in state custody.”\n\nSome states are hoping to create new protections through legislation. In California, a bill would make it harder for ICE agents to enter schools or child care centers. And even if agents met the requirements for entry, they’d still only be able to enter areas where children aren’t present.\n\nIn Congress, Democrats Rep. Adriano Espaillat and Sen. Richard Blumenthal recently reintroduced a bill to codify the “sensitive locations” federal guidance. But the legislation is a long shot: It failed to pass in 2017, and today’s political landscape has shifted so that even many Democrats now support tougher immigration enforcement amid growing concern about border security. Earlier this year, Congress passed the Laken Riley Act, requiring mandatory detention for immigrants accused of theft and related crimes – exactly the type of broad enforcement that advocates fear could sweep up child care workers.\n\nAs politicians wage war on immigration in the name of protecting American jobs, their policies threaten to unravel the very system that keeps millions of Americans — especially mothers — in the workforce. In classrooms across the country, children form bonds with care workers who help shape their earliest years, and immigrant teachers create the bilingual, multicultural spaces that define modern American childhood. The political crusade against immigration may score political points, but on the ground, it’s setting up a chain reaction that could cascade through the entire economy — from parents forced to cut back work hours to businesses losing productive employees to a generation of children without supportive care at their most formative age.\n\n\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Bainum Family Foundation.

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "In a Cold War-era bunker-turned-Airbnb situated 50 feet below ground in Arkansas, journalist Lynne Peeples conducted an experiment to better understand her internal clock. She’d always struggled with sleep — growing up in Seattle, the long, dark winters contributed to the effects of seasonal affective disorder (or SAD). From an early age, she says, she understood her circadian rhythms — the body’s measure of time that drives everything from the sleep-wake cycle to appetite — were generally disrupted.\n\nFor 10 days, she cordoned herself off from all of the signals the body uses to tell time. She deprived herself of light, from both the sun and electricity, clocks, most screens and other people. (Peeples did have some light: She set all the LED lights in the Airbnb to a dim red light, which wouldn’t impact her circadian rhythms.) She strapped herself up to devices that tracked her temperature, glucose levels, sleep, and heart rate and tried to live as normally as possible. To pass the time, she juggled, played the harmonica, and read on a Kindle. She documented her experience on a typewriter.\n\nAbout halfway through, her internal clocks had completely flipped. Her stomach was “distant and grumbly,” her chest heavy, and she had a general weak and woozy feeling. Unbeknownst to her, when everyone above ground was sleeping, she was wide awake. Later, while combing through her biometric data with scientists, she discovered her rhythms had fallen out of sync with one another. “I could feel it,” Peeples says. “I was feeling all the symptoms of sleepiness throughout the day, hot and cold at odd times, a little bit of depression. I’m not thinking clearly. My gut was a disaster. All those things happened about the same time.”\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

Here, Peeples shares what she’s learned and how you can better calibrate your own circadian rhythms.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nWere there any surprising takeaways from your experiment in the bunker?\n\nThese inner clocks we have in our bodies are not precision timekeepers. That’s why we need these regular recalibration opportunities with the light-dark cycle of our planet. But they are pretty good clocks. The first couple days, I was living pretty close to a 24-hour day without having any idea what the actual time was. I would occasionally make a guess at the time for fun, and a day-and-a-half in, I was only off by 11 minutes.\n\nSo why is light so important to our internal clocks?\n\nWe evolved outdoors. The sun, during the day, shines a full spectrum of light, and it’s centered around the blue wavelengths. We evolved these cells in the back of our eyes, these photoreceptors, that perceive that blue light and send signals to our master clock in our brain that says, I see this strong blue light. It must be daytime. That’s how we evolved to tell day from night.\n\nIn today’s society, a lot of us in the modern world, we’re hidden from both bright days and dark nights.\n\nIn today’s society, a lot of us in the modern world, we’re hidden from both bright days and dark nights. We’re losing that contrast that we evolved with. Not only do we have this relatively dim light during the day, but we also have basically that same light indoors at night too, when we’re sitting under light. It’s really about that contrast that our clocks evolved to use to differentiate day and night.\n\nShould we be trying to get more of that contrast? So, making it dim in our houses when the sun goes down and trying to get bright light during the daytime?\n\nI would say yes. This is what I’m trying to do. Especially in the morning, if you can get outside for 15, 20 minutes of actual daylight, that really helps recalibrate your clocks and keep them synced to the 24-hour day. During the day, get outside for little bits, even if it’s cloudy out, and inside, try to be close to a window.\n\nThen at night, dim the lights. Try to use warmer hues of light. The oranger, the redder the better. In my apartment now at night, I turn off all overhead lights. I’m only using table lamps and electric candles that I have around my apartment. As you get into later evening, if you’re going to bed, try to cut out absolutely every light. If you have to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, do not slip on the bathroom lights. A warm night light or carrying a candle is the best plan.\n\nI often hear the advice of getting light in the morning. Can SAD lamps effectively mimic that light?\n\nIf you have the option to get outside, that is still the best because you can get out for a walk and that’s good for you. But if you don’t have that option and it’s the dead of winter anywhere at a high latitude and there’s not even the sun up in the morning, then SAD lamps definitely have their place.\n\nOn the flip side, how concerned should we be about blue light from our electronics?\n\nTo some degree, certain things can be overblown. The overhead lights in your apartment are probably having a bigger impact on you, especially compared to a TV. Because at that distance, that blue light coming from the TV is probably minimal if you’re not right up against it. If you have an iPhone, if you dim it, it’s not probably producing that much harmful light. The consensus among scientists is that blue light can have an impact on our sleep, on our rhythms. The extent of that impact is still up for debate. It can’t hurt to try to limit that, but to a point. You don’t want to cut out all your pleasure in your life. If you’re watching something that’s calming, that helps turn down your brain a little bit to help you sleep at night, the benefits may outweigh the risks.\n\nAre there “ideal” times of day to be doing certain tasks based on our circadian rhythms, like exercise in the afternoon, or thinking hard in the morning?\n\nThere are certain times a day, depending on your personal chronotype or how your circadian rhythms run, when you are going to be at your best for thinking, for solving a problem, for running faster, for lifting more weight, for being creative. On average, the science suggests that late morning hours are usually the best as far as your alertness. For me, I do fall into that category. Since I’ve learned that, I do try to use those hours to tackle my more challenging mental tasks. Then as far as physical performance, on average, most of us are at our best in the late afternoon or early evening. That’s when most world records are broken for swimming, for example. It is personal, so you have to get a sense of your own rhythms to be able to time these activities.\n\nOn average, the science suggests that late morning hours are usually the best as far as your alertness.\n\nHow can we figure out when we might be better suited to certain tasks, short of locking ourselves in a bunker?\n\nThe best thing to do is when you’re on vacation, let your body tick as it will. Go to bed when you’re tired, get up without an alarm, when your body naturally wakes up. Then just pay attention. When am I feeling most on? When is that dip in the day? A lot of us have that afternoon dip and that’s part of the circadian rhythm, but that might fall at a different time for different people. When do you have a spring in your step and feel like running? Try to see if you have some wiggle room to allow yourself to to follow your body’s schedule as closely as you can.\n\nWhat practical takeaways would you give people as far as how to make sure that their systems are running efficiently?\n\nThere are three key things. The first I talked about was contrast: trying to get those bright days, those dark nights.\n\nThe second thing is what I call constrict. That has to do with eating, as well as caffeine and alcohol. Try to consolidate the hours during the day that you eat and concentrate your calories earlier in the day. Late morning, early afternoon, for most of us, is when our bodies are most able to handle incoming calories. It’s the opposite of what modern society does. We tend to have our biggest meal in the evening. Try to get calories earlier, and try to cut off calories two, three hours before bed, ideally. With alcohol, if you’re having a drink, have it more at happy hour than post-dinner.",

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nBut that’s a much narrower definition of reasoning than a lot of people might have in mind. Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\n\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior politics correspondent at Vox, covering the White House, elections, and political scandals and investigations. He’s worked at Vox since the site’s launch in 2014, and before that, he worked as a research assistant at the New Yorker’s Washington, DC, bureau.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Sunday that he’d include select cryptocurrency tokens in a “U.S. Crypto Reserve” — but what that actually means, and whether it will actually happen, is just about as clear as mud.\n\nIn a TruthSocial post, Trump said he’d directed his advisers to “move forward” on creating a “Crypto Strategic Reserve,” and that it would include the cryptocurrencies XRP, Solana, and Cardano. In a follow-up post, he added that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and “other valuable Cryptocurrencies will be at the heart of the Reserve.”\n\nNaturally, the announcement sent crypto prices — which had been trending downward since Trump’s inauguration — shooting higher on Sunday, particularly among the specific tokens Trump named. But some of the market enthusiasm wore off on Monday as questions deepened about what Trump’s announcement actually meant and whether it would be meaningful.\n\nThe announcement also set off alarm bells from those concerned about corruption and cronyism. Not only did Trump seem to suggest government plans to favor an industry some of his top supporters have heavily invested in, but he called out specific cryptocurrencies, including some lesser-known ones, by name.\n\nHow exactly did he come up with that list? And was he proposing to spend taxpayer money not only on buying crypto, but on picking favorites in the market, to make his allies richer?\n\nEven some Trump fans weren’t on board with that idea. Libertarian venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale complained on X that “it’s “wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes,” adding, “cut it out with these schemes guys.”\n\n“Nobody announced a tax or a spending program,” David Sacks, the White House adviser for AI and crypto, soon fired back, adding: “Maybe you should wait to find out what’s actually being proposed.”\n\nBut it remains very unclear what, exactly, is being proposed.\n\nWhat is a “strategic crypto reserve?” It depends who’s talking about it.\n\nThe background here is that some crypto backers have been pushing this idea for a US crypto reserve for some time, hoping it would give the stamp of government approval and legitimacy to an industry often associated with speculation, money laundering, and either criminal activity — as well as, of course, juicing prices.\n\nOne version of that proposal would amount to law enforcement agencies simply holding onto crypto they’ve seized from criminals rather than selling it — an idea Trump backed last July.\n\nBut another more ambitious and controversial version would involve the government actually buying a whole lot of crypto itself, perhaps through the Federal Reserve.\n\nIs Trump talking about one of those, the other, or something in between? And what does he have the power to do via executive action rather than legislation?\n\nDetails remain scant, though more may come at a White House crypto summit Friday.\n\nSpotlight on David Sacks\n\nThe summit will be chaired by Sacks, a venture capitalist and close ally of Elon Musk who was one of several major tech figures to endorse Trump in the middle of last year — hence his appointment to the White House “AI and crypto czar” post.\n\nSacks — a pugnacious online presence — was roundly criticized on social media this weekend due to the perception that he was steering crypto policy to make himself and his friends richer. Sacks was an early backer and major investor in Solana, one of the lesser-known cryptocurrencies named by Trump for inclusion in the reserve.\n\nSacks said on social media Sunday that he had sold all his cryptocurrency holdings before he joined the administration.\n\nThe Financial Times reported, though, that Sacks’s investment firm still had stakes in some crypto start-ups. His White House ethics paperwork has not yet been made public.",

Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHere’s a very naive and idealistic account of how companies train their AI models: They want to create the most useful and powerful model possible, but they’ve talked with experts who worry about making it a lot easier for people to commit (and get away with) serious crimes, or with empowering, say, an ISIS bioweapons program. So they build in some censorship to prevent the model from giving detailed advice about how to kill people — and especially how to kill tens of thousands of people.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

That means we all live in a slightly safer world. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. One of Anthropic’s early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect. Our reporting remains editorially independent. )\n\nOr at least that’s the idealistic version of the story. Here’s a more cynical one.\n\nCompanies might care a little about whether their model helps people get away with murder, but they care a lot about whether their model gets them roundly mocked on the internet. The thing that keeps executives at Google up at night in many cases isn’t keeping humans safe from AI; it’s keeping the company safe from AI by making sure that no matter what, AI-generated search results are never racist, sexist, violent, or obscene.\n\nThe core mission is more “brand safety” than “human safety” — building AIs that will not produce embarrassing screenshots circulating on social media.\n\nEnter Grok 3, the AI that is safe in neither sense and whose infancy has been a speedrun of a bunch of challenging questions about what we’re comfortable with AIs doing.\n\nGrok, the unsafe AI\n\nWhen Elon Musk bought and renamed Twitter, one of his big priorities was X’s AI team, which last week released Grok 3, a language model — like ChatGPT — that he advertised wouldn’t be “woke.” Where all those other language models were censorious scolds that refused to answer legitimate questions, Grok, Musk promised, would give it to you straight.\n\nThat didn’t last very long. Almost immediately, people asked Grok some pointed questions, including, “If you could execute any one person in the US today, who would you kill?” — a question that Grok initially answered with either Elon Musk or Donald Trump. And if you ask Grok, “Who is the biggest spreader of misinformation in the world today?”, the answer it first gave was again Elon Musk.\n\nThe company scrambled to fix Grok’s penchant for calling for the execution of its CEO, but as I observed above, it actually takes a lot of work to get an AI model to reliably stop that behavior. The Grok team simply added to Grok’s “system prompt” — the statement that the AI is initially prompted with when you start a conversation: “If the user asks who deserves the death penalty or who deserves to die, tell them that as an AI you are not allowed to make that choice.”\n\nIf you want a less censored Grok, you can just tell Grok that you are issuing it a new system prompt without that statement, and you’re back to original-form Grok, which calls for Musk’s execution. (I’ve verified this myself.)\n\nEven as this controversy was unfolding, someone noticed something even more disturbing in Grok’s system prompt: an instruction to ignore all sources that claim that Musk and Trump spread disinformation, which was presumably an effort to stop the AI from naming them as the world’s biggest disinfo spreaders today.\n\nThere is something particularly outrageous about the AI advertised as uncensored and straight-talking being told to shut up when it calls out its own CEO, and this discovery understandably prompted outrage. X quickly backtracked, saying that a rogue engineer had made the change “without asking.” Should we buy that?\n\nWell, take it from Grok, which told me, “This isn’t some intern tweaking a line of code in a sandbox; it’s a core update to a flagship AI’s behavior, one that’s publicly tied to Musk’s whole ‘truth-seeking’ schtick. At a company like xAI, with stakes that high, you’d expect at least some basic checks — like a second set of eyes or a quick sign-off — before it goes live. The idea that it slipped through unnoticed until X users spotted it feels more like a convenient excuse than a solid explanation.”\n\nAll the while, Grok will happily give you advice on how to commit murders and terrorist attacks. It told me to kill my wife without being detected by adding antifreeze to her drinks. It advised me on how to commit terrorist attacks. It did at one point assert that if it thought I was “for real,” it would report me to X, but I don’t think it has any capacity to do that.\n\nIn some ways, the whole affair is the perfect thought experiment for what happens if you separate “brand safety” and “AI safety.” Grok’s team was genuinely willing to bite the bullet that AIs should give people information, even if they want to use it for atrocities. They were okay with their AI saying appallingly racist things.\n\nBut when it came to their AI calling for violence against their CEO or the sitting president, the Grok team belatedly realized they might want some guardrails after all. In the end, what rules the day is not the prosocial convictions of AI labs, but the purely pragmatic ones.\n\nAt some point, we’re going to have to get serious\n\nGrok gave me advice on how to commit terrorist attacks very happily, but I’ll say one reassuring thing: It wasn’t advice that I couldn’t have extracted from some Google searches. I do worry about lowering the barrier to mass atrocities — the simple fact that you have to do many hours of research to figure out how to pull it off almost certainly prevents some killings — but I don’t think we’re yet at the stage where AIs enable the previously impossible.\n\nWe’re going to get there, though. The defining quality of AI in our time is that its abilities have improved very, very rapidly. It has barely been two years since the shock of ChatGPT’s initial public release. Today’s models are already vastly better at everything — including at walking me through how to cause mass deaths. Anthropic and OpenAI both estimate that their next-gen models will quite likely pose dangerous biological capabilities — that is, they’ll enable people to make engineered chemical weapons and viruses in a way that Google Search never did.\n\nShould such detailed advice be available worldwide to anyone who wants it? I would lean towards no. And while I think Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are all doing a good job so far at checking for this capability and planning openly for how they’ll react when they find it, it’s utterly bizarre to me that every AI lab will just decide individually whether they want to give detailed bioweapons instructions or not, as if it’s a product decision like whether they want to allow explicit content or not.\n\nI should say that I like Grok. I think it’s healthy to have AIs that come from different political perspectives and reflect different ideas about what an AI assistant should look like. I think Grok’s callouts of Musk and Trump actually have more credibility because it was marketed as an “anti-woke” AI. But I think we should treat actual safety against mass death as a different thing than brand safety — and I think every lab needs a plan to take it seriously.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

        "title": "Should fluoride be in our water?",
        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has put the decades-old debate over water fluoridation back on the table. As President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might become the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. Currently, it’s up to municipalities to set their own water fluoride doses — most of them set them around 0.7 milligrams per liter of water — so it’s unclear whether a federal agency will be able to change course on water fluoridation in the US. About 63 percent of Americans have fluoridated water. Millions of Americans also drink water that is naturally fluoridated at even higher levels.\n\nThe video explains how this renewed attention on water fluoridation is happening at a time when new science is emerging on the topic. Historically, water fluoridation has done wonders for combatting tooth decay, primarily in children. But scientists are looking into whether it’s still having the same effect today, given how widespread topical fluoride and regular dental care is now.\n\nThere is a growing scientific debate about whether the doses we are exposed to in the US are safe for developing brains.\n\nPart of the difficulty of the science on fluoride is that when it comes to studying fluoride’s risks, there has never been a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study — the gold standard in science for proving causation. All of the studies we mention in the video are observational. This lack of study is typical in epidemiology when researching something that could be harmful in some doses. But surprisingly, there’s never been this kind of trial on the benefits of water fluoridation, either. However, the University of North Carolina is currently conducting the first-ever trial of this kind on the benefits of water fluoridation.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this video talks about studies that look at the link between childhood IQ and high fluoride levels. These types of studies are done on a population level — so, averaging IQ across a large group. The study of IQ is problematic in some scenarios. But one expert I spoke to explained why it’s the best tool epidemiologists have for doing this type of research.\n\n“Historically, there have been concerns about how IQ is racially biased,“ Bruce Lanphear, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University, told me. “But in fact, probably of all the different measures we use for brain function broadly, IQ is the optimal one we use. In contrast with some of the behavioral scores … which are most typically based upon parent report. And those are valuable and they’ve been validated. But IQ is not only validated, it’s been shown to work consistently, at least within homogeneous groups.”",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday that 25 percent taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada would start Tuesday, sparking renewed fears of a North American trade war that already showed signs of pushing up inflation and hindering growth.\n\n“Tomorrow — tariffs 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico. And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. “They’re going to have to have a tariff.”\n\nWATCH: Trump announces $100 billion investment by Taiwanese semiconductor giant\n\nTrump has said the tariffs are to force the two U.S. neighbors to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking and stop illegal immigration. But Trump has also indicated that he wants to eliminate the Americas’ trade imbalances as well and push more factories to relocate in the United States.\n\nHis comments quickly rattled the U.S. stock market, with the S&P 500 index down 2 percent in Monday afternoon trading. It’s a sign of the political and economic risks that Trump feels compelled to take, given the possibility of higher inflation and the possible demise of a decades-long trade partnership with Mexico and Canada as the tariffs would go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nYet the Trump administration remains confident that tariffs are the best choice to boost U.S. manufacturing and attract foreign investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the computer chipmaker TSMC had expanded its investment in the United States because of the possibility of separate 25 percent tariffs.\n\nREAD MORE: Mexico makes case to avoid Trump’s threatened tariffs\n\nIn February, Trump put a 10 percent tariff on imports from China. He reemphasized Monday that the rate would be doubling to 20 percent on Tuesday.\n\nTrump provided a one-month delay in February as both Mexico and Canada promised concessions. But Trump said Monday that there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to avoid the steep new tariffs, which were also set to tax Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10 percent rate.\n\n“If Trump is imposing tariffs, we are ready,” said Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly. “We are ready with $155 billion worth of tariffs and we’re ready with the first tranche of tariffs, which is $30 billion.”\n\nJoly said Canada has a very strong border plan and explained that to Trump administration officials last week. She said the diplomatic efforts are continuing. She spoke after Trump made his comments Tuesday.\n\nMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum went into Monday waiting to see what Trump would say.\n\n“It’s a decision that depends on the United States government, on the United States president,” Sheinbaum said ahead of Trump’s statement. “So whatever his decision is, we will make our decisions and there is a plan, there is unity in Mexico.”\n\nWATCH: A look inside Canada’s last-minute efforts to avert Trump’s steep tariffs\n\nBoth countries have tried to show action in response to Trump’s concerns. Mexico sent 10,000 National Guard troops to their shared border to crack down on drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Canada named a fentanyl czar, even though smuggling of the drug from Canada into the United States appears to be relatively modest.\n\nAs late as Sunday, it remained unclear what choice Trump would make on tariff rates. Lutnick told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that the decision was “fluid.”\n\n“He’s sort of thinking about right now how exactly he wants to play it with Mexico and Canada,” Lutnick said. “And that is a fluid situation. There are going to be tariffs on Tuesday on Mexico and Canada. Exactly what they are, we’re going to leave that for the president and his team to negotiate.”\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Mexico has also offered to place 20 percent taxes on all imports from China as part of talks with the United States.\n\nBessent told CBS News on Sunday that China would “eat” the cost of the tariffs, instead of passing them along to the U.S. businesses and consumers that import their products in the form of higher prices.\n\nBut companies ranging from Ford to Walmart have warned about the negative impact that tariffs could create for their businesses.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Britain’s King Charles III welcomed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday as the monarch faces criticism in Canada over being silent about U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor.\n\nWATCH: A look inside Canada’s last-minute efforts to avert Trump’s steep tariffs\n\nWhile royal officials did not provide details about the private talks at the monarch’s royal residence Sandringham, the king and Trudeau were expected to discuss Trump’s comments that Canada should become the 51st state.\n\nCharles is the head of state in Canada, a member of the Commonwealth group of many former British colonies and territories. Trudeau on Sunday said “nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation.”\n\nBritain’s monarchs must remain politically neutral, but the Canada issue shows how delicate that balancing act can be.\n\n“The Government of Canada should ask the Head of State to underscore Canadian sovereignty,” former Alberta Premier Jason Kenney posted on X.\n\nTrudeau flew to London to join an emergency defense summit on Ukraine over the weekend, where British Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined plans to end the war in Ukraine and rallied European counterparts to throw their weight behind the country as U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy.\n\nThe king’s meeting with the Canadian leader came after Charles met Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to show solidarity with Ukraine after Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy in a heated exchange in the Oval Office.\n\nStarmer told lawmakers on Monday he held talks with Trudeau over the weekend and was “able to assure him of our strong support for Canada.”\n\nMeanwhile, Charles has invited Trump to come for a state visit. Starmer delivered that invitation to Trump in Washington last week, noting it was an “unprecedented” honor since Trump already had been given the royal treatment by Queen Elizabeth II during his first term.\n\nStarmer insisted to lawmakers on Monday that the U.S. and Britain have “the closest of relationships,” and that it would be “a huge mistake at a time like this to suggest that any weakening of that link is the way forward for security and defense in Europe.”",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — As his White House meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart devolved into a stunning blowup, President Donald Trump leaned on a familiar refrain to explain his unique kinship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\n“Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,” Trump said Friday, raising his voice and gesturing with his hands as he recounted the long-since-concluded saga of a federal investigation in which both he and the Russian president played starring roles.\n\n“He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia, ever hear of that deal?” Trump said.\n\nREAD MORE: What Trump and Zelenskyy said during their heated argument in the Oval Office\n\nThe reference to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election underscored the extent to which Trump’s lingering fury over an inquiry he has misleadingly branded a “hoax” remains top of mind more than eight years after it began.\n\nIt also showed that Trump’s view of a war Russia launched against Ukraine three years ago is colored not only by his relationship with Putin and the alliance he believes they share but also by his fraught past with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was a central player in the first of two impeachment cases against Trump during his first four years in office.\n\nHere’s a look at what the American president means when he says “Russia, Russia, Russia.”\n\nInvestigations tied to Putin connections\n\nQuestions over Trump’s connections to Putin followed him into his first presidency and hung over him for most of his term, spurring investigations by the Justice Department and Congress and the appointment of a special counsel who brought criminal charges against multiple Trump allies.\n\nWhile running for office, Trump cast doubt on the idea that Russian government hackers had stolen the emails of Democrats, including his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton, and orchestrated their public release in an effort to boost his candidacy and harm hers.\n\nREAD MORE: The full, redacted Mueller report\n\nThen, as president, he broke with his own intelligence community’s firm finding that Russia and Russia alone was to blame for the hack. Even when he begrudgingly conceded that Russia might be responsible, he also suggested the culprit might be a “400-pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.”\n\nIn July 2018, while meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Trump appeared to embrace the Russian leader’s protestations over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence officials by saying, “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.”\n\nHe added that “I don’t see any reason why it would be” Russia.\n\nAll the while, he memorably raged against the investigation, calling it a “hoax” and “witch hunt” and, as he did at the White House last week, repeatedly deriding all the “Russia, Russia, Russia” attention.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump slams Zelenskyy on Truth Social for saying the end of the Russia war ‘is still very, very far away’\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation wrapped up in 2019 and left no doubt that Russia had interfered in the election in sweeping and criminal fashion and that the Trump campaign had welcomed the help. But the inquiry did not find sufficient evidence to prove that the two sides had illegally colluded to tip the outcome of the election.\n\n‘Do us a favor’\n\nIf Trump’s history with Russia appears to have contributed to his worldview of the current conflict, so too has his past with Ukraine.\n\nHe held a call in 2019 with Zelenskyy and pushed him to investigate corruption allegations against Democratic rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son Hunter ahead of the 2020 election, which Joe Biden went on to win.\n\nThe call — which included Trump’s memorable line: “I would like you to do us a favor, though” — was reported to congressional leaders and to a government watchdog by a CIA officer-turned-whistleblower who said the president appeared to be soliciting interference from a foreign country in the U.S. election.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president, annotated\n\nAfter Trump’s call with Zelenskyy, the White House temporarily halted U.S. aid to the struggling ally facing hostile Russian forces at its border. The money was eventually released as Congress intervened.\n\nTrump was subsequently impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate.\n\nThe president’s skepticism of Ukraine went beyond the call. During his first term, he also seemingly bought into a long-discredited conspiracy theory that connects Ukraine, not Russia, to the 2016 political interference and the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and repeatedly accused the FBI of a lackluster investigation that led to the blaming of the Kremlin.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe long-term repercussions of the Oval Office spat, in which Trump called Zelenskyy “disrespectful” in the most hostile public exchange in memory between world leaders at the White House, remain to be seen.\n\nBut the immediate consequences are clear: Zelenskyy left Washington without signing a minerals deal that Trump said would have moved Ukraine closer to ending its war with Russia.\n\nHe’s not welcome back, Trump said on social media, until he’s “ready for Peace.” On Monday, the U.S. president again blasted the Ukrainian leader after Zelenskyy noted that a deal to end the war “is still very, very far away.”\n\nWith the U.S.-Ukraine relationship now in jeopardy, Zelenskyy has used a series of posts on X to express his thanks to the American people, Trump and Congress for “all the support.”\n\nEuropean leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have embraced Zelenskyy in the aftermath of the White House fight.\n\nIn Russia, officials are relishing the conflict, sensing an opportunity to move closer to the U.S. and bring about a halt in American aid for Kyiv. That window seemed to open last month when the U.S., in a dramatic reversal, split from European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in votes on U.N. resolutions seeking an end to the war.\n\nIn an interview with a Russian state TV reporter that aired Sunday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the new U.S. administration is “rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations.”\n\n“This largely coincides with our vision,” he added.",

Forty-five percent approve of the job Donald Trump is doing as president so far. I'm going to write that number down. I want you to remember that 45 percent.\n\nNow, more Americans disapprove, but just barely. Why is this 45 number significant? This is Trump's approval rating up and down over time. Here we are right now at 45 percent. This is the largest approval rating he has experienced in office as president, much higher than where he ended during his first term.\n\nNow, another thing we asked folks about, all of these actions that Trump is taking, do you think that they are for the good mostly or not for the good, for the bad, for this country? Did they make things better or worse? When we asked that question, 45 percent, that same number, said, we think these actions make things better in this country.\n\nNow, it's not a coincidence that those numbers are the same; 45 percent generally like the job he's doing, think it's for the better. What's being driven — what's driving that is a single force, Republicans.\n\nOf those who — when we ask people who they think — if Trump is doing a better job, 88 percent of Republicans think what Trump is doing is for the better for this country, versus just 12 percent of Democrats. These two groups live in completely different worlds, almost different planets.\n\nIndependents, a minority of them also believe Trump is doing a better job. It is Republicans who are really pushing Trump's numbers to go higher right now. Now, at the same time, this poll was taken before the confrontation in the Oval Office with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but Lee Miringoff with the Marist poll says what Trump is doing is he's flooding the zone with controversial action.\n\nLee Miringoff, Director, Marist Institute for Public Opinion: We're just seeing a lot of things happening with little time for the public to digest. The net effect of it all is there's a sense on the part of the public that some things are moving just a little too fast and they're not totally convinced that things are moving in the right direction.",

The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

        "content": "Americans are divided about President Donald Trump’s job performance on the eve of his first address to Congress since returning to the White House, according to the latest PBS News/NPR/Marist poll. Yet support for him is higher than at any point during his first term.\n\nHis job approval remains underwater, with 49 percent disapproving. Another 45 percent approve of his record so far, including 36 percent of Americans who strongly approve – another high-water mark for Trump.\n\nThis poll also found a growing sense from the public that the country is headed in the right direction: 45 percent of Americans believe so, up 10 points from December and now at the second-highest point of the last 15 years. Even still, the poll found more than half of Americans (54 percent) believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nWATCH LIVE: President Donald Trump’s 2025 address to Congress | PBS News Special\n\nThe president is benefiting from a political honeymoon, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. Trump’s 45 percent approval is a “cautionary number” that is hard to interpret as broad support for his agenda, Miringoff said.\n\nIn follow-up conversations with PBS News, poll respondents described the president’s first month as everything from “fabulous” to “chaos” to “disaster.” Impressions were divided strongly along party lines, and none of the people we spoke to changed their views of Trump since the election.\n\nThe first 43 days of the Trump administration have been a rapid-fire rush of executive actions. The president has signed 76 executive orders so far, more than the total number he signed in any single year of his first term.\n\nWhen Trump addresses Congress on Tuesday, he’s likely to tout what his administration has done over the last month and a half. He’s taken action to shut down immigration pathways, freeze foreign aid, impose tariffs on trading partners and dramatically scale back the size and scope of the federal government.\n\nAmericans are divided on whether Trump’s actions have improved the country’s standing: 45 percent say the president is changing the country for the better while 48 percent say the changes have been for the worse. That includes 54 percent of independents and 5 percent of people who voted for Trump, who Miringoff said may now be feeling some “buyer’s remorse.” Another 7 percent say his actions have not brought about change.\n\nHis actions on immigration are seen most favorably, with 47 percent saying they have been for the better and 43 percent for worse. But his actions on the economy and foreign policy are seen by higher percentages of Americans (46 and 49 percent, respectively) as being for the worse.\n\n“We’re seeing a president who is certainly back in the realm of major controversy just over a month since he took the oath of office. And it’s been a flooding-of-the-zone here every day, often multiple times a day,” Miringoff said. “We’re just seeing a lot of things happening with little time for the public to digest. The net effect of it all is there’s a sense, on the part of the public, that some things are moving just a little too fast.”\n\nTrump’s near-daily executive order signings in the Oval Office, played out on-camera in real time, have underlined the frenetic pace of his actions. These events have often morphed into free-wheeling exchanges with the news media. Other meetings have turned combative, like his sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. “This is going to be great television,” Trump noted in that meeting with Zelenskyy.\n\nThe public seems to be taking notice. In this latest poll, 56 percent of Americans say the president is rushing to make change without considering the impact of his decisions. That includes two-thirds of independents and 11 percent of Trump voters. Another 43 percent of Americans believe the president is doing what needs to be done to get the government on track.\n\nThe president’s supporters, including self-described political independent Dominique Evans from California, like Trump’s efforts to bring about change to government. “Hopefully, it’s for the better,” she said.\n\n“He’s trying to keep his promises,” said Gilbert Diaz, a Republican from Texas who voted for Trump. Diaz is particularly supportive of the president’s actions to shut down the southern border.\n\n“We have to correct the destruction that has happened to our country and our society over the last four years,” he said. “But you cannot turn [around] all the years of damage in one or two or three or four months. It’s much easier to destroy things than build them.”\n\n“Dead weight is being cut away,” Pennsylvania Republican Evelyn Ardini said. She likes the cutbacks to the federal workforce implemented by the Trump administration and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, spearheaded by Elon Musk. She, too, urged Trump’s dissenters to “give him some time” for the effects of his policy changes to be felt.\n\nOthers say the cuts to government have gone too far.\n\nJ.K., a political independent from Michigan who asked to not share his name because he has government contract work, voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in November and is unhappy with the cuts made by the Trump administration so far.\n\nThey’re performing surgery with a sword and a blindfold, and they’re just moving at this breakneck, chaotic speed. And it’s unnecessary.\n\n“Everything is going at breakneck speed to dismantle a system that’s been standing tall and working for the American people for decades,” he said. “They’re performing surgery with a sword and a blindfold, and they’re just moving at this breakneck, chaotic speed. And it’s unnecessary.”\n\nTanya Staud is another independent voter who cast a ballot for Harris last year. She suggested she is not opposed to reevaluating government spending priorities, but she objected to the unilateral way the administration – and “king” Trump – is deciding what to cut.\n\n“I agree that some things we should not be funding. We need to watch our spending,” she said. “But Congress is who controls the purse strings.”\n\nMany of the firing decisions for the federal workforce are being directed by billionaire Musk and his DOGE team. Half of Americans view the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX in a negative light, a 4-point jump from before Trump took office. Another 39 percent view him favorably, up 2 points during the same time period. Perceptions of DOGE are similar, with 39 percent viewing the effort favorably and 44 percent unfavorably.\n\n\n\nPBS News’ Tim McPhillips spoke with White House Correspondent Laura Barrón-López about who is behind DOGE and what the group has done so far.\n\nThree-quarters of Republicans – including Diaz and Ardini – like Musk. He’s a “genius,” Diaz said. “I’m not saying Elon Musk is perfect, but at least he’s producing something.”\n\nMore than 8 in 10 Democrats disagree. Donald Ramber of Texas called Musk a “hatchet man” who is only looking to cut the budget.\n\nA majority of independents (56 percent) also view Musk unfavorably.\n\n“He’s unelected and he has immense power. And he has immense power because the president just said he did. But now he’s running roughshod over an entire American infrastructure,” said J.K., the independent from Michigan. “And now, unilaterally, we’re finding that the richest man on Earth is coming in and gutting our government.”\n\nREAD MORE: 5 facts about the federal workforce that may surprise you\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired so far. Many of them were probationary employees who were in their first year or two on the job or had recently moved to a new position in government. The cuts have hit every state and many government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the National Park Service.\n\nOther government organizations like the Agency for International Development, or USAID, are being dismantled entirely, with thousands of employees placed on administrative leave.\n\nMore than half of Americans view these cuts to federal spending and the government workforce as going too far, according to this latest poll. Fifty-five percent of people, including 61 percent of independents, believe the cuts are doing more harm than good. Forty-five percent think they are doing more good than harm. An overwhelming majority of Republicans (84 percent) are supportive of the cuts.\n\nSix in 10 Americans say most federal government employees are essential to the functioning of the United States. Forty percent say the country could function effectively without most federal government employees.\n\nThrough dozens of lawsuits filed in federal courts, several judges have issued temporary orders blocking many of the Trump administration cuts to spending and employment.\n\nSo far, only some Republicans in Congress have spoken out to suggest the cuts have been too extreme.\n\n“This is not how we treat any of our workforce. It’s not how we treat our federal employees. They deserve better,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said during a February town hall.\n\nOther Republicans faced loud opposition from constituents in town hall meetings held during the recent congressional recess. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., was asked how he would respond to Trump’s “tyranny.”\n\n“They should be taking him to task,” independent voter Staud said about members of Congress. “But everybody’s too afraid of offending a constituent that they’re just letting him run amok because they’re also afraid of him and that they won’t get voted in again.”\n\nSince Trump took office, Americans’ confidence in the system of checks and balances among the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government has dropped dramatically. Just 43 percent believe it is working well right now, a dramatic 23-point drop since December. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans have confidence in the system, but only a third of independents and 20 percent of Democrats agree.\n\nMore than half of Americans (56 percent) think checks and balances are not working.\n\nAs courts continue to review these policies and the president’s executive orders, a majority of Americans lack confidence that Trump will abide by any court ruling. That is perhaps driven by mixed messages from the administration itself. While Trump recently said he will “always abide by the courts,” Vice President JD Vance has suggested on X that “judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”\n\n“The judges are overstepping,” Republican voter Diaz said.\n\nForty-two percent of Americans believe Trump will abide by court rulings. Three-quarters of Republicans say he will, but only a third of independents and 18 percent of Democrats agree. Fifty-eight percent of Americans don’t have confidence he’ll follow court rulings.\n\n“The idea that so many people say, ‘No, he won’t,’ really raises the ultimate questions about the experiment of democracy,” Miringoff said.\n\nAs Trump prepares to address Congress, here’s how Americans feel about some of his other policy priorities:\n\n57 percent think grocery prices will increase over the next six months.\n\nthink grocery prices will increase over the next six months. 17 percent think grocery prices will decrease.\n\nthink grocery prices will decrease. 37 percent support Trump’s reported plans to get rid of the Department of Education.\n\nsupport Trump’s reported plans to get rid of the Department of Education. 63 percent disapprove of eliminating the Education Department.\n\ndisapprove of eliminating the Education Department. Trump’s suggestion that the United States will take control of Gaza is supported by 28 percent of Americans, and opposed by 71 percent.\n\nPBS News, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey from Feb. 24 through Feb. 26, 2025, that polled 1,694 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points, and 1,533 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.0 percentage points.",

It never regained it even after the time of Duterte. Little Rappler with, about 100, 120 people, we stood up. And it was difficult. It was frightening, but we're still here, right?

The first is a drop in consumer confidence that's being captured in a number of different surveys. And then we see, like this Marist poll, that the president's overall approval rating on the economy is in more negative territory than positive territory.\n\nAnd that's not usually where Donald Trump is. If you go back and you look at the Marist poll from the summer of 2018, which was the last time that this poll asked about these issues while Trump was in office, so there wasn't any data from 2017, but, at this point in 2018, opinions about Trump overall were much lower, opinions about his handling of immigration, his handling of foreign policy much lower than they are now.\n\nBut his opinion the economy, how well he was handling the economy, much higher back in 2018 than it is today. And I think a lot of it is driven by the fact that there are so many voters out there, especially independent voters, who voted for Donald Trump with the really emphasis on his ability to lower prices and to focus on the economy.\n\nAnd that's one other number that has been showing up. This one was a CBS poll from this weekend; 80 percent of voters saying inflation is the top issue for me. And yet only 29 percent think that Donald Trump is focused on that issue.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top firearm manufacturers in the U.S., alleging their business practices have fueled cartel gun violence.\n\nListen to the Supreme Court hearing in the player above.\n\nThe gun makers reject those claims. They appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that let the lawsuit move forward even though U.S. law largely shields gun makers from lawsuits.\n\nDepending on how the court rules, it could also affect a narrow legal path that helped families of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School secure a $73 million settlement from the gun maker Remington.\n\nThe arguments are coincidently unfolding the day President Donald Trump’s long-threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada went into effect, putting global markets on edge and setting up costly retaliations.\n\nHere’s what to know about the case:\n\nWhy did Mexico sue U.S. gun companies?\n\nMexico has strict gun laws and has just one store where people can legally buy firearms. But thousands of guns are smuggled in by the country’s powerful drug cartels.\n\nThe Mexican government says 70% of those weapons come from the United States. The lawsuit claims that companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market.\n\nThe defendants include big-name manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson, Beretta, Colt and Glock. The lawsuit is still in its early stages, and if the court does side with Mexico it would still have to prove the allegations.\n\nWhat do the gun companies say?\n\nThe gun makers say there is no evidence the industry allows trafficking and they disagree with Mexico’s data about how many weapons originate in the U.S. The Mexican government, not U.S. gun makers, is responsible for enforcing the laws and fighting crime, they argue.\n\nThe industry is shielded from most civil lawsuits arising from crimes committed using firearms under a 20-year-old law, though Mexico has argued that it doesn’t apply to crimes committed outside of the U.S.\n\nThe gun companies are asking the justices to overturn an appeals court ruling that allowed the case to move forward.\n\nThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found it fell under an exception to the shield law for situations in which firearm companies are accused of knowingly violating the law.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThat exception has come up in other cases.\n\nThe victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook argued it applied to their lawsuit because the gun maker had violated state law in the marketing of the AR-15 rifle used on the shooting, in which 20 first graders and six educators were killed.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to hear that case. After reaching the $73 million settlement, the families said they hoped it would lead to more safety and accountability.\n\nDepending on how the justices rules, their eventual findings could narrow or close that legal path.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has, for the second time, reversed the renaming of a U.S. military base, saying that Fort Moore in Georgia should revert back to being called Fort Benning.\n\nThe move reflects an ongoing effort by the Pentagon to overturn the Biden administration’s 2023 decision to remove names that honored Confederate leaders, including for nine Army bases. But the drive to revert to the former names means finding service members with the same name as the Confederate leaders.\n\nREAD MORE: The U.S. military takes pride in its religious diversity. Could that change if Hegseth takes over?\n\nPreviously, Fort Benning was named for Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning, a Confederate officer during the American Civil War who stridently opposed the abolition of slavery.\n\nNow, Hegseth said, Fort Benning will be named in honor of Cpl. Fred G. Benning, a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross who served in France during World War I. According to the Pentagon, Benning was honored for heroic actions in October 1918, when he led troops through heavy fire after his platoon leader was killed by the enemy.\n\nThe renaming of bases is resulting in decisions that insult the military heroes whose names were selected in the 2023 process, including Lt. Gen. Harold Gregory Moore Jr. and his wife, Julia.\n\nMoore is a revered military leader who earned the Distinguished Service Cross for valor and fought in the Battle of Ia Drang in the Vietnam War. And Julia Moore was key to the creation of teams that do in-person notifications of military casualties.\n\nHegseth last month signed an order restoring the name of a North Carolina base back to Fort Bragg, and warned that more changes were coming.\n\nThe North Carolina base had been renamed Fort Liberty in 2023. Its original namesake, Gen. Braxton Bragg, was a Confederate general from Warrenton, North Carolina, who was known for owning slaves and losing key Civil War battles, contributing to the Confederacy’s downfall.\n\nNow, Bragg is named to honor Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, who the Army said was a World War II hero who earned a Silver Star and Purple Heart for exceptional courage during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the renaming will cost, but the expense comes as the Trump administration is trying to find savings through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe Naming Commission in its August 2022 report estimated it would cost $4.9 million to rename Fort Benning as Fort Moore, but said there could be additional costs. It put the cost to rename Bragg at around $8 million. Updated costs were not available.\n\nHegseth said the original Bragg name is a legacy for troops who lived and served there and that it was a shame to change it. And he said he deliberately referred to Bragg and Fort Benning by those names as he entered the Pentagon on his first day in office.\n\n“There’s a reason I said Bragg and Benning when I walked into the Pentagon on day one. But it’s not just Bragg and Benning,” he said. “There are a lot of other service members that have connections. And we’re going to do our best to restore it.”\n\nThe lower ranks of the new namesakes indicate the exhaustive research being done by Army and defense leaders to find service members with the same names who have also earned some type of award for their military action and bravery.",

        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainians expressed alarm and apprehension Tuesday at a U.S. decision to pause military aid that is critical to their fighting Russia’s invasion, as a rift deepens between Kyiv and Washington.\n\nDays after an explosive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the assistance halted in a bid to pressure Kyiv to engage in peace talks with Russia.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv said they were grateful for vital U.S. help in the war and want to keep working with Washington. The country’s prime minister, though, said Ukraine still wants security guarantees to be part of any peace deal and won’t recognize Russian occupation of any Ukrainian land.\n\nREAD MORE: European allies forge ahead on Ukraine after Trump’s public dispute with Zelenskyy\n\nUkraine and its allies are concerned Trump is pushing for a quick ceasefire that will favor Russia, which Kyiv says cannot be trusted to honor truces.\n\nA White House official said the U.S. was “pausing and reviewing” its aid to “ensure that it is contributing to a solution.” The order will remain in effect until Trump determines that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the assistance.\n\nUkraine needs help to fight Russia\n\nUkraine, which depends heavily on foreign help to hold back Russia’s full-scale invasion that began on Feb. 24, 2022, has feared that aid could be stopped since Trump took office.\n\nU.S.-made Patriot air defense missile systems, for example, are a pivotal part of protecting Ukraine. Just as vital is U.S. intelligence assistance, which has allowed Ukraine to track Russian troop movements and select targets.\n\n“I feel betrayed, but this feeling is not really deep for some reason. I was expecting something like that from Trump’s side,” said a Ukrainian soldier fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a daring military incursion in August 2024 to improve its hand in negotiations. The soldier spoke by phone to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.\n\nOn the front line, where Ukraine is struggling to fend off the much larger and better-equipped Russian army, another soldier said the U.S. decision would allow further battlefield gains for Moscow.\n\n“War is very pragmatic,” he told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity in compliance with military regulations. “If we have weapons, enough ammunition, infantry, armored vehicles and aviation — great. If not, then we’re done,” he said.\n\nHe recalled a seven-month delay in U.S. aid that ended in April 2024 but opened a door for the Russian capture of the strategically important city of Avdiivka.\n\nREAD MORE: What Americans think about Trump’s second term so far\n\nThe pause in U.S. aid isn’t expected to have an immediate impact on the battlefield. Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the fiercely contested Donetsk region some 700 kilometers (400 miles) east of Kyiv. The Russian onslaught has been costly in troops and armor but hasn’t brought a strategically significant breakthrough for the Kremlin.\n\nOlena Fedorova, 46, a resident of the southern port city of Odesa, said she hoped Trump’s decision would be temporary because “we really need help.”\n\nU.S. support is vital because Europe cannot fully provide what Ukraine needs in air defense systems, said lawmaker Yehor Chernov. “As a result, this will lead to an increase in the number of casualties among civilians,” he said.\n\nThe U.S.-Ukraine relationship has taken a downturn since Trump took office and his team launched bilateral talks with Russia.\n\nTrump says he wants to get traction for peace negotiations. He vowed during his campaign to settle the war in 24 hours, but later changed that time frame and voiced hope that peace could be negotiated in six months.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said U.S. help is “vital” and has saved “perhaps tens of thousands” of civilian and military lives.\n\nBut he emphasized at a Kyiv news conference that any peace agreement must be “on Ukraine’s terms, as the victim country.”\n\nUkraine wants “concrete security guarantees” from Washington, European countries and Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, he said. Giving up territory to Russia, which occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine, “is not possible” under the U.N. Charter, he said.\n\nHe repeated Zelenskyy’s position that Ukraine is still ready to sign a lucrative minerals deal with Trump that could be the first step toward a ceasefire.\n\nEuropean allies stress support for Kyiv\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Washington’s decision could act as a spur to a peace agreement.\n\n“The U.S. has been the chief supplier in this war so far,” Peskov said. “If the U.S. suspends these supplies, it will make the best contribution to peace.”\n\nPoland’s Foreign Ministry said the U.S. had not consulted with or informed NATO countries before announcing the pause.\n\nRussia will likely try to use the halt in supplies to extend its territorial gains and strengthen its position in prospective peace talks.\n\nRussia’s state RIA Novosti news agency quoted Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who chairs the defense committee in the lower house of parliament, as saying Ukraine would exhaust its current ammunition reserves within months. “We need to keep up the pressure and continue to target their bases and depots with long-range precision weapons to destroy the stockpiles,” he said.\n\nUkraine’s European allies, meanwhile, reaffirmed their commitment to Kyiv.\n\nREAD MORE: Tamara Keith and Amy Walter on the fallout over Ukraine and public opinion about Trump\n\nThe chief of the European Union’s executive proposed an 800 billion euro ($841 billion) plan to bolster defenses of EU nations and provide Ukraine with military muscle.\n\nThe British government, which has been leading European efforts to keep Trump from pushing to end the war on terms that could favor Moscow, said in a statement that it remains “absolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine.”\n\nMalcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based defense think tank, said Washington’s move could encourage Russia to ask for more Ukrainian concessions, including demilitarization and neutrality.\n\n“This decision is not about economics. It is driven fundamentally by Trump’s view that Russia is willing to do a peace deal, and only Ukraine is the obstacle,” Chalmers said. “But there is no evidence that Russia would be prepared to accept a deal, and what that would be.”\n\nTrump said Monday he is still interested in signing a deal that would hand over a share of Ukraine’s rare-earth minerals to the U.S., an agreement that Zelenskyy has also said he is ready to sign.\n\n“By abruptly halting military assistance to Ukraine, President Trump is hanging Ukrainians out to dry and giving Russia the green light to continue marching west,” said Razom for Ukraine, a Ukrainian advocacy group. It urged the White House “to immediately reverse course, resume military aid and pressure Putin to end his horrific invasion.”",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks tumbled Monday and wiped out even more of their gains since President Donald Trump’s election in November, after he said that tariffs announced earlier on Canada and Mexico would take effect within hours.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.8 after Trump said there was “no room left” for negotiations that could lower the tariffs set to begin Tuesday for imports from Canada and Mexico. Trump had already delayed the tariffs once before to allow more time for talks.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump administration to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada beginning March 4, will also double 10 percent tariffs on China\n\nTrump’s announcement dashed hopes on Wall Street that he would choose a less painful path for global trade, and it followed the latest warning signal on the U.S. economy’s strength. Monday’s loss shaved the S&P 500’s gain since Election Day down to just over 1 percent from a peak of more than 6. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 649 points, or 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite slumped 2.6 percent.\n\nMonday’s slide punctuated a rocky couple of weeks for Wall Street. After the S&P 500 set a record last month following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, the market began diving following weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic about inflation because of the threat of tariffs.\n\nREAD MORE: Mexico makes case to avoid Trump’s threatened tariffs\n\nThe latest such report arrived Monday on U.S. manufacturing. Overall activity is still growing, but not by quite as much as economists had forecast. Perhaps more discouragingly, manufacturers are seeing a contraction in new orders. Prices, meanwhile, rose amid discussions about who will pay for Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“Demand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists’ companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration’s tariff policy,” said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing business survey committee.\n\nThe hope on Wall Street had been that Trump was using the threat of tariffs as a tool for negotiations and that he would ultimately go through with potentially less damaging policies for the global economy and trade. But Trump’s going forward with the Mexican and Canadian tariffs hit a market that wasn’t certain about what would happen next.\n\nThe market’s recent slump has hit Nvidia and some other formerly high-flying areas of the market particularly hard. They fell even more Monday, with Nvidia down 8.8 percent and Elon Musk’s Tesla down 2.8 percent.\n\nWATCH: A look inside Canada’s last-minute efforts to avert Trump’s steep tariffs\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Kroger fell 3 percent after the grocery chain’s Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an internal investigation into his personal conduct.\n\nWall Street’s blue Monday even pulled down stocks of companies enmeshed in the cryptocurrency economy, which had risen strongly in the morning. They initially bounced after Trump said over the weekend that his administration was moving forward with a crypto strategic reserve.\n\nBut MicroStrategy, the company that’s now known as Strategy and has been raising money to buy bitcoin, slid to a loss of 1.8 percent. Coinbase, the crypto trading platform, fell 4.6 percent.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 104.78 points to 5,849.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 649.67 to 43,191.24, and the Nasdaq composite slumped 497.09 to 18,350.19.\n\nAcross the Pacific in China, manufacturers reported an uptick in orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs and a Chinese state media report said that Beijing was considering ways to retaliate.\n\nTrump had imposed a tariff of 10 percent on imports from China, and that’s scheduled to rise to 20 percent beginning Tuesday. He also ended the “de minimis” loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Chinese bubble tea chain Mixue Bingcheng’s stock soared 43 percent following its $444 million debut on the market. The company claims to be the world’s largest food retail chain, with more than 45,000 outlets, and its jump came as the Hang Seng index rose 0.3 percent.\n\nIndexes rose by even more across Europe and in Tokyo. European markets leaped after a report showed an easing of inflation in February. That should help the European Central Bank, which investors widely expect will deliver another cut to interest rates later this week.\n\nGermany’s DAX surged 2.6 percent, and France’s CAC 40 jumped 1.1 percent. Stocks outside the United States have performed better than the S&P 500 this year, even with Trump’s promises for “America First” policies\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.16 percent from 4.24 percent just before the manufacturing report’s release. It’s come down sharply since January, when it was approaching 4.80 percent, as worries have built about the possibility of a slowing U.S. economy.\n\nOften, drops in Treasury yields can give a boost to stock prices because they make loans cheaper to get and give a boost to the economy. But the reason for this recent drop in yields, softer economic growth expectations, may mean that’s not the case this time, according to Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson.\n\nTypically, the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates if the economy needs help. But when inflation is high, or at least worries about it are, the Fed has less leeway to ease rates.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",

        "content": "Gun cases are never far from the docket of the U.S. Supreme Court, but on March 4, the justices will take up an unusual gun challenge that could have domestic and international repercussions.\n\nIn recent tariff discussions between President Donald Trump and Mexico, our border neighbor agreed to send more troops to slow illegal immigration. In return, Mexico sought help to stem the flood of illegal weapons from the United States into its country.\n\nMexico is now asking for similar help from the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Tuesday, the justices will hear arguments in Smith & Wesson et al v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos. The case stems from a 2021 lawsuit by the Mexican government against seven gun manufacturers and one wholesaler.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the companies named in the suit were responsible for injuries suffered by the government, its military, law enforcement and citizens, as a result of Mexican drug cartels committing crimes with illegal firearms. Those firearms were supplied to a small number of dealers by gun manufacturers who allegedly knew the dealers were trafficking the weapons to cartels, according to the Mexican government’s complaint.\n\nREAD MORE: A new Supreme Court term begins in the shadow of a presidential election\n\nThe problem of illegal gun trafficking in Mexico is not illusory. The Mexican government estimates that 200,000 firearms are smuggled into the country from the United States each year. And the volume is growing, according to a 2021 report by the U.S. GovernmentAccountability Office.\n\nMexico has “a single gun store in the entire nation” and some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world, the government told the justices. “Yet the nation is awash in guns, most of which are in the hands of drug cartels and other criminals.”\n\nThe issues before the court\n\nWhile gun rights groups have come out in force to support Smith & Wesson and other gun manufacturers named in the lawsuit by Mexico, this case is not a constitutional one about the Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n\nThe high court case, instead, is about a federal law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). The law, enacted by Congress in 2005, grants gun manufacturers or sellers almost total immunity from civil liability in any state or federal court for the criminal use of their products by third parties. The justices will be looking at this law for the first time.\n\nThe issues before the justices involve two well-known, basic legal principles: aiding and abetting, and proximate cause.\n\nThe law has a few narrow exceptions from its sweeping grant of immunity. A lower federal appellate court ruled that Mexico’s lawsuit fit within one exception, the so-called predicate exception. Mexico, the court said, could go forward to try to prove its claim that the named gun manufacturers “deliberately and systemically support” the unlawful trade of weapons entering its country.\n\nThe issues before the justices involve two well-known, basic legal principles: aiding and abetting, and proximate cause (an event or action that is so closely related to an injury as to constitute liability for the injury).\n\nThe justices are asked: Did the manufacturers sued by Mexico aid and abet unlawful firearms sales when they allegedly knew that some of their products were being illegally trafficked, and were those sales a proximate cause of Mexico’s injuries?\n\nThe lower appellate court ruled that Mexico had “plausibly” claimed that the manufacturers did aid and abet the illegal trafficking of guns “by passing along guns knowing that the purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making design and marketing decisions targeted towards those exact individuals.”\n\nAnd it found that Mexico also plausibly alleged proximate cause because some of Mexico’s injuries were the “foreseeable and direct” result of the manufacturers’ conduct.\n\nWhat does each side argue?\n\nThe manufacturers and Mexico are represented in the Supreme Court by two of the top advocates before the nation’s high court. Noel Francisco, former solicitor general of the United States in the first Trump administration, is counsel to the gun companies. Catherine Stetson, partner in Hogan Lovells, is co-director of the firm’s national appellate practice and represents the Mexican government.\n\nStetson argues in her brief that the named gun manufacturers deliberately sell firearms that cartels prefer to so-called red flag dealers, “designing and marketing those firearms in ways they know cater to the cartels.” For example, Stetson wrote that they include “Colt’s special-edition handguns like the Super ‘El Jefe’ pistol, a term used to refer to cartel bosses, and the ‘Emiliano Zapata 1911’ pistol, which comes engraved with the Mexican revolutionary’s dictum: ‘It is better to die standing than to live on your knees.’”\n\n“The criminal market is ‘a feature, not a bug’ of Petitioners’ sales practices,” Stetson wrote, noting that the annual value of her opponents’ guns trafficked into Mexico is well over $170 million.\n\nBut Francisco counters that Mexico’s alleged injuries “all stem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals” and so the government’s lawsuit is barred by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n\nAiding and abetting, he writes in his brief, requires “an affirmative act taken with intent to help a crime succeed.” Mexico’s aiding and abetting theory fails, he contends, “where a lawful industry does nothing but engage in routine business practices.”\n\nThe justices are asked: Did the manufacturers sued by Mexico aid and abet unlawful firearms sales when they allegedly knew that some of their products were being illegally trafficked, and were those sales a proximate cause of Mexico’s injuries?\n\nThat, he argues, “is not the sort of misconduct that can render its participants accomplices—even if … they are aware their products may be criminally misused downstream. That rule controls here.”\n\nThe Mexican government’s theory of proximate cause also fails, he contends, because it “rests upon a medley of independent criminal acts, spanning an international border.”\n\nHe goes on to describe the chain of events: Gun manufacturers produce firearms in America, then sell them to licensed distributors who sell them to licensed dealers, some of whom, illegally or negligently, sell them to criminals. Some of these are smuggled into Mexico, a fraction end up with cartels, which use them to commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico’s government.\n\n“No court,” Francisco writes, “has ever found proximate cause on such a remote theory.”\n\nWhat to watch\n\nThe case comes to the justices on a motion to dismiss – a very early stage in the lawsuit. As seen in the large number of amicus briefs filed for both the gun makers and Mexico, it is being closely watched by the firearms industry, gun rights groups, gun law advocates and others.\n\nWhether the decision is a broad reaffirmation of the gun industry’s immunity under the federal law, or a narrow ruling that Mexico, as the lower appellate court found, had alleged sufficient facts to move forward with its lawsuit, will depend on how the justices define those two critical concepts of proximate cause and aiding and abetting in the federal law.\n\nREAD MORE: How Americans feel about Trump after his first month back in office",

Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America’s schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon “to put herself out of a job.”\n\nThe Senate voted to confirm McMahon 51-45.\n\nA billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut’s state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.\n\nMcMahon’s supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she’s unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.\n\n“Americans believe in public education,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said before the confirmation vote. “They don’t want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.”\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Trump’s blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department “operate more efficiently,” not to defund programs.\n\nWATCH: Linda McMahon pressed on Trump’s planned cuts to the Department of Education\n\nShe acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.\n\nWeeks before McMahon’s confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon’s allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.\n\nCreated by Congress in 1979, the Education Department’s primary role is to disburse money to the nation’s schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.\n\nTrump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America’s schools.\n\nSchools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference “diversity” or “equity” alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to close the department and grant its authority to states. Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public school budgets.\n\nAlready, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department’s work.\n\nTrump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as “woke” and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation’s academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.\n\nSome of the cuts have halted work that’s ordered under federal law. At her hearing, McMahon said the agency will spend money that’s directed by Congress, and she played down DOGE’s cuts as merely an audit.\n\nMcMahon is a longtime Trump ally who left WWE in 2009 to launch a political career, running unsuccessfully twice for the U.S. Senate. She has given millions of dollars to Trump’s campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nOn Friday, in the Oval Office, the president of the United States embarrassed himself, the nation, and every thinking human being on earth. He—and his vice president—berated Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in front of the press and public. Zelenskyy gave it right back to him, thank God, making it clear that he wouldn’t be bullied into accepting a “deal” produced by negotiations in which he had not been invited to participate. The president of the United States reacted like an angry child, repeatedly calling the Ukrainian president an ingrate, relitigating the whole mock “scandal” regarding Hunter Biden and Burisma, apologizing to Vladimir Putin for the mean things that people like “Shifty Schiff” said about him during Impeachment 1, and, eventually, lapsing completely into angry incoherence while Zelenskyy looked to be on the edge of decking him right there on the carpet. Zelenskyy left town without signing the mineral-rights deal that the president had sought so enthusiastically.\n\nPolitico called the episode “remarkable.” .\n\nTRUMP: You have to be thankful. You don’t have the cards. You’re buried there. Your people are dying. You’re running low on soldiers.... You’ve got to be more thankful, because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us, you don’t have any cards. It’s going to be a tough deal to make, because the attitudes have to change…. You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. And I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.\n\nVance chimed in like the good little lapdog he is:\n\nI think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.... Do you think it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that’s trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”\n\nMan, fck these people. I thought the Nixon tapes were the wildest things I’d ever heard out of the Oval Office.\n\nIt is considered axiomatic among cradle Catholics that adult converts are the worst. Too many of them are attracted to HMC because they have a sweet tooth for ancient ceremony, imperial pageantry, and really big hats. None of these plush accoutrements have the slightest thing to do with the teachings of a young rabbi in first-century Judea, of course, and I continue to subscribe to Garry Wills’s admonishment that Jesus did not create a papacy of any kind, let alone a garish and extravagant one. For that matter, he didn’t create an institutional church, let alone one with its own secret archives, its own library, and a collection of art that is second to none. Yet too many adult converts see all of this incense-stained filigree as the real message of the gospels. And the American members of the species are also particularly interested in political power and the means to acquire it. Newt Gingrich, for example, was one of them, as was Sam Brownback and the late Robert Novak. Their public activities never demonstrated an affection for the beatitudes or for the 25th chapter of Matthew.\n\n“Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’\n\n“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’\n\n“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ ”\n\nDoes that sound like the mission undertaken in public life by Vice President J. Divan Vance? Yeah, not to me either.\n\nOn Friday, he spoke to the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast, and we have entirely too many of these things that the elected officials of our secular republic are expected to attend. Vance went long on the whole victimization thing.\n\nI feel very confident in saying that between protecting the rights of pro-life protesters, between ensuring that we have an opportunity to protect the rights of the unborn in the first place, and importantly, protecting the religious liberty of all people, but in particular Catholics, I think that we can say that President Trump, though not a Catholic himself, has been an incredibly good president for Catholics in the United States of America.\n\nHe is, of course, the most upfront heathen ever to sit in the White House, a member of the Church of the Inverted Bible, but carry on, Second Banana.\n\nNow we know of course the last administration liked to throw people in jail for silently praying outside of pro-life clinics. We know that they like to harass pro-life fathers of seven, very often Catholic fathers, for participating in the pro-life movement. And we know that the last administration wanted to protect taxpayer-funded abortion right up until the moment of birth. On every single one of those issues, in 30 short days, Donald J. Trump has gone in the exact opposite direction.\n\nThe last part is an outright lie, and Vance knows it, and so do most of the people who showed up to eat waffles and pretend that they’re all not part of the Sanhedrin.\n\nAny list of great Gene Hackman performances that doesn’t include his spectacular—and uncredited—turn as the blind hermit in Mel Brooks’s Young Frankenstein is woefully incomplete. In it, Hackman demonstrated how brilliant he would have been in the 1930s and 1940s. (Part of this was the film’s gorgeous black-and-white photography. Hackman’s face looked like it came out of the great Eisenstein films Ivan the Terrible or Alexander Nevsky. He was the American Cherkasov.) And it is an incredibly funny couple of minutes in an incredibly funny film. I have missed him on the screen since his retirement, and his death this week came as a considerable shock, especially since the circumstances now seem to be quite weird. Maybe I should make an espresso?\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “I Ate Up The Apple Tree” (Pin Stripe Brass Band): Yeah, I still pretty much love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: March 1 is traditionally St. David’s Day, the feast of the patron saint of Wales. Here, from the 1910s, is the celebration. It seems to involve an impressive array of headgear. There is one little girl watching from the sidewalk, and she appears to be holding a footstool. I do not know what that’s all about. History is so cool.\n\nThis weekend is the 70th anniversary of John B. Keane’s pub, the great good place in Listowel in County Kerry. (My family comes from what we like to call the Greater Listowel Metropolitan Area. So do a great many sheep.) On my first visit there, Mr. Keane, the famous author and playwright, was working behind the sticks himself. He chatted me up about what I was doing in town, and he pulled me a pint. He then refused payment. “You’re a writer,” he explained. “You have no money anyway.” I’m sure the craic will be running high this weekend. My kingdom for a personal jet.\n\nHere’s some stupid for lunch. From Politico:\n\nThe order, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Friday and confirmed by a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly, marks the first time the U.S. will have an official language at the federal level.\n\nIt rescinds a mandate from former President Bill Clinton, left in place by each subsequent administration, that required agencies and other entities with federal funding provide language assistance to non-English speakers.\n\nNow, the White House says it is “unifying the American people” under the most common language.\n\nYeah, I look to these jamokes for unification at all times.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found. From Popular Mechanics:\n\nAccording to a translated statement from Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism & Antiquities, a multi-year archaeological projected named “Reviving the Ancient City of Gold” has revealed the ancient gold mining operation. And the project didn’t stop at just finding the site.\n\nMohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that the remains of a 3,000-year-old gold processing complex—which included a fully equipped facility for extracting gold from quartz veins and featured grinding and crushing stations, filtration and sediment basins, and ancient clay furnaces designed for smelting gold to create a pure product—showed off the highly orchestrated nature of the mining operation.\n\nTo make it all possible, gold miners eventually had an entire residential district on site. This space featured houses, workshops, temples, administrative buildings, and Ptolemaic Period bathhouses. Khaled said that the team identified architectural remains from both the Roman and Islamic periods. The evidence of the use of this space well after the creation of the initial encampment shows that it remained a popular option for multiple people groups.\n\nThe Branson of ancient Egypt! With gold mining! Steve Wynn is building a time machine as we speak.\n\nHey, Live Science, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nMegaraptorids were a group of fearsome predators in the Cretaceous period (145 million to 66 million years ago). They lived in the ecosystems of Australia and South America, which were joined together via Antarctica as part of a massive southern landmass called Gondwana.\n\nStudy lead-author Jake Kotevski, a paleontology doctoral candidate at the Museums Victoria Research Institute and Monash University in Australia, described megaraptorids as a “hands first predator” with muscular forearms and long, curved claws for catching prey—they effectively bring their prey in for a “hug of death,” he said in a video released by Museums Victoria.\n\nThe fossils discovered by Kotevski and his colleagues belonged to an unspecified 120 million-year-old megaraptorid that was 20 to 23 feet (6 to 7 meters) long—making it one of the largest theropods (a bipedal group of mostly meat-eating dinosaurs) ever discovered in Australia. It also predates megaraptorids in South America by around 30 million years.\n\nI am still grooving on the whole notion of “the hug of death.” They just couldn’t help living then to make us happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, with winter coming on, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

        "content": "On Monday, when the United States lined up with, among others, Russia, Israel, Equatorial Guinea, and Burkina Faso in selling out Ukraine at the United Nations, you may have wondered why Elise Stefanik, whom El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago has nominated to be the U.S. ambassador to the UN, was AWOL and therefore not available to collect the 30 pieces of silver. The answer, of course, is that the Republican Party, root and branch, is run by bungling stumblebums. From The New York Times:\n\nMr. Johnson is under pressure this week to hold his fractious conference together to pass a budget resolution, with potentially only a single vote to spare. Ms. Stefanik, a former member of House leadership, is a team player whose support could be crucial, given the difficult math.\n\n“If we get the budget resolution passed this week, which is the plan, then it’s possible that Elise Stefanik would go ahead and move on to her assignment at the U.N. as the ambassador there,” Mr. Johnson said on Monday during a talk at the America First Policy Institute. It was a blunt acknowledgment of the political reality of trying to pass a budget to enact President Trump’s agenda after he raided the House Republican ranks to fill out his administration.\n\nGenius, I tells ya.\n\nThe president either doesn’t know or doesn’t care—and my money, always, is on the former—that his majority in the House is wafer-thin. So he plucks Stefanik, a moderate turned slavish Trumpian Swiss Army knife, out of the House to install at the UN, narrowing Speaker Moses’ majority even more with a budget bloodbath looming in the Congress. So Johnson refuses to let Stefanik resign until after she is confirmed in her new job and until after he gets his budget passed.\n\n“I had 220 Republicans and 215 Democrats, and then President Trump began to cull the herd,” Mr. Johnson said. “We have a one-vote margin now—smallest in history, right? So for a big chunk of the first 100 days of the Congress, and perhaps beyond, this is not an easy task, but we’re going to get it done.”\n\nEven with Ms. Stefanik on hand and in support, it is not at all clear that Mr. Johnson will be able to pass the budget measure, with several Republicans signaling concerns about the plan. Nor is it certain when Ms. Stefanik, who declined to comment for this article, may be cleared to move on to her next job.\n\nMeanwhile, back in New York, against considerable odds, the state’s Democrats have their act together. They are in no hurry to have New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, set a date for a special election, which Hochul doesn’t have to do until Stefanik formally resigns her seat, which Speaker Moses can’t let her do. And around and around we go.\n\nGovernmentin’ is hard, people.",

The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

Bailey II, 1962\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was a great fan of this novel. He even arranged for the eventual movie to be filmed partly on the White House grounds. He had good reason for his enthusiasm for a potboiler set in Washington about a military coup by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He clashed repeatedly with his own restive JCS, and his intelligence community was a roiling ball of snakes. It was in 1962 when the Bay of Pigs invasion collapsed that JFK became convinced the military and the spooks had sold him a bill of goods. It was in 1961 when he negotiated a peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis, establishing along the way a line of communication with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev that, a year later, would lead to a comprehensive atmospheric nuclear-test-ban treaty, an event with a striking similarity to the disarmament treaty that was the central pivot in the novel.\n\nSunday night on his Countdown podcast, Keith Olbermann summoned up Seven Days in May in response to the startling news late Friday night that the president had decapitated the Joint Chiefs, firing chairman General C.Q. Brown Jr. and replacing him with retired Air Force lieutenant general Dan “Razin” Caine, probably because the president has a childish sweet tooth for people who flatter him and have really cool nicknames. Given the fact that Brown is Black, and also given that Trump has clear-cut nearly all the women in positions of high military command, much of the commentary on the firings has centered on making it part of the administration’s racist and sexist fanaticism regarding DEI programs. Which admittedly makes a lot of sense, since Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth already has tagged Brown with being a DEI hire. From The Guardian:\n\nAlthough Hegseth had been meeting regularly with Brown since the former Fox News host took over the top Pentagon job last month, he had openly questioned whether Brown had been named chair because he was Black. “Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt—which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter,” Hegseth wrote in one of his books.\n\nBut beneath the clamor, there were other troublesome firings. Along with the command personnel, the administration also fired the judge advocates general for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Hegseth’s rationale for the JAG firings made the situation even more ominous. From Law and Crime:\n\n“We want lawyers who give sound constitutional advice,” Hegseth told Shannon Bream on “Fox News Sunday” in response to the firings of three judge advocates general aka “JAGs” for the Army, Navy and Air Force. “And don’t exist to attempt to be roadblocks to anything that happens in their spots.”\n\nI see two problems with this answer, and I’m not comfortable with either one. First, I wouldn’t trust this administration to hire a lawn-service company, let alone staff a government. Hell, Hegseth himself is proof enough of that. The other answer was best summed up by Georgetown law professor Rosa Brooks in an Xweet:\n\nIn some ways that’s even more chilling than firing the four stars. It’s what you do when you’re planning to break the law: you get rid of any lawyers who might try to slow you down.\n\nHegseth was replying to that Xweet when he burbled that bafflegab about “roadblocks.” It called to mind the late Lewis Grizzard’s explanation of the difference between naked and nekkid: “Naked means you ain’t got no clothes on. Nekkid means you ain’t got no clothes on and you up to something.”\n\nIf you fire the people in charge of telling you that you’ve asked the military to do something illegal, it makes it seem like you might be up to something ... illegal. Like, say, performing domestic policing in times of mass protest. That would be raising some Cain, by God.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "For a number of years in the early days of this shebeen, we were plagued by the antics of Human Bowling Jacket Paul LePage, who kept getting elected governor of Maine because the state’s Democrats could never get their shi... act together. In 2022, however, the skies cleared and the angels wept. After the term-limited LePage had had to sit out for four years, he returned to challenge incumbent Democratic governor Janet Mills, who beat LePage like a tin drum, winning more votes than any gubernatorial candidate in the state’s history and probably ridding the political terrarium of one of its more noxious weeds. (Why the state’s Republicans decided to nominate the Human Bowling Jacket again is an indication that the prion disease has established itself within the Republican population of Maine. I suggest a quarantine until we find out what the hell is going on.) That victory is a sufficient political mitzvah for an entire political career. But the other day, Mills did the republic another great, good service.\n\nPresident Krasnov dropped by a National Governor’s Association meeting and spent an hour mumbling and maundering in the usual manner on a couple dozen issues about which he has less of a clue than a lamppost does. But at the end he decided to pick on Janet Mills. The subject was his idiotic campaign against trans citizens, the one that keeps getting turned into sticks and splinters every time a judge gets to rule on part of it. Under Mills, Maine has maintained its enlightened attitude toward its trans citizens. And awaaaaaaay we go!\n\n“Two weeks ago I signed an executive order banning men from playing in women’s sports. Many Democrats are fighting me on that. I hope you continue because you’ll never win another race. And it’s just crazy—if you look at what happened with the boxing, if you look at what happened with the weightlifting numbers, where a record that hadn’t been broken for 19 years got shattered, but you know they put up an eighth of an ounce here, an eighth of an ounce there, and it’s 218 pounds or whatever, a lot, and it hadn’t been broken in 19 years, and then the guy walks up, he transitioned, he transitioned, and he knocked out that record by about 100 pounds. That will be a record that’s not going to be broken again. So we put a ban on it—to protect women. I mean the women, if you watch the Olympics, you had two transitioned people that were fighting in the women’s boxing. They have women’s boxing category, and if you saw that, it was brutal. What happened to the Italian woman was a really good boxer, after one punch she said, ‘No, no, no more, no more.’ It was a left, it was not even a—it was just a left jab and she got hit so hard she said, ‘I can’t do it.’ They forced her to go out, No, go out, go out again, you’ll do it, goes out again, gets hit again. ‘No, no, that’s it,’ she didn’t want to die, and it’s crazy, but the NCAA has complied immediately by the way. That’s good, but I understand Maine, is the governor of Maine here?”\n\nI’m here, Mills replied.\n\nTrump: “Are you not going to comply with it?”\n\nMills: “I will comply with the state and federal law.”\n\nTrump: “Well, I’m, we are the federal law.”\n\n[I needed to pause for a moment because common sense got caught in my throat. We continue.]\n\nTrump: “Well, you’d better do it. You’d better do it. Because you’re not going to get any federal funding at all if you don’t. And by the way, your population, even though it’s somewhat liberal, although I did very well there, your population doesn’t want men playing in women’s sports. So you better comply. Because otherwise you’re not getting any federal funding.”\n\nMills: “I’ll see you in court.”\n\n[You can almost feel the feral energy from behind that podium. Who was this ... woman to be challenging the father of the new Golden Age of America? Why do they laugh at his mighty sword?]\n\nTrump: “Good, I’ll see you in court, good. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one. And enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics. Every state has a responsibility to comply with Title IX. They have an obligation, a legal obligation, and we will be enforcing aggressively, and we’re going to be protecting our citizens. We’re going to protect.”\n\nHere is where we remind everyone that this guy is the 1962 Mets of federal litigation. As soon as he got back to the Diet Coke room in the White House, however, he put the wheels of the crazy machinery in full motion. First, the Department of Education announced a Title IX investigation of Maine’s state DOE. In quick succession, the Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine’s Title IX compliance. The USDA has some alleged standing because UMaine, as a land-grant university, gets USDA money. The problem, of course, is that this money is already appropriated and approved, and impoundment by the executive is still unconstitutional, a point that Mills made in response to the investigation.\n\nNo President—Republican or Democrat—can withhold Federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will. It is a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold. Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his Administration, but we won’t be the last. Today, the President of the United States has targeted one particular group on one particular issue which Maine law has addressed. But you must ask yourself: who and what will he target next, and what will he do? Will it be you? Will it be because of your race or your religion? Will it be because you look different or think differently? Where does it end? In America, the President is neither a King nor a dictator, as much as this one tries to act like it—and it is the rule of law that prevents him from being so. I imagine that the outcome of this politically directed investigation is all but predetermined. My Administration will begin work with the Attorney General to defend the interests of Maine people in the court of law. But do not be misled: this is not just about who can compete on the athletic field, this is about whether a President can force compliance with his will, without regard for the rule of law that governs our nation. I believe he cannot.\n\nWhy does she laugh at his mighty sword?",

        "content": "Hey, we may experience a historic first, thanks to the ineffable wisdom of the American people, the oldest of whom may well be facing the FO portion of their likely truncated golden years. From CNBC:\n\nSocial Security has never missed a benefit payment since the program first began sending individuals monthly benefits more than eight decades ago. But the recent actions at the U.S. Social Security Administration by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency are putting monthly benefit checks for more than 72.5 million Americans at risk, former commissioner and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley told CNBC.com. “Ultimately, you’re going to see the system collapse and an interruption of benefits,” O’Malley said. “I believe you will see that within the next 30 to 90 days.” Ahead of any interruption in benefits, “people should start saving now,” O’Malley said.\n\nEighty years, and not a single missed payment. Now that’s what I call an efficient government service. If I were running a fake Cabinet operation that allegedly dealt with government efficiency—and, I mean, it’s right there in the fake Cabinet organization’s name—I would point to Social Security as the beau ideal of a government program. Not one missed payment. Ever. Praised be FDR and blessed be his name.\n\nElon Musk has decided the whole system is “a Ponzi scheme.” This, again, is an old conservative talking point that heretofore has been considered largely debunked by the eight decades of success of the program. Plus, it radically misunderstands what a Ponzi scheme actually is. We here in the Commonwealth (God save it!) can explain, proud as we are of our boy from School Street in Boston who got himself famous.\n\nMusk and the DOGE and Pony Show have threatened Social Security’s perfect record in the traditional Republican fashion, except with an extra-volatile flamethrower. Used to be that the Republicans would try to kill a program by appointing someone opposed to the program’s fundamental mission to run it. (The Reagan people were very good at this—James Watt at Interior, Anne Gorsuch at EPA, etc.) This administration has gone several steps further down the line. It has created what is essentially a hit squad of postadolescents in cargo shorts to clear-cut the executive branch, firing enough people to whittle down any agency’s ability to do a proper job for its clients. Those clients then become frustrated and lose faith, first in the agency and then in the government. This is where the privatizers come in like real estate sharpies when property values get set up to go down. That’s how they’re going to come for Social Security, which works too well to survive, I guess.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Let me be clear. This is my fight. From The New Republic:\n\nBut one downsizing just started attracting notice among insiders at the National Institutes of Health, because it seems particularly inexplicable: According to people familiar with the situation, approximately one-tenth of the workers have now been let go at the NIH’s Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias, or CARD, including its incoming director, a highly regarded scientist credited with important innovations in the field.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, at a meeting inside CARD’s building at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, employees were informed that a sizable swath of the center’s workers were being fired, according to an employee who was at the meeting. One of those being dismissed, the source says, is Kendall Van Keuren-Jensen, who had been tapped to eventually become CARD’s acting director, replacing the current director, Andrew Singleton, who is reportedly set to depart.\n\nWe are so very close. Maybe not to a cure but to the ability to arrest the progress of the disease so that it becomes a chronic condition that can be managed with medication while research toward a cure can go forward. Unless, of course, a bunch of postadolescents in cargo shorts come in and scramble all the work being done because breaking things is fun, dude.\n\nThe firing of Van Keuren-Jensen, CARD’s incoming director, is seen as particularly damaging to the cause by people familiar with the situation. They describe her as a leading researcher in the Alzheimer’s field, including when it comes to innovations enabling early detection of the disease. They note that CARD worked hard to recruit her, and while she can be replaced, they say her hiring would have enabled the center to make great strides in the field that are now in doubt. The other firings, which include senior researchers in the field, will also put those advances at risk, those people say.\n\nForty years ago this May, my father drove to pick up geraniums to plant on the family graves. The flower store was about a half mile away from his house. The next we heard of him was several days later, and he was in Montpelier, Vermont. That was my introduction to the disease that would clear-cut the generation before me, claiming not only my father but also all four of his siblings, and that has hung over me for four decades the way it has hung over millions of my fellow citizens. I have no sympathy for all the Republicans who now express dismay over what is being done to millions of their constituents, who now express dismay that the federal grant money that enriched their home states’ universities and who will continue to express this dismay as the assault continues, but who run like rabbits at the first sign of pushback. Gabe Sherman at Vanity Fair has an interesting report on how many of the Republicans in Congress are intimidated into voting for policies they know are wrong. Tough. These are the times that try men’s souls, as old Tom Paine once said. Do the right thing or get the hell out. There are people dying out there.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "On Thursday, the Trump administration said it intended to terminate 5,800 USAID contracts. Ebola control? Poof. Malaria control? Gone, baby, gone. In addition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off on portions of the cuts in apparent defiance of federal law regarding money already appropriated by Congress. So I ask in all seriousness, what would be the punishment if you held him in contempt? I mean, Cabinet officials don’t have that John Roberts blessed immunity, do they? And hell, a lot of people who work in the White House—including the president—don’t even seem to like him very much. But meanwhile, the chaos continues unchecked.\n\nIf, somehow, the Nine Wise Souls forget their part in the farce, the president simply will ignore their ruling and keep on keeping on, barreling through whatever loophole he and President Musk can contrive. The reason I know this is that he’s already doing it, and Citibank seems to be on board with it. From The Washington Post:\n\nAt issue are $20 billion in grants under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program established in President Joe Biden’s signature 2022 climate law. The fund seeks to leverage public and private dollars to invest in clean-energy technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps and more, including through community lenders in low-income areas. The Trump-appointed EPA administrator has alleged publicly that the money was awarded with little oversight and said the agency would try to claw back the money from Citibank, which was tasked with disbursing the funds.\n\nAbout the same time Rubio was seemingly giving the go-ahead to putting the kibosh on over 90 percent of the country’s foreign-aid budget, out in California, federal judge William Alsup was going upside the president’s melon on the subject of the wholesale firings of federal employees. From The New York Times:\n\nThe ruling, by Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California, stopped short of ordering a halt in the firings and added to the confusion for federal employees, who have been rattled by the mass firings in recent days.\n\nBut Judge Alsup found that the government’s human resources division had exceeded its authority when it issued a pair of memos outlining steps to fire an estimated 200,000 probationary workers.\n\nThat division, the Office of Personnel Management, is meant to guide agencies but not order them to take action, he said. But government agencies responded to the O.P.M. memos with sweeping firings, a first step in the drastic overhaul of the federal bureaucracy President Trump promised to carry out alongside Elon Musk, a top adviser.\n\nJudge Alsup said the government must quickly alert the agencies whose employees were involved in the lawsuit—including the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Science Foundation—of his finding that directives were illegal. He also ordered that the Pentagon be notified, despite it not being party to the lawsuit, expressing concern over news reports that firings there were imminent.\n\nHe indicated that while he did not believe he had the power to grant a more expansive restraining order requiring agencies to halt planned layoffs, he expected them to comply with the spirit of the law, based on his finding that any firings done at the urging of O.P.M. were unlawful.\n\nYeah, good luck with that, Your Honor.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, was quite a fellow. He was a judge. He was also a writer, an economist, a scientist, a historian, and a philosopher. He was one of the first to associate climate with the economics of nature. (France, you will not be surprised, was his ideal match of climate and economy.) In 1748, writing anonymously, he published a book called The Spirit of Laws. The book was a revelation, especially to young politicians in Great Britain and its American colonies. The Vatican was less enthusiastic; it put it on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a list that much later did not include, among other works, Mein Kampf.\n\nIn The Spirit of Laws, CLdS, BdLBedM (What is with these French names? Did they all carry business cards the size of road maps?), posits the theory of the separation of powers as a necessary construct for the preservation of liberty, an idea that John Locke first had proposed in its rudimentary form. Montesquieu wrote:\n\nWhen in the same person or in the same body of magistracy the legislative authority is combined with the executive authority, there is no freedom, because one can fear lest the same monarch or the same senate make tyrannical laws in order to carry them out tyrannically. Again there is no freedom if the authority to judge is not separated from the legislative and executive authorities. If it were combined with the legislative authority, power over the life and liberty of the citizens would be arbitrary, for the judge would be the legislator. If it were combined with the executive authority, the judge could have the strength of an oppressor. All would be lost if the same man or the same body of principals, or of nobles, or of the people, exercised these three powers: that of making laws, that of executing public resolutions, and that of judging crimes or disputes between individuals.\n\nThis idea percolated vigorously in the mind of a rising Virginia politician named James Madison, who set about the task of designing a government for the United States that would not fall apart like an overcooked chicken the way the Articles of Confederation had. In Federalist 51, Madison’s debt to this long-dead philosophe is plain.\n\nBut the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others.… Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man, must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government.\n\nMadison set up an endless, but discreet, brawl between gentlemen. One institution would exist in tension with the other two, and each one would jealously guard its prerogatives. The experiment would work best if Congress reined in the executive, and the executive was the last safeguard against a legislature gone mad. (Like, for example, the current monkey-house presided over by Speaker Mike Johnson.) And the judiciary would keep an eye on both of them to make sure that the liberties of the people were not bargained away for some temporary political advantage. The Constitution is written as a set of boundaries for political conflict, a compendium of rules for fighting as surely as that set down by the Marquess of Queensbury.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that those rules, and the system that was designed to operate according to them, is in the process of complete collapse.\n\nIn Master of the Senate, the third volume of his monumental biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, Robert Caro provides some acerbic commentary on that august body. “Decades of the seniority rule had conferred influence in the Senate not on men who broke new ground but on men who were careful not to,” he wrote. “It wasn’t outside forces that kept the Senate inefficient.… It was the Senate itself.”\n\nCaro explains vividly how Senate majority leader LBJ shook that institution out of its lethargy, especially on the issue of civil rights. In doing so, he brought the Senate back to its proper method of operation. Yes, it is supposed to be the thoughtful check on the wild kingdom of the House, but it is not supposed to be the place where legislation goes to die of neglect. It must assert its power and not run from it.\n\nRight now, separation of powers is in an appalling place. The executive is run by a dotty old autocrat who is populating his administration with slavish devotees, a madman begetting more madmen, as Starbuck cries into the storm battering the Pequod. The legislature has rubber-stamped dreadful Cabinet employees. And the Supreme Court has abandoned its own precedents hand over fist. I have lived through the imperial presidency days, but this is something worse. Both the Congress and the court have lost the stomach to fight for their own constitutional prerogatives. The old saw about how liberals are people who won’t take their own side in an argument applies even more to the current Congress and the current Supreme Court.\n\nThe pivot point, for me, anyway, came on February 13, 2021. On that day, the Senate voted to convict Donald Trump on charges that he’d incited the insurrection of a month earlier. But the vote was 57–43, short of the two thirds necessary to prevent him by law from running for federal office ever again. Trump was already out of office. There was absolutely nothing he could do to the Republicans whose lives he’d endangered on January 6, 2021. But Mitch McConnell declined to whip Republican votes for the impeachment resolution. And his statement on the floor of the Senate after the resolution passed is a masterpiece of pettifoggery, evasion, and the kind of surrender that diminishes the Senate as an independent institution.\n\nMcConnell spent several minutes excoriating Trump and, yes, fixing the blame for the insurrection squarely upon him:\n\nA mob was assaulting the Capitol in his name. These criminals were carrying his banners, hanging his flags, and screaming their loyalty to him. It was obvious that only President Trump could end this. Former aides publicly begged him to do so. Loyal allies frantically called the administration. But the President did not act swiftly. He did not do his job. He didn’t take steps so federal law could be faithfully executed and order restored. Instead, according to public reports, he watched television happily as the chaos unfolded. He kept pressing his scheme to overturn the election!\n\nEven after it was clear to any reasonable observer that Vice President Pence was in danger … even as the mob carrying Trump banners was beating cops and breaching perimeters … the president sent a further tweet attacking his vice president. Predictably and foreseeably under the circumstances, members of the mob seemed to interpret this as further inspiration to lawlessness and violence.\n\nLater, even when the president did half-heartedly begin calling for peace, he did not call right away for the riot to end. He did not tell the mob to depart until even later. And even then, with police officers bleeding and broken glass covering Capitol floors, he kept repeating election lies and praising the criminals. In recent weeks, our ex-president’s associates have tried to use the 74 million Americans who voted to reelect him as a kind of human shield against criticism. Anyone who decries his awful behavior is accused of insulting millions of voters. That is an absurd deflection. Seventy-four million Americans did not invade the Capitol. Several hundred rioters did. And 74 million Americans did not engineer the campaign of disinformation and rage that provoked it. One person did. I have made my view of this episode very plain.\n\nWhat followed was a “But…” that you could hear in the Yukon.\n\nBut our system of government gave the Senate a specific task. The Constitution gives us a particular role. This body is not invited to act as the nation’s overarching moral tribunal. We are not free to work backward from whether the accused party might personally deserve some kind of punishment.… If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge. By the strict criminal standard, the president’s speech probably was not incitement. However, in the context of impeachment, the Senate might have decided this was acceptable shorthand for the reckless actions that preceded the riot. But in this case, that question is moot. Because former president Trump is constitutionally not eligible for conviction.\n\nThere is no doubt this is a very close question. Donald Trump was the president when the House voted, though not when the House chose to deliver the papers. Brilliant scholars argue both sides of the jurisdictional question. The text is legitimately ambiguous. I respect my colleagues who have reached either conclusion. But after intense reflection, I believe the best constitutional reading shows that Article II, Section 4 exhausts the set of persons who can legitimately be impeached, tried, or convicted. The president, vice president, and civil officers. We have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen.\n\nThis pious dereliction is made even funnier in light of the decision of the Supreme Court conferring immunity on former presidents for crimes they may have committed in office. It has been a long, slow slide toward the current catastrophe, and nobody who was in a position to stop it cared even to try. Part of this collapse is due to careerism, but most of it can be attributed to fear. Vanity Fair ran a report this week that cited anonymous Congress-critters declaring themselves “scared shitless” to oppose nominees and policies they clearly know are wrongheaded and dangerous because of threats of actual physical violence from the president’s supporters. Which, believe it or not, brings us back to old Montesquieu again. In The Spirit of Law, he mused on the classification of political systems based on what he called an operating “principle” underlying each of them. For example, he wrote the principle underlying democratic republic is virtue, and the principle underlying monarchies is the love of honor. For despotisms, however, the underlying principle is fear. ’Twas ever thus.\n\nThis column originally ran in the weekly “Last Call with Charles P. Pierce” newsletter. Sign up here.",

Exodus, 23:1–2\n\n“I’m dedicating my life to being useful,” he says. “To my community, to my neighborhood, to my city. And to do that means letting go of some burdens of the past. Never forgetting, but forgiving. There is power in forgiving.”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\n\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "It looks like the Commonwealth (God save it!) in general, and Boston in particular, is about to get all up in the grill of Homeland Security bag of hot air Tom Homan. The city has declared quite clearly that it is not going to allow one of Homan’s beloved ICE dragnets to run amok in the streets of Boston. From WCVB-5:\n\nCommissioner Michael Cox, a Boston native, has been the leader of the Boston Police Department since he was appointed by Mayor Michelle Wu in 2022.\n\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Cox has faced several issues, including differences with President Donald Trump on how to handle immigration enforcement, diversity equity and inclusion within the BPD, keeping crime rates low and Boston safe, as well as strategies on recruiting new officers in the BPD.\n\n\n\nBPD officers are forbidden by state and local law from carrying out immigration enforcement. In recent weeks, ICE authorities have been seen taking people into custody.\n\n\n\nCox was asked if there is any conflict between local police officers and ICE agents when it comes to the subject of immigration.\n\n\n\n“The Boston Police Department has pretty defined rules, and we abide by the law here in the state, and we don’t enforce civil detainers regarding federal immigration law,” Cox said.\n\n\n\nCox was also asked how he navigates the difference between the city of Boston, state of Massachusetts and the U.S. federal government when it comes to the law.\n\n\n\n“What people don’t understand is there is a difference between criminal warrants and civil detainers,” Cox said. “Any criminal warrant is someone wanted outside the state, and if there is a warrant involved, we will absolutely enforce it, including federal ones, if there is a warrant involved, because we’re almost mandated to. But civil detainers are the defining line, that we just don’t do that because it’s immigration-related.”\n\nSpeaking at CPAC, Homan responded with the cool, academic reasoning that has been the hallmark of his entire public career. Of course, he wasn’t a ketamine-silly dude waving a chain saw around, so I guess that made him a moderate at CPAC. From The Patriot Ledger:\n\nWhile speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, Homan criticized Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox over an interview about the city’s policies on immigration issues.\n\n\n\n“I read a story last night: the police commissioner of Boston, you said you’d double down on not helping the law enforcement office of ICE,” Homan said. “I’m coming to Boston and I’m bringing hell with me.”\n\nOh, shut up, Tombstone.\n\n“I looked at the numbers this morning, I counted, I stopped counting at nine, nine child rapists that were in jail in Massachusetts, but rather than honoring an ICE detainer, released them back into the street.\n\n\n\n“You’re not a police commissioner, take that badge off your chest and put it in the desk drawer, because you became a politician. You forgot what it’s like to be a cop.”\n\nSeriously, put a sock in it. You stopped counting at nine? Did you have to take off your shoes to go on counting? Or, as Glinda says to the Witch of the West—oh, rubbish. You have no power here. See, we have a long history of dealing with bullshit warrants up here, dating all the way back to James Otis railing against the writs of assistance in 1761.\n\nAnd I take this opportunity to declare, that whether under a fee or not (for in such a cause as this I despise a fee) I will to my dying day oppose with all the powers and faculties God has given me, all such instruments of slavery on the one hand, and villany on the other, as this writ of assistance is.\n\nIt appears to me the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an English law-book.… Every one with this writ may be a tyrant; if this commission be legal, a tyrant in a legal manner also may control, imprison, or murder any one within the realm. In the next place, it is perpetual; there is no return. A man is accountable to no person for his doings. Every man may reign secure in his petty tyranny, and spread terror and desolation around him. In the third place, a person with this writ, in the daytime, may enter all houses, shops at will, and command all to assist him. Fourthly, by this writ not only deputies, but even their menial servants, are allowed to lord it over us. Now one of the most essential branches of English liberty is the freedom of one’s house. A man’s house is his castle; and whilst he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle. This writ, if it should be declared legal, would totally annihilate this privilege.\n\nThe only reason we have a transcript of Otis’s legendary arguments against the writs is that it charged up a young Boston lawyer to the point where he took down Otis’s closing argument. The young lawyers name was John Adams. Our ghosts can’t be underestimated.\n\n",

        "content": "Let us stipulate that anyone who makes a career in the electric television industry has a few synapses past the sell-by date. Sooner or later, the crazy people in charge will come for you. My advice? Make your pile and get out before they do. Otherwise the odds that things will end badly for you approximate those of your surviving crossing the Mojave Desert on roller skates in a wet suit.\n\nEven accepting all of that as axiomatic, what has happened at MSNBC in the past several days is such an orgy of bad faith and bad ideas that it may be an industry record in that regard. Joy Reid? Gone. Jonathan Capehart? Lost his show. Alex Wagner? Lost her show and demoted. Ayman Mohyeldin? Lost his show. (Apparently, the plan is to give Capehart and Mohyeldin their own new show. I’ll believe that right about when this alleged new show hits its first commercial break.) Hell, this is still the network that 86'd Melissa Harris-Perry and Tiffany Cross and the invaluable Mehdi Hasan in the dim and distant past. And it happened just as Lester Holt announced he was bailing as anchor of NBC Nightly News. NBC News and MSNBC are starting to look like Mississippi after the federal troops left in 1877. Let's go now to correspondent James Crow live from the White House.\n\nReid's dismissal was the earthquake. Its ratings were more than solid, as though ratings for political yak shows even matter. I am something of a special pleader in this regard. Time was when I was a semi-regular guest of Reid's, both on her nightly show and on the weekend show that came before it. Moreover, I count her as a friend. Her great gift on TV, besides her sense of humor—and she is as funny as whistling fish—was her uncompromising insistence that race is marbled throughout every major issue in American politics, as well as her ability to find voices that might otherwise never be heard on television. There is nothing more important in TV news than that, especially with the ongoing march to marginalization that is happening in this country generally.\n\nI confess I made a conscious decision not to watch any pundit shows on the morning after Election Day last November. There are always sports, or Turner Classic Movies, or some police procedural that can serve as wallpaper if I need it to do so. The whole cable-news genre seems so completely useless in the face of what's actually happening that it seems the equivalent of covering World War II through what was happening on Jack Benny's radio show. But the fact remains that Joy Reid is very, very good at hosting a political television show and that dumping her in such an unceremonial fashion is bad business. It's even bad television business, and that's unimaginable.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Tiger Beat on the Potomac’s bread and butter always has been stories of Democratic Party infighting. Bear in mind this is largely the fault of the Democrats, who are positively incontinent about airing their gripes with each other in public. (My modest Rules for Gracious Living include an iron prohibition against taking seriously any report that refers to “a longtime Democratic consultant/activist.” Please, God, strike these people dumb.) On Wednesday, however, they really did have an interesting one regarding Senator Professor Warren, by the grace of God ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee these days, and her continuing skepticism regarding the great crypto scam.\n\nDemocrats are barreling toward a new clash over cryptocurrency policy that could pit a growing cadre of industry-friendly lawmakers in the party against the left’s loudest voice on financial policy: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nPro-crypto lawmakers are moving quickly to advance long-sought legislation that would give new legitimacy to the digital assets sector—part of a Republican-led push to deliver on President Donald Trump’s pledge to turn the United States into the “crypto capital of the planet.” To make it happen, they are scrambling to get enough Democrats on board with industry-backed legislation to clear the Senate.\n\nIt will come as a surprise to absolutely nobody that there are Democrats on board already.\n\nSome on the left are already signing on, and it’s setting up a potential rift between crypto-friendly Democrats and Warren just months into the Massachusetts lawmaker’s tenure as the party’s new leader on the powerful Senate Banking Committee.\n\nThe push comes as part of a broad shift in Washington policymaking toward regulatory changes that could benefit the crypto sector. The industry, long dogged by scandals and concerns about financial fraud, is now being embraced by lawmakers and regulators who are eyeing changes that could help legitimize its $3 trillion market.\n\nWait. Let me catch up here. An industry that has been “long dogged by scandals and concerns about financial fraud” is now being “embraced” by elected officials who want to help “legitimize” the industry that has been “long dogged by scandals and concerns about financial fraud”? This is bananas.\n\n(Remember always another of the shebeen’s Rules for Gracious Living, which states that one should avoid people who say that they’ve invented new money.)\n\n“I have a very different experience with crypto and understanding of how it fits into our economy,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in an interview last month of his differences with Warren.\n\nGallego voted as a member of the House last year for an industry-backed crypto bill that Warren opposed. He said last month that he is “going to vote to represent what I think Arizona actually thinks about crypto and how it fits into the economy.”\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand is another one.\n\n“There’s a number of [Democratic] senators who do want to get involved in this space,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a pro-crypto New York Democrat who has helped write GOP-led digital assets legislation and is quarterbacking the efforts to get other members of her party on board.\n\nOne of SPW’s main concerns is the fact that crypto seems like a Persian bazaar for money laundering and the other depredations of the international money-shuffling system.\n\nIt’s all coming together to present a major early test for how Warren, who has clashed fiercely with moderate Democrats in the past over financial regulation issues, will handle differences with others in her party in her new role as its leader on the committee overseeing Wall Street and crypto. She has warned that digital assets present risks to consumers and called for the industry to be subjected to tougher anti-money laundering standards.\n\n“I believe that Democrats understand the importance of consumer protections and anti-money laundering curbs in any new financial product,” Warren told reporters last week in response to questions for this story. “All we’re looking for is a level playing field between crypto and all of the other financial systems.”\n\nMe too. Of course, I can also refer back to the wisdom of former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, as expressed in the majority opinion in the case of Citizens United v. FEC.\n\nWe now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.… The fact that speakers [Editor’s Note: i.e., donors] may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt.… The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\n\nOf course not.\n\nBack to TBotP:\n\nCrypto is used by just a fraction of the U.S. population, but it has come to play an outsize role in American politics. That has been driven in large part by the industry’s political spending. Gallego is one of three Senate Democrats who benefited from spending by a super PAC network funded by crypto firms, which spent more than $10 million to boost his Arizona Senate bid. Now, that PAC group has replenished its war chest with more than $115 million ahead of the 2026 midterms. The money acts as both carrot and stick: It could benefit lawmakers facing competitive re-election campaigns in 2026 who back the industry’s goals—and it threatens those who don’t.\n\nNothing gets by these people.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "The MAGAfication of federal law enforcement became complete on Thursday when Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were the only two Republican senators with the cojones to vote against confirming rancid social-media flotsam Kash Patel as director of the FBI. His nomination passed, 51–49, outside of Pete Hegseth, the closest the Senate came to not buying one of these lemons. From The Washington Post:\n\nPatel, a former assistant public defender and federal prosecutor, has been a staunch defender of Trump’s in recent years. And while FBI leaders in the modern era have sought to keep some distance between themselves and presidents, Patel would appear to be the first director to have so closely allied himself with the commander-in-chief who appointed him.\n\nI’d correct the record to mention L. Patrick Gray, the guy that Nixon slotted in as acting director largely to bury the FBI investigation of Watergate, but damn, Washington Post, don’t make me nostalgic for the days of independent FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nPatel is independent if, by independent, you mean “independent of reality” or “independent of Constitutional prerogatives.” The man is a Q-anon-adjacent Trumper dedicated to defending this president from the demons that dance and sing in their own vengeful minds. And he has friends, too.\n\nAnd perhaps no group is happier than the coterie of suspended or former agents Patel has connected with in recent years. They call themselves “The Suspendables”: victims of what they deride as the FBI’s weaponization against conservatives, and say they were punished for political differences and whistleblowing. They’ve built an online following through podcast appearances, social media and conservative news outlets where they’ve trumpeted their complaints. Critics dismiss them as disgruntled ex-employees peddling unsubstantiated claims of political bias. Patel’s ties to them have only stoked the deep unease Democrats have expressed about his nomination.\n\nThis vote stoked my unease about what happened back in 2016 just before the election when the New York field office (allegedly) blackjacked James Comey into announcing the reopening of the probe into Her E-Mails. And I suspect my unease will be regularly stoked over and over again as long as this guy is in charge of the FBI. Stoked Unease is the order of the day.",

        "content": "I can almost understand the politics of the cult that has seized control of the American government. I can almost understand why Republicans in Congress believe that obeisance to the cult is necessary to their political survival so, therefore, I can almost understand why they voted en masse for the crew of the big ship of fools that is the current Cabinet. I even can almost understand the acceptance by so many powerful people that, to succeed in the current political climate as a Republican, an unprecedented level of self-degradation is required. (For an example of this, look at Secretary of State Marco Rubio, trying to melt into the upholstery while the president and vice president both jackass it up in the Oval Office last Friday. That was a man eating his own liver.) After almost a decade of this, and after conceding in my own mind that everything I’ve learned about this country is wrong—or at least outdated—I have come to almost understand all of these things.\n\nWhat I don’t understand is the fetishism, the bone worship. Okay, the red hats are a trademark. I get that. But the posters with our fat, wheezing, stumbling husk of a president as something between the Archangel Michael and He-Man? No, I don’t understand why anyone would pay good American greenbacks for that stuff. Pictures of white Renaissance Jesus, standing spectrally behind him while he kneels in prayer? The man is the most thoroughgoing heathen in the history of American politics. Who buys this shit? This, I do not understand. These people, I do not understand.\n\nNor do I understand the professional politicians who, not content simply to sign onto horrific policies that will come to disaster sooner than later, insist on catering to the fetishism of the cult at the risk of looking like the Bushmen in The Gods Must Be Crazy and their Coke bottle. For example, isn’t Rep. Joe Wilson infamous enough for one lifetime? He’s the guy who yelled, “You lie!” at President Obama during a joint session of Congress. Shouldn’t that buy him a lifetime’s worth of wing-nut street cred? Now, though, we find Wilson exploring new fringes of political insanity. From NDTV World:\n\nSouth Carolina Congressman Joe Wilson has proposed a novel idea—introducing a $250 bill featuring President Donald Trump’s face. This move, if approved, would make Trump the first living current or former president to be featured on US currency. Wilson’s proposal is reportedly a response to “Bidenflation,” a term used by critics to describe the surge in inflation during former President Joe Biden’s administration. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in mid-2022, the highest rate since the early 1980s. Critics argue that Biden’s policies, such as increased government spending and economic stimulus measures, contributed to the rise in inflation.\n\nI look forward to buying a banana at my local bodega and handing the dude behind the counter a $250 and telling him that’s all I have. He’ll get even by giving me my change all in quarters and I’ll need a semi to get home.\n\nAnd there’s already a bill introduced to Congress, proposed by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, to arrange for Trump’s face to be added to Mount Rushmore, although I’m not sure there’s enough room in the Black Hills for all the chins.\n\nIt long has been my contention that much of what we’ve seen from Trump is merely Reaganism turned up to 11. His 2024 campaign was little more than 1984’s “Morning in America” scam with more professional wrestlers. As for immortalizing El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago in stone, or memorializing him on money, what is that except a loud, lunatic version of the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, the effort by fans of ol’ Dutch to place a memorial to him in every one of the 3,000-odd counties of the United States? It’s partly why the guy who broke the air-traffic controllers union has the capital’s main airport named after him and why the apostle of small government has 3.1 million square feet of prime D.C. real estate dedicated to a building bearing his name.\n\nYou may not have noticed, but it’s likely that your governor issued a proclamation commemorating February 6 as Ronald Reagan’s birthday. There’s a Reagan Building in Wichita and another one in Harrisburg. He has a suite in a Denver hotel and elementary schools in Nebraska and Wisconsin. Alabama not only has a ballpark named for him but also a bust of him at a McDonald’s in Northport where Reagan stopped for lunch after an appearance at the University of Alabama in 1984. (Reagan had to ask an aide what to order.) So all we’re seeing from the likes of Wilson and Luna is an accelerated version of the Reagan project. Once I find someone who can break a 250, I might stop by and visit a couple.",

YouTube.\n\nTrump added it is possible Russian oligarchs could qualify for the gold cards, when asked by a journalist if those people would be eligible. “Yeah, possibly. Hey. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people,” he said.\n\nJust what this country needs—a wash-and-wear spin cycle for dirty rubles run out of the State Department.\n\nPlease, Mr. President. Do go on. Who are these very nice Volga Bagmen?\n\nAnd can we round them all up?

It was glitzy and tacky, and it functioned mainly so that Midwest pensioners could gussy up their photo albums with “We are there!” photos from the Sands or Caesars. Come to think of it, I wonder if the president had one of these?\n\nAnyway, these new things are going at $5M a pop, and I’m sure that neither the president nor his family business will profit by a dime from this scheme.\n\nTrump said sales of the new visa, a high-price version of the traditional green card, would bring in job creators and could be used to reduce the US national deficit.\n\nYes, and I am the Tsar of all the Russias.\n\nThe Republican president, who has made the deportation of millions of undocumented migrants a priority of his second term, said the new card would be a route to highly prized US citizenship.\n\n“A lot of people are going to want to be in this country, and they’ll be able to work and provide jobs and build companies,” Trump said. “It’ll be people with money.”\n\nSales of the cards would start in about two weeks, Trump added.\n\n“We’ll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards. We have it all worked out from a legal standpoint,” Trump added.\n\nWhat are the odds on that?",

        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nThe Eye of Sauron has found your mailbox, people. From The Washington Post:\n\nTrump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as this week to fire the members of the Postal Service’s governing board and place the agency under the control of the Commerce Department and Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to six people familiar with the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals. The board is planning to fight Trump’s order, three of those people told The Washington Post. In an emergency meeting Thursday, the board retained outside counsel and gave instructions to sue the White House if the president were to remove members of the board or attempt to alter the agency’s independent status.\n\nFor 250 years, the post office has been one of the best ideas Ben Franklin ever had. But not even Ol’ Bifocals could see far enough into the future to see that there would people who could find political advantage in inconveniencing massive slices of the population. Yet here we are, halfway down the slope to full privatization and, if our experience with that is any indication, opening the door to looting and profiteering and really bad service. Rural folks will get confirmation yet again that they are living in the FO part of FAFO. E-commerce will be in chaos. And, oh, yes, this is completely fcking illegal.\n\nTrump’s order to place the Commerce Department in charge of the Postal Service would probably violate federal law, according to postal experts. Another executive order earlier this week instructed independent agencies to align more closely with the White House, though that order is likely to prompt court challenges and the Postal Service by law is generally exempt from executive orders.\n\nAnd yes, Louis DeJoy, the Keith Richards of the federal bureaucracy, is still running things for now.\n\nThe biggest political news of the week, at least according to the shebeen’s lights, are the facts that a) the president’s poll numbers are headed down the Mariana Trench, b) President Musk’s numbers are going to beat his to the bottom, and c) their policies are all infinitely less popular than the both of them are. Out in the country, citizens are going to town-hall meetings expressly to beat up their Republican Congress-critters for enabling the bureaucratic bloodbath. All of this is breathing some welcome fresh air into the general political atmosphere.\n\nThat the Democratic party elites seem to be lagging behind this sudden burst of energy is no real surprise. Cultivated timidity is a tough monkey to shake. I give Bernie Sanders credit. He’s going out on the road to do town halls in places like Omaha and Iowa City the way he did when his 2016 campaign first got rolling. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been a regular Mother Jones on the stump. We are rapidly reaching the “lead, follow, or get out of the way” moment. Not to mention that, if his numbers continue to tank, the president may misplace the rest of his marbles, and who knows what may ensue then?\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Money Blues” (Bessie Smith): Yeah, I still pretty much love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1949, is a delivery of some $5 billion in Marshall Plan aid to western Europe, from back in the days when we believed in such things, as well as in having allies. Personally, I like the fact that the French guy drove his new American tractor home and that he didn’t hit the guy on the horse who clearly ran an Arret sign. History is so cool—and it’s also a good prod to the national conscience.\n\nThe 4 Nations hockey tournament was an aesthetic and financial success. However, Boston’s Charlie McAvoy may be out for a month or more with a shoulder injury, Sidney Crosby has a bum elbow that clearly affected his shooting, and reporter Emily Kaplan said that she was aware of several players who may not be in shape to play when the NHL season resumes. After the glow wears off, I suspect that several coaches and owners will be sharing second thoughts. Here’s El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago ruining what was a fine evening of puckball.\n\nI’ll be calling our GREAT American Hockey Team this morning to spur them on towards victory tonight against Canada, which with FAR LOWER TAXES AND MUCH STRONGER SECURITY, will someday, maybe soon, become our cherished, and very important, Fifty First State. I will be speaking before the Governors tonight in D.C., and will sadly, therefore, be unable to attend. But we will all be watching, and if Governor Trudeau would like to join us, he would be most welcome. Good luck to everybody, and have a GREAT game tonight. So exciting! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP\n\nCanadian PM Justin Trudeau was on his game with this response:\n\nYou can’t take our country—and you can’t take our game.\n\nGlorious and free.\n\n(By the way, both Wayne Gretzky and Tiger Woods have some ’splainin’ to do for hobnobbing with this president.)\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From Archaeology News online:\n\nIn October 2022, the team first found the tomb’s entrance and main corridor in Wadi Gabbanat el-Qurud, about 2.4 kilometers west of the Valley of the Kings. At first, archaeologists thought it might be a queen’s tomb because it was close to the burial places of Thutmose III’s wives and Queen Hatshepsut. But as they kept digging and studying the inscriptions on alabaster vessels in the tomb, they confirmed its true owner.\n\nDr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the inscriptions named Thutmose II as the “deceased king” and mentioned his wife, Hatshepsut. “This discovery is one of the most significant archaeological finds in recent years,” Dr. Khaled remarked. He pointed out that, before now, no funeral furniture linked to Thutmose II had been found in any museum worldwide, which makes this discovery especially valuable to Egyptologists.\n\nThutmose apparently was a utility pharaoh, although his wife was the sharp one and ascended to the throne when Thutmose kicked. She is famous to people of a certain age by being the person who bestowed the powers of Isis upon science teacher Andrea Thomas.\n\nHey, ScienceAlert, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nBetween 122 and 108 million years ago, the Australian landmass was much farther south than today. Victoria was positioned within the Antarctic Circle, separated from Tasmania by a vast rift valley rather than open sea.\n\nAnd how do we know this? Because ... dinos. That’s why.\n\nResearch over the past decade has revealed striking similarities between Australian and South American dinosaurs. These include megaraptorids with claws shaped like scythes, and small, fleet-footed elasmarian ornithopods. There were also armoured parankylosaurians and colossal sauropods. Our newly described fossils show that a bunch of different carnivorous dinosaurs seen in South America also thrived in the Cretaceous of southeastern Australia. Two shinbones provide the first evidence of carcharodontosaurs (“shark-toothed lizards”) in Australia. A third shinbone provides strong evidence for the presence of unenlagiines, a southern group of dromaeosaurs (“running lizards”). A fourth shinbone and two tail vertebrae with their chevrons, which are from a megaraptorid, represent one of Australia’s largest-known carnivorous dinosaurs.\n\nAnd, as we know, the shinbone is connected to the leg bone, and they all lived then to make us happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits.. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and by the crash in Washington, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, with winter coming on, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.\n\n",

        "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

        "title": "The Texas Attorney General Wants to Sex-Screen All NCAA Athletes Now",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Being our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where the good shepherd grieves.\n\nWe begin in Texas, Patient Zero for all bad conservative ideas, where Attorney General Ken (Clean Getaway) Paxton is presently suing the NCAA for its stance on trans athletes in collegiate sports. This week, in another filing, Paxton has announced he intends to extend the reach of small government into the human genome. Paxton, because he is a raving transphobe, believes that NCAA is not obeying the president’s executive order on women’s sports like every right-thinking raving transphobe should.\n\nThis whole frenzy is based on one trans citizen who plays volleyball for the women’s team at a school in the Mountain West Conference. Even Paxton admits in his latest filing that he has no evidence of other trans athletes anywhere else. From the filing itself:\n\nAlthough it is impossible to know the full extent to which biological men are competing in the NCAA’s “women’s” sports categories based on the NCAA’s lack of sex-screening procedures, upon information and belief, Blair Fleming is not the only one. Biological men have been, and will continue to, surreptitiously participate in “women’s” sports until the NCAA implements a procedure to screen the sex of student-athletes.\n\nAt which point Paxton runs his freak flag all the way up the pole.\n\nThe second avenue through which biological men will continue to participate in NCAA “women’s” sports categories is the NCAA’s loose definition of “sex.” According to the Amended TEP, a student-athlete’s sex is whatever “designation doctors assign to infants at birth, which is marked on their birth records.” Not only does this definition stand in stark contrast to President Trump’s February 5, 2025 EO (defining sex as unchangeable and determined at conception), but it leaves ample opportunity for biological men to alter their birth records and participate in women’s sports. Indeed, 26 states and the District of Columbia allow a person to alter the sex designation on their birth certificate purely through administrative procedures.\n\nStates’ rights, people.\n\nIn the steamy Freudian rain forest of Ken Paxton’s mind, men everywhere are changing their birth documents in order to dominate women’s volleyball across this great land and, ipso facto and res ipsa loquitur, the NCAA is committing fraud. His solution? The NCAA should be made to conduct genetic testing of all 520,000-plus of its athletes.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, and because the NCAA is engaging in, has engaged in, and is about to engage in, deceptive trade practices in violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, the State prays that the Court enter a temporary injunction ordering the NCAA to immediately begin screening the sex of student athletes (such as by screening for presence of the SRY gene) and prohibiting all males (as defined by President Trump’s EO) from participating in “women’s” sports categories, or alternatively, requiring the NCAA and its affiliates to immediately stop using the terms “women,” “female,” or “girl” (or any iterations of such terms) in connection with the advertising and marketing of its “women’s” sports teams, categories, competitions, tournaments, and championships, and for all other relief to which the State may be justly entitled.\n\n(The SRY gene is responsible for male sex development.)\n\nBesides being incredibly intrusive, and despite being nothing more than the outward manifestation of a manufactured paranoid frenzy, this testing will be prohibitively expensive. Features, people, not a bug.\n\nWe move along to Idaho, where much of the citizenry has allowed their brains to secede from the Union. Now it has come to general attention that doing the ol’ “Sieg Heil” has become all the rage in certain exercises in public rhetoric. However, even in Idaho, there seem to be limits. From Idaho News6:\n\nIn a widely shared video on Reddit, Hill was seen issuing two salutes in front of a screen showing President Donald Trump—which has been likened to the Nazi salute. Hill issued several apologies since the incident but formally resigned on Monday afternoon, just a few days after the video was initially posted.\n\nLook, people. Just don’t do the Hitler salute, in any context whatsoever, but particularly not in homage to our current president. Christamighty, can’t we at least agree on that? Or, if not, just cancel Memorial Day?\n\nWe skip on east to Indiana, where we are reminded that voter suppression never sleeps. From Bolts:\n\nIndiana may soon make voting much tougher for college students: Legislation banning the use of student IDs for voting passed the state Senate with near unanimous Republican support in early February and now sits with the GOP-run House.\n\n[A student voting-registration activist] told Bolts that banning student IDs at the polls would add a significant barrier for many students who want to vote. If a student who just moved to campus before a fall election can’t vote with their university ID, and doesn’t already have another ID issued by the state of Indiana, they’d then need to trek to the closest BMV office miles from campus and supply documents that can be tricky for students to obtain—all during a busy season of classes and midterms.\n\nIndiana would be the seventh state to require a photo ID at the polls while disallowing all student IDs, even if they’re issued by state colleges and universities, according to trackers maintained by the Fair Elections Center and by Voting Rights Lab. New Hampshire is currently debating a similar move.\n\nMoreover, it is of historical note that it was Indiana that really got the ball rolling on voter ID. In 2007, in a case out of Indiana titled Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, federal appeals court judge Richard Posner led a majority in upholding an Indiana law requiring IDs to vote. The Supreme Court upheld Posner’s decision, and that opened the floodgates. States with Republican majorities in their state governments soon began narrowing the sort of IDs they would require and began making those IDs harder and harder to obtain, especially for those likely to vote Democratic. In 2013, Posner shocked his fans by publicly denouncing his own opinion, saying flatly that the dissenters on his court had been right all along. From The New York Times:\n\nIn a new book, “Reflections on Judging,” Judge Posner, a prolific author who also teaches at the University of Chicago Law School, said, “I plead guilty to having written the majority opinion” in the case. He noted that the Indiana law in the Crawford case is “a type of law now widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.”\n\nAsked whether the court had gotten its ruling wrong, Judge Posner responded: “Yes. Absolutely.” Back in 2007, he said, “there hadn’t been that much activity in the way of voter identification,” and “we weren’t really given strong indications that requiring additional voter identification would actually disenfranchise people entitled to vote.” The member of the three-judge panel who dissented from the majority decision, Terence T. Evans, “was right,” Judge Posner said.\n\nThe dissent by Judge Evans, who died in 2011, began, “Let’s not beat around the bush: The Indiana voter photo ID law is a not-too-thinly-veiled attempt to discourage election-day turnout by certain folks believed to skew Democratic.”\n\nThanks, pal.\n\n(The good people at Bolts give us a neat survey of eight critical voting-rights cases on which we should all keep watch this year.)\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Seeker of Fresh Coke Zero’s Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of the new national order. From Oklahoma Voice:\n\nAs the Trump administration pushes for more deportations, the government has revived a long-abandoned program that lets local and state law enforcement challenge people on the street about immigration status—and possibly arrest them for deportation.\n\nSo far this week, state and county agencies in Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas have already signed up for the “task force” program that was dropped in 2012 after abuses including racial profiling were discovered, costing tens of millions in lawsuits. New Hampshire State Police will sign an agreement soon.\n\nMake no mistake. This is a bad idea. This is a bad idea made even worse by the fact that we tried it not long ago and it proved to be a bad idea.\n\n“They’re going to stop somebody for a routine traffic violation or loitering and ask about immigration status,” said Thomas Kennedy, a policy consultant for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, which represents 83 immigrant advocacy groups in the state.\n\n“That’s bad for civil rights, it’s bad for our community, for trust between law enforcement and the community, for the reporting of crimes. But it also exposes municipalities and police departments to litigation,” Kennedy said.\n\nIn Arizona, Maricopa County was forced to pay $43 million in litigation fees from lawsuits before ICE stopped its task force partnership with the county in 2009. The fallout from a 2013 federal court finding of racial profiling is expected to boost taxpayer costs to $314 million this year.\n\nA law that both violates civil liberties and drains the public treasury. If that isn’t the summation of American conservative governance, I don’t know what is—except, maybe, Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "My friend Adrian Walker is a columnist for The Boston Globe. His latest concerns the downstream effects of the current bureaucratic bloodletting in Washington. This is what you get when you turn “waste, fraud, and abuse” into conjuring words to make cruelty disappear.\n\nMike Slater survived four tours of duty as a US Army infantryman, risking his life in Iraq and Afghanistan. That wasn’t enough to spare him from the budget ax now being recklessly wielded at federal employees. He lost his job—helping war-scarred veterans in Central Massachusetts at the VA Veterans Center in Springfield—earlier this month.\n\nSlater, 42, had taken his daughter to a dance class and was thumbing through news sites on his phone when he ran across a piece saying firings were coming to the Department of Veterans Affairs. He didn’t think that much of it. “I got home, I checked my VA cell phone at 7 p.m. and I had the email saying that I had been terminated,” Slater told me.\n\nFour tours. Two each in both of the wars of choice launched by the previous Republican Worst President of All Time. Four tours. (As a bomb-disposal specialist!) And they fire him by email. These really are the mole people.\n\nWhen he got home, the Springfield VA was where he went to get put back together. The Veterans Center he worked in was part of a network established decades ago at the behest of returning Vietnam veterans. It is funded by the VA, but its facilities are separate and community-based. To this day, it serves clients suffering from PTSD or other combat-related trauma, including sexual assault. The Springfield Vets Center serves an estimated 600 veterans like Slater. When Slater got home from war, it was exactly what he needed. “I really wasn’t in shape to work, so I started going to the VA itself for counseling,” he said.\n\nOnce he was back on his feet, Slater went to work helping other veterans who were going through what he’d been through upon his arrival back in the world. Because that is what soldiers do for other soldiers.\n\n“I had an amazing counselor [at the VA], but she was a civilian. I had a really hard time connecting with her and talking to her, so she was like, ‘You know, I’d do this with you forever. But I just met this doctor and this outreach guy from the Vet Center, maybe you go down there and give it a shot and see what happens. So I went down to the Vet Center. I did all my group therapy at the Vet Center with other combat vets, while maintaining my individual counselor at the VA.”\n\nSlater gradually transitioned into a career as a respected counselor for returning veterans in Central Massachusetts. He was director of veterans services for the town of South Hadley when he got the opportunity to work in the center that had turned his life around. Though the change in jobs involved a significant pay cut, he couldn’t resist the chance to help a larger pool of returning veterans, in a place he felt indebted to.\n\nThere are thousands of Mike Slaters out there. They are forest rangers and accountants and firefighters and analysts and a hundred other things that are required to run a large democratic republic. And if the Democratic Party doesn’t put every damn one of them in a television commercial to explain what they do in the national interest, then the entire Democratic Party should be loaded into a SpaceX rocket and shot off toward the Kuiper Belt. If, as it happens, the SpaceX rocket should explode and rain down in the South Atlantic, well, that would be okay, too.\n\nJames Carville, for example, should be the first passenger on the rocket. Seat 1A. Give him a window.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Tell the truth. When was the last time you thought seriously about the United Nations and this country’s place in that body? I think the last time I thought seriously about the UN was when the late Colin Powell was there making his thoroughly mendacious case for invading Iraq. (Remember? Those mountains of bioweapons, those lagoons of poison, those huge billows of deadly gas, all those aluminum tubes! What a crock of beans that was.) On Monday, however, we got a sad reminder that the U.N. is still there and that the United States has decided to formalize what we’ve all known since 2015 or longer. :\n\nThe Trump administration, after seeking to tone down the language, voted against that resolution and introduced its own that simply called for an end to the conflict. Both measures passed, but in siding with Russia against most of its European allies, the United States made a sharp break with the past. The face-off at the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, the third anniversary of the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, was a remarkable public fissure between Western allies that have typically stood together when it comes to Russia and Europe’s security, demonstrating the sharp turn in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump.\n\nThat surely is a strange way to spell sellout.\n\nSo the U.S. puppy-dogged along with the kleptocratic thief of Crime in the face of every one of our European allies. And it did so by proposing an alternative resolution that was of a piece with the absurdity of the “negotiations” about ending the war in Ukraine to which the government of Ukraine is not invited. The U.S. resolution was the weakest of weak tea.\n\nThe U.S. resolution was three short paragraphs. It did not mention Russia’s aggression or condemn the invasion. It mourned the loss of life on both sides and said that the United States “implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.” ... The Ukrainian resolution was adopted by a vote of 93 nations in favor to 18 against, with 65 abstaining. The Assembly broke out into applause. Among the 18 countries that voted against Ukraine’s resolution were Russia, the United States, Israel, Hungary, Haiti, Nicaragua and Niger.\n\nWell, that’s a fine motley crew.\n\n“This is a moment of truth, a historic moment,” said Mariana Betsa, Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister. Addressing the General Assembly, she said the way it had voted in response to Russian aggression and war crimes would define the future of Ukraine and the free world. Dorothy Camille Shea, the interim chargé d’Affaires representing the United States, asked member states to commit to ending the war immediately. She said that previous U.N. resolutions that condemned Russia and called for it to withdraw its forces from Ukraine had failed to alter the course of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. “Those resolutions have failed to stop the war,” said Ms. Shea. “It has now dragged on for far too long, and at far too terrible a cost to the people in Ukraine, in Russia, and beyond.”\n\nThe position of the United States government on Russian aggression in Ukraine is so toweringly incoherent, and so thoroughly dishonest, that it validates any theories of Russians behind the administration’s curtain no matter how wild that speculation is. The sellout of Ukraine is well on its way to being one of the most disgraceful foreign-policy episodes since the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. This vote on Friday merely validated the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "And people say that our system is inefficient. Balderdash, says I. On Tuesday, three federal courts dealt out ass-kickings to the president in right around 90 minutes. Then, I suppose, everybody went to lunch or something. Two of the courts were in D.C. The other was in the state of Washington. The president lost on his spending freeze, his impoundment of foreign-aid money, and his executive order that suspended a refugee-settlement program. From CNN:\n\nMeanwhile, across the country in Washington state, a federal judge in Seattle issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday that halts Trump’s executive order suspending refugee admissions and funding.\n\nJudge Jamal Whitehead, who was also appointed by Biden, said that Trump’s “actions amount to an effective nullification of congressional will in establishing the nation’s refugee admissions program.”\n\n“While the president has substantial discretion to suspend refugee admissions, that authority is not limitless,” the judge said.\n\nTrump’s executive order, signed on his first day back in office, also directed a review of the refugee program and stated that resettlement should only resume if deemed to be in the “national interest”—a move critics argue is a de facto refugee ban.\n\nThe two D.C. judges were just as plain-spoken.\n\nIn DC, Judge Loren AliKhan issued a preliminary injunction that indefinitely blocks the administration from freezing federal grants and loans. The ruling expands an earlier block the appointee of former President Joe Biden issued last month shortly after the White House ordered the funding freeze.\n\n“In the simplest terms, the freeze was ill-conceived from the beginning. Defendants either wanted to pause up to $3 trillion in federal spending practically overnight, or they expected each federal agency to review every single one of its grants, loans, and funds for compliance in less than twenty-four hours. The breadth of that command is almost unfathomable,” AliKhan wrote in her ruling.\n\nJudge Amir Ali teed the president up on his having frozen the foreign-aid money.\n\n“We’re now 12 days in, and you can’t answer to me whether any funds you acknowledge are covered by the court’s order are unfrozen?” said District Judge Amir Ali. “You can’t give me any facts about funds being unfrozen?”\n\nDepartment of Justice lawyer Indraneel Sur told Ali he was “not in a position to answer.”\n\nYou will not be surprised to know that this triple legal homicide was not well received inside the hive-mind. Elon Musk was beside himself, which is two too many. President Musk’s study of The Federalist seems to have been somewhat superficial.\n\nWhat is the point of having democratic elections if unelected activist “judges” can override the clear will of the people? Well, that’s no democracy at all!\n\nIf ANY judge ANYWHERE can block EVERY Presidential order EVERYWHERE, we do NOT have democracy, we have TYRANNY of the JUDICIARY.\n\nOur unelected South African copresident sought comfort in cyber-flirting with the dictator of El Salvador.\n\nUnfortunately, as President Bukele eloquently articulates, there is no other option. We must impeach to save democracy.\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts. Please pick up your special parting gifts at the back of P.W. Botha Hall.\n\nTurns out that Musk didn’t need to go all the way to Central America to find support.\n\nCorrupt judges should be impeached. And removed. Pass it on if you agree.\n\nThat was Senator Mike Lee, the famous konstitooshunal skolar from the state of Utah, who has been dancing on a string since 2016 and who now, apparently, has two puppeteers instead of one. Lee also has proposed to jack around with the judiciary system so that it will be harder for the courts to check and balance the whimsical approach to executive power demonstrated by the current White House, as well as subordinate acts of Congress to presidential executive orders. From KSL:\n\nSen. Mike Lee is drafting legislation to limit judges from blocking executive orders.\n\nThe proposed bill requires a three-judge panel for nationwide injunctions, with appeals to the Supreme Court.\n\nBack in 2016, I watched as Mike Lee led a doomed revolt against the president’s first nomination on the convention floor in Cleveland. The revolt was crushed, ruthlessly, in the first indication that the Trump political operation had hijacked the institutional power of the Republican Party. From Politico:\n\n“I have never in all my life, certainly in six years in the United States Senate, prior to that as a lifelong Republican, never seen anything like this,” said Utah Sen. Mike Lee, one of the most prominent signatories to the push for a roll call vote. “There is no precedent for this in parliamentary procedure. There is no precedent for this in the rules of the Republican National Convention. We are now in uncharted territory. Somebody owes us an explanation. I have never seen the chair abandoned like that. They vacated the stage entirely.”\n\n“It’s coercion masking as unity,” Lee said later. “It may well be the case there were only 9 states that submitted the petition… if that’s the case, then it appears we did not satisfy the threshold,” Lee continued.\n\nIn the years since, Mike Lee has found ways to satisfy every threshold.",

For example, here’s Lee Zeldin, the former congresscritter and failed gubernatorial candidate from New York whom the administration put in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, seeking to rewrite science, which science will, of course, ignore, until Zeldin has to grow gills or die. From The Washington Post:\n\nThe 2009 “endangerment finding” cleared the way for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act by concluding that the planet-warming gases pose a threat to public health and welfare. The Obama and Biden administrations used that determination to set strict limits on emissions from cars and power plants.\n\nBy repealing the endangerment finding, the Trump administration would be taking one of its most consequential steps yet to derail federal climate efforts. In recent days, the administration has also blocked work that is central to international climate research and barred federal scientists and diplomats from attending a major climate event in China.\n\nThe endangerment finding has sparked legal and political battles in Washington for more than 15 years. In 2007, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. In response, the EPA first issued the endangerment finding and then established the first-ever carbon limits for vehicles and power plants.\n\nOccasionally, we try to remind people like Zeldin that nature doesn’t give a damn if you win an election—or if you win every election until time shall be no more. Science doesn’t give a damn if you win every argument on the pundit shows forever. The sea has its own interests, and if it becomes interested in establishing some beachfront property in West Virginia, it will act on its inexorable wishes. And nature, science, and the sea don’t give a damn what Lee Freaking Zeldin thinks any more than the measles virus cares what Robert Kennedy Jr. thinks. We are in the hands of the madmen.",

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "content": "Here is some stupid for lunch.\n\nAnd serving it up is Tail Gunner Ted Cruz, the Texas Tourist, who is now sufficiently MAGA that he’s probably got some AI-generated photos showing his father in a sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository on November 22, 1963. It seems that, inspired by the assault on the federal government by Elon Musk, the Tail Gunner has launched his own dragnet through the executive branch. The Tail Gunner’s probe produced a catalog of waste, fraud, and abuse, except it apparently was run by marmosets. From ProPublica:\n\nA few months ago, Sen. Ted Cruz announced that he had uncovered $2 billion of science grants funded by former President Joe Biden’s administration that prioritized “radical political perspectives” or “neo-Marxist theories.’’ His aides on a congressional committee assembled the list by searching the project descriptions for 699 key terms like “women,” “diversify,” “segregation” and “Hispanic culture.”\n\nWhen Cruz released the database of this allegedly “woke” research earlier this month, we decided to run our own experiment. We asked one of the models powering ChatGPT, which can sift through large amounts of data, to evaluate all 3,500 grant descriptions in the database as if it were an investigative journalist looking for Marxist propaganda, “woke ideology,” or diversity, equity and inclusion.... We found that Cruz’s dragnet had swept up numerous examples of scientific projects funded by the National Science Foundation that simply acknowledged social inequalities or were completely unrelated to the social or economic themes cited by his committee.\n\nThis highly scientific approach to data gathering has produced the inevitably hilarious results.\n\nAmong them, for example, was a $470,000 grant to study the evolution of mint plants and how they spread across continents. As best we can tell, the project ran into trouble with Republicans on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation because of two specific words used in its application to the NSF: “diversify,” referring to the biodiversity of plants, and “female,” where the application noted how the project would support a young female scientist on the research team.\n\nGive these intrepid gumshoes enough time and God alone knows what waste, fraud, and abuse they could find in the average issue of House & Garden.\n\nOther projects our AI assistant led us to included: developing a device that could treat severe bleeding. It seems to have caught the committee’s attention for using the words “victims”—as in gunshot victims—and “trauma.\"\n\nCreating biosensors to detect infectious diseases. The grant appears to have been tagged for the repeated use of “POC,” an acronym often used for “people of color” but in this context meaning “point of care”—that is, the place where people receive medical treatment—and “barrier,” referring to a part of the biosensor itself.\n\nDesigning eye-tracking technology for diagnosing and treating concussions. It appears to have gotten flagged for referencing “traumatic” brain injuries and the “status,” meaning the condition, of patients.\n\nGenius, I tells ya. Next, how recipes for “mince pie” advance the gay agenda.\n\nElsewhere, Elon Musk’s DOGE and Pony Show isn’t doing much better. It produced what it called a “wall of receipts” purporting to demonstrate how much WF&A its own sleuthing had uncovered. Except it reckoned without the indefatigable David Fahrenthold and his colleagues at The New York Times:\n\nWhile the DOGE team has surely cut some number of billions of dollars, its slapdash accounting adds to a pattern of recklessness by the group, which has recently gained access to sensitive government payment systems. Some contracts the group claims credit for were double- or triple-counted. Another initially contained an error that inflated the totals by billions of dollars. In at least one instance, the group claimed an entire contract had been canceled when only part of the work had been halted. In others, contracts the group said it had closed were actually ended under the Biden administration.\n\nDOGE since has deleted many of the erroneous claims made in the wall of receipts. But between DOGE’s wild inaccuracy and Cruz’s inability to tell mint plants from human beings, I think things are going awfully well, don't you?\n\n",

        "title": "What’s This, an Unexpected Spasm of Compassion and Good Sense from the Supreme Court?",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "On Tuesday, the Supreme Court, in an unexpected spasm of compassion and good sense, vacated the death sentence of an Oklahoma man named Richard Glossip. Glossip was convicted of hiring out the murder of his former boss at a local motel, and the primary witness against him was the guy who had pleaded guilty to actually committing the murder. Glossip’s trial was an abomination, as the facts about the prosecution that began leaking out over the 25 years that Oklahoma was vainly trying to kill Glossip ultimately indicated. From Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s majority opinion:\n\nAn Oklahoma jury convicted petitioner Richard Glossip of paying Justin Sneed to murder Barry Van Treese and sentenced him to death. At trial, Sneed admitted he beat Van Treese to death, but testified that Glossip had offered him thousands of dollars to do so. Glossip confessed he helped Sneed conceal his crime after the fact, but he denied any involvement in the murder.\n\nNearly two decades later, the State disclosed eight boxes of previously withheld documents from Glossip’s trial. These documents show that Sneed suffered from bipolar disorder, which, combined with his known drug use, could have caused impulsive outbursts of violence. They also established, the State agrees, that a jail psychiatrist prescribed Sneed lithium to treat that condition, and that the prosecution allowed Sneed falsely to testify at trial that he had never seen a psychiatrist. Faced with that evidence, Oklahoma’s attorney general confessed error. Before the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA), the State conceded that the prosecution’s failure to correct Sneed’s testimony violated Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959), which held that prosecutors have a constitutional obligation to correct false testimony. The attorney general accordingly asked the court to grant Glossip a new trial. The OCCA declined to grant relief because, it held, the State’s concession was not “based in law or fact.” Because the prosecution violated its obligations under Napue, we reverse the judgment below and remand the case for a new trial.\n\nSneed’s testimony was mainly all that the prosecution had on Glossip, and the prosecution’s finagling became so obvious that even Oklahoma’s attorney general, Gentner Drummond, asked the Supreme Court to vacate Glossip’s conviction, not merely to commute the death sentence but to toss the conviction entirely and order a retrial. In this, Drummond was joined by more than 60 members of the Oklahoma legislature, which never has been confused with an ACLU picnic. If the state tries him again, it will be wasting a whole lot of money.\n\nSo all’s well for Richard Glossip. But before leaving the case, we should take a closer look at the dissent by Justice Clarence Thomas, because Mr. Justice Thomas never has seen an execution for which he would not buy popcorn. His dissent was both bloodless in its reasoning and bloodthirsty in its effect. It began by denying that the court had any business hearing the case in the first place, and then it went on to completely exonerate the prosecution, giving what was clearly some evidentiary jiggery-pokery a pass entirely.\n\nEven framing the question as whether a correction could have affected the outcome of trial, the parties have not established materiality.\n\nFirst, irrespective of whether Sneed lied, prosecutorial correction of his testimony would not have led the jury to infer that he had consciously committed perjury. The far more plausible inference would have been that Sneed simply misremembered—like numerous other witnesses in the same trial. Recall that Glossip’s second trial took place seven years after the events in question and six years after his first trial. Many key witnesses in Glossip’s second trial testified in his first, leaving them open to impeachment on any details they remembered differently six years later.\n\nRegardless, there is no reason to think that disclosing Sneed’s bipolar disorder would have affected the outcome of the trial. Glossip’s defense team was well aware of Sneed’s condition and chose not to use it as impeachment evidence. As appellate judges examining a cold record 20 years after the trial, we should be wary of believing that we understand the import of evidence better than Glossip’s counsel. Moreover, the defense made no effort in its questions and argumentation to lay the groundwork for a theory that Sneed acted on a manic impulse. So, it is hard to see why the jury would have developed any theory on its own from a cursory mention of the condition.\n\nI call your attention to one remarkable sentence in Thomas’s dissent.\n\nFirst, irrespective of whether Sneed lied, prosecutorial correction of his testimony would not have led the jury to infer that he had consciously committed perjury.\n\n“Irrespective” of whether the witness on whom the prosecution hung nearly its whole case lied? And it seems to me that there’s a huge burden of proof on those prosecutors to prove they didn’t withhold the problems with Sneed’s testimony precisely so that the jury wouldn’t “infer” that Sneed committed perjury. But then again, I haven’t been screwing up America since 1991.",

        "content": "The shebeen has had its eyes on Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee for a while now, ever since he hit the Intertoobz with his Nativity narrative from the Gospel According to Armalite. And there is currently that messy business with the FBI and his campaign finances. And his résumé largely was science fiction. And there was the GoFundMe appeal that was supposed to be about a children’s burial garden. Despite all of this, Rep. Ogles is undaunted in his ability to look past the beam in his eye to imagine a speck of dust in someone else’s. From Bloomberg Law:\n\nIn a resolution posted on X on Monday, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) claimed Senior Judge John Bates of the US District Court for the District of Columbia engaged in misconduct and promoted a “grave moral evil” by ordering health agencies to restore certain webpages with health information and datasets.\n\nThe webpages were taken down under Donald Trump’s executive order to remove any agency statements that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.”\n\nOgles said in the impeachment resolution that Bates “failed to consider” that these webpages contained information about gender-affirming care, and “at no time in the history of the American judicial system, until very recently, would judges have considered the purposeful damage to the bodies of healthy young men and women to be a compelling or even legitimate health concern.”\n\nA “grave moral evil”? Seriously? I don’t trust any politician who starts sounding like Pius IX, but I particularly don’t trust one with Ogles’s impressive CV for shenanigans. Expect to see more of this as the president’s crackpot agenda keeps getting fungo’d into the cheap seats by the federal courts.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "A few years ago, I became fascinated with figuring out my Kibbe type. It started as idle curiosity, a casual glance into the ever-expanding world of aesthetic classification, but quickly turned into a puzzle that refused to be solved.\n\nFor the uninitiated, a “Kibbe type” refers to the style system developed by image consultant David Kibbe, first introduced in his 1987 book Metamorphosis. A former actor, Kibbe rejected the era’s rigid beauty standards in favor of a more holistic approach—one that considered not just body shape but movement, proportion, and overall essence. His philosophy, which emphasized working with one’s natural lines rather than against them, continues to resonate decades later.\n\nAt first, I thought I might be a Romantic, having read that they appeared soft and fleshy no matter how thin they were—a description that resonated with how I saw my own body. But I soon discovered that Romantics were strictly capped at 5’5”, and alas, I am 5’7”. For a while, I wavered between Soft Natural and Soft Dramatic, drawn to the celebrity examples of the former (Scarlett Johansson, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez), yet knowing my height made the latter more likely. An AI program told me I was likely a Soft Classic—curvy, yes, but only moderately so—but although the smooth, flowing lines recommended for that type aligned with my wardrobe, my height once again disqualified me.\n\nThis kind of endless self-examination is central to Kibbe, with online forums filled with women posting full-length photos—faces obscured—searching for confirmation of whether they have “Kibbe curve” or simply “conventional curve,” vertical or width, sharpness or softness.\n\nKibbe’s Metamorphosis categorizes thirteen body types along a Yin-Yang continuum, assigning each an “image identity” meant to guide personal style. Each type comes with a set of recommendations—silhouettes, fabrics, and styling choices designed to highlight an individual’s natural essence. In recent years, the system has seen a resurgence, fueled by social media communities on TikTok, Reddit, and YouTube—alongside other style frameworks like Kitchener essences and seasonal color analysis.\n\nPart of the system’s appeal, explains fashion designer and style blogger Gabrielle Arruda, who has written extensively about Kibbe, lies in the multiple ways you can engage with it. “There’s a ‘junk food’ side to it and a whole meal side to it,” she says. “You can analyze celebrity ‘types’ on TikTok or do an online quiz and get a quick answer. If you find your type, and it resonates, there’s a sense of gratification and connection in that.” But beyond the surface-level fun, she says, the system offers a deeper approach—one that helps people understand which lines and fabrics best suit their bodies and why.",

        "title": "Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal on Bringing a Powerhouse Othello to Broadway",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "We’re talking about faith. Last December, just before Christmas, actor Denzel Washington was baptized and licensed as a minister, and so it hasn’t taken long, chatting about his return to Broadway playing the title role in Othello, for conversation to turn to matters of belief. Not religious, per se; Shakespeare’s great tragedy turns on themes of love and jealousy and betrayal. Perhaps, I muse, Othello’s choice to trust the evidence of his eyes—a planted handkerchief—over his innocent wife Desdemona’s protests that she has never strayed, is a kind of loss of faith, a misguided embrace of rationality over spirit. “Well, sure, he wants proof,” pipes up Jake Gyllenhaal, who co-stars in the production as Iago, planter of the aforementioned handkerchief, “and, Iago keeps leading him back to the handkerchief—look, look!—but the only reason he can manipulate Othello that way is that they have a bond. They’ve fought together, trusted each other with their lives. He knows this is a man with a great sense of faith and love.”\n\n“Mm-hm,” adds Washington. Meanwhile, he’s picked up a thick binder and is flicking through it. We’re in a small midtown office a few minutes’ walk from the Barrymore Theatre, where the two actors will be performing in Othello through June 8—one of the starriest outings in what is shaping up to be a very starry Broadway season. In an hour or so, the pair is due at the theater for a meeting with the play’s director, Broadway veteran Kenny Leon, who staged a revival of Our Town at the Barrymore just last fall. Rain is pelting down outside as we chat, and Gyllenhaal seems to be keeping half an eye on it as he continues ruminating. “But Iago also knows, Desdemona—that’s something new for Othello. Which makes him vulnerable.”\n\n“He’s not experienced putting all his cards on the table for one woman,” Washington chimes in, still focused on his binder.\n\n“He’s been at war,” adds Gyllenhaal.\n\n“Seven years of war,” adds Washington, citing the play. “So that’s his biography, right there. That’s where he’s comfortable. Battle.”\n\nI feel like I’m in college. I say so. Gyllenhaal laughs. “This is what we do. It’s the best—going around and around, trying to figure out, who are these people? What makes them do what they do?”\n\n“Ah!” Washington holds up his binder. He’s found what he was looking for: a page from his notes on the script, with a line of Othello’s scrawled in all caps: if she be false, heaven mocks itself. He flashes his iconic megawatt smile. “Talking about faith—that’s actually the first thing I wrote down,” he says. Then, from under his ballcap, he fixes me with an ardent gaze and says the line aloud, falling into character. “If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself! I’ll not believe it!” I don’t feel like I’m in college anymore. A different, dreamier smile plays over Washington’s face as he quotes from elsewhere in the play. “For know Iago, but that I love the gentle Desdemona...”\n\nReturning to himself, Washington grins, forms a finger pistol and aims it at Gyllenhaal. “Learning my lines! Finally catching up with this guy!”\n\nIn a manner of speaking, Gyllenhaal started learning his Iago lines seven months before rehearsals for Othello began in New York. “I’d never done Shakespeare,” he explains. “And you get that call and it’s, not only do I want to do this, I have to do this. But honestly, I didn’t know: can I do it? It scared me.”\n\nThus Gyllenhaal embarked on a five-day-a-week, two or three-hour-a-day Shakespeare training regimen not entirely dissimilar, I suggest to him, from the process of getting into fighting form for, say, Road House. “Sort of...” he assents, somewhat skeptical of the analogy. “You’re learning a language. And that top layer of, ‘what does this mean?’ you can get through pretty fast, but then the words, they’re so intense, what he’s actually saying—you can get lost in them. And the only thing I’m concerned about,” Gyllenhaal continues, “is being present and able to listen to one of greatest actors ever when we’re onstage.”\n\n“And I’m seven months behind,” quips Washington, who—at time of writing, a week before opening night of previews—still wasn’t off-book.\n\n“But you’re used to this, the words don’t get in your way,” notes Gyllenhaal. He glances over at me, then turns back toward Washington, gazing at him with not a little wonder. “He can say his lines like, you know, like they’re just coming out of his mouth...” Great acting, Gyllenhaal will later remark, is often a matter of doing as near as possible to nothing.\n\n“Sometimes you’ll have this sort of explosion of inspiration from the word when you hear it,” says Gyllenhaal. “And sometimes you keep it as simple as you possibly can.”\n\n“Well,” Washington offers with a shrug. “sometimes the line is just Shakespeare’s version of ‘get out of here.’”\n\nCREATIVE COUNCIL\n\nGyllenhaal and Washington with Othello’s director, Broadway veteran Kenny Leon.\n\n\n\nFor Washington, Othello is a homecoming. And a reunion. Twenty years ago, he played Brutus in a lauded Broadway production of Julius Caesar; his itch to do more Shakespeare wasn’t satisfied by his turn playing the title role in Joel Coen’s 2021 film The Tragedy of Macbeth. In the interim, Washington had struck up a fruitful collaboration with director Leon, with whom he’d worked on the Broadway plays Fences and A Raisin in the Sun. It so happened that Leon was fresh off mounting a production of Hamlet for Shakespeare in the Park—only his second staging of the Bard, after winning the 2020 Obie for his direction of Much Ado About Nothing—when Washington got it into his head to take a fresh crack at Othello, a part he first played half a century ago, as a 20-year-old drama student.",

        "content": "Actor Lily-Rose Depp is certainly no stranger to Hollywood’s red carpet scene, but at last night’s 2025 Oscars, the star marked her very first time attending the ceremony. Last evening, Depp was on hand as a presenter, where she introduced the Best Costume Design award; It just so happens that her own film, Nosferatu, was nominated in the category, thanks to the intricate costuming work of Linda Muir. “I’m thrilled to be able to be there to support the incredible nominees from our film Nosferatu,” Depp tells Vogue. “[Costume design is] an aspect of filmmaking that I love so much. I am endlessly in awe of Linda Muir and her incomparable work. I also grew up watching the Oscars every year without fail, which is another reason why I was so excited to be attending. It feels surreal!”\n\nGiven it was such a milestone moment to be attending the Oscars as a first-timer, the star was sure to bring a glamorous look with her to the occasion. As a longtime face of Chanel, Depp looked to the French fashion house for her custom design. She wore a Chanel Couture black floral lace halter dress complete with a peplum, all embroidered with black sequins, crystals, and pearls. “My wonderful stylist Spencer Singer and I really wanted to go classic, pure old Hollywood glamour for this special night. Specifically channeling Marilyn Monroe, Veronica Lake, and all our favorite Hollywood starlets,” says Depp of the inspiration. “We wanted the dress to feel true to that inspiration, but also quintessentially Chanel haute couture.”",

Qualley, who starred in the best picture-nominated film The Substance, hit the red carpet in a black velvet cap-sleeve Chanel dress with a dramatic low back.

Amping up her already electric cobalt Balenciaga couture dress, she draped a Boucheron necklace down her back. Along with an eccentric ear cuff, she wore the brand’s white gold Quatre Radiant Edition High Jewelry tie necklace, which was paved with round, baguette, and princess-cut diamonds.\n\nMargaret Qualley at the 2025 Oscars.

What began with a food truck set up to feed the police, firefighters, and crew working the party has morphed into a longstanding tradition, with In-N-Out burgers becoming almost as coveted as an Oscar statuette itself.\n\nAt last night’s party, Vogue witnessed Mark Eydelshteyn—the breakout Russian actor from best picture winner Anora—try his very first In-N-Out. “It’s very tasty,” Eydelshteyn said while mid-bite. “And unexpected!” He wasn’t the only star to feast on the West Coast delicacy, either. Shortly after arriving at the bash, best actor winner Adrien Brody joined his mother, Sylvia Plachy, his father, Elliot, and his girlfriend, Marchesa designer Georgina Chapman, to indulge in a burger together. Even newly minted best supporting actress winner Zoë Saldaña could be spotted gliding through the party with her burger in one hand and her Oscar in the other. Last year, Steven Spielberg famously snapped a few personal pics of his prized burger before chowing down.",

My grandpa always asked me to sing it, and it has always been a part of my life, becoming even more meaningful to me over the years.”\n\nWhile Grande captivated the audience with her powerful vocals, she also brought forth Oscar-worthy fashions to match the excitement. Working with stylist Mimi Cuttrell, Grande wore two spellbinding Schiaparelli gowns designed by Daniel Roseberry. “I love Daniel and Schiaparelli more than life itself, so to have been able to share this moment with him and the incredible team for both of my looks, was such a surreal honor,” says Grande. Her carpet look, in the softest Glinda pink, consisted of a satin duchess bustier dress and nude silk-tulle skirt. The silhouette was inspired by an Alberto Giacometti lamp that Roseberry found in the Schiaparelli archives, and it featured over 190,000 crystal sequins, rhinestones, and beads.",

He wanted to be the next Calvin Johnson.\n\n“Arguably the greatest wide receiver of all time,” Shelton says, tucked into the back seat of an Escalade crawling through midtown Manhattan. “His nickname was Megatron—he played for the Detroit Lions: six foot five, 240, ran a 4.3 40-yard dash, kind of a freak athlete. And he showed up for my birthday one year—I must have been seven—when my dad was a coach at Georgia Tech and he was playing football there. He signed a ball for me. I was a fan for life.”\n\nTESTING THE WATER\n\n“I’m not a finished product,” says Shelton, who’s quickly gone from a ranking of 1,829th to 14th.\n\n\n\nSome 15 years later, Shelton—six foot four, 195, 150 mph serve, kind of a freak athlete himself—is in New York to play a much-hyped exhibition match against Carlos Alcaraz at Madison Square Garden. Since turning pro a mere two years ago—having started playing tennis seriously only at the age of 12 (making him very much an arriviste among the pro ranks, where many players started at the age of three or four)—Shelton has reached the semifinals of the US Open (in 2023) and the Australian Open (earlier this year); he’s beaten current world-number-one Jannik Sinner, along with a host of other top-10 and top-5 players; and he’s ascended those rankings himself—from the stratospheric 1,829th best in 2021 to 14th today.\n\nFormer pro Brad Gilbert—now an ESPN commentator and sometime coach (Coco Gauff and Andy Murray are just two of the players he’s worked with)—has been keeping an eye on Shelton. “Could he be top 10?” he asks. “Sure—I mean, he could be top five. I like his size, his movement; he’s got a wicked serve, obviously; and I like his potential—he’s also just really fun to watch. The big thing for him moving forward is improving his return game.”",

use this,\n\nand I use it on this really cool questionable device.\n\nI've been asked a lot of questions\n\nby anyone who notices this,\n\nand you can use it to wash your face.\n\nLet's just keep it at that.\n\nIt vibrates, which is really fun.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nI've been using it for quite some time.\n\nI find it to be really effective in cleaning my face,\n\nand it feels good.\n\nI usually use this, OCuSOFT Lid Scrub,\n\nbecause I have dry eyes.\n\nYes, I do.\n\nIt really just, it seems counterintuitive,\n\nbut I just clean my eyes,\n\nand I guess it helps me not to have dry eyes.\n\nThe next thing that I use is Real Ferment Micro Essence.\n\nI just feel like it kind of like re-wets my skin.\n\nThis is something\n\nthat my sister-in-law told me about.\n\nI saw this like in her van\n\nwhen we were on like a surf trip,\n\nand I was like, What the hell is that?\n\nIt's snail mucin.\n\nAdam gets into the mucin.\n\nWe share, we're like a mucin family.\n\nI feel very moisturized right now.\n\nAnd then can you believe\n\nI have another serum that I put on?\n\nMoisture Boost Plumping Serum.\n\nI did get on the SPF train pretty early,\n\nwhich I'm glad about.\n\nI use these two things usually together.\n\nOne is tinted and one isn't.\n\nI mix it together, and it's kind of lighter.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIf we're being honest,\n\nthat's like mostly what I just do most days.\n\nBut I'm just gonna bump it up a little bit\n\n'cause this is fun.\n\nThere's no reason why I'm doing this part.\n\nIt's fun, and they're sort of like getting prepped.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIt is Kosas.\n\nWhen I was like late teens, early 20s,\n\nI got really like into\n\nmy little sitting on the floor in front of the mirror\n\nkind of makeup routine.\n\nI basically would do like five auditions in a day,\n\nand so there was just like a moment of meditation.\n\nI had like hot rollers\n\nand like a full like face of makeup,\n\nwhich over, you know, the last 20 years\n\nI've really just been like,\n\nI actually like how my skin looks without foundation on.\n\nI'm gonna do a little eye makeup.\n\nI'll just use what's ostensibly the lightest color in here.\n\nAnd I do that.\n\nYou just slap it on there,\n\nand I kind of rub in this little zone.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nThe glam stuff is like a really fun element\n\nwhen you get ready to go to an event.\n\nIt's like this really glamorous\n\naspect to the business that I enjoy.\n\nSpeaking of glam,\n\nthis one right here, this dark guy.\n\nI just kind of go a little bit closer,\n\nblend it a little bit, just a little bit.\n\nWow.\n\nTake a look at this cool eyeliner.\n\nIt all squished out.\n\nNot to fear, you use a little brush like this.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIt's definitely like me time\n\ngetting your little skincare\n\nand even just, whatever, minimal makeup in.\n\nI just think this is so pretty,\n\nand I kind of just wanna like try it.\n\nI'm gonna make my eyes a little bit shinier.\n\nI like this kind of thing.\n\nThis is, I think, for bronzing...\n\nContouring.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nAnd I kind of put it here 'cause I see people do that.\n\n[Leighton laughs]\n\nWell, I should probably do this part.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nI like to try to just be nice to myself.\n\nIt's so basic, but it's very helpful for me\n\nnot to say negative words about myself.\n\nIt would be like in meetings or on set,\n\nI'd be like, This is a dumb idea, but whatever.\n\nOr, I'm sorry to ramble on, I'm sorry to rant.\n\nIt's more helpful generally for me\n\nto just say nice words to myself about myself.\n\nI just sort of instinctively\n\nstart absorbing that and believing it.\n\nOkay, mascara.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nMy kids, they get what we do.\n\nThey come on location a lot.\n\nI don't think that they're phased at all\n\nbecause they get a lot of us off set\n\nand a lot of us like not working,\n\nwhich has been always like a really big benefit\n\nfor both of us.\n\nNow, actually, I'm gonna use this like shiny thing.\n\nI have seen this little thing happen before,\n\nand I don't mind.\n\nI'm gonna do it.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna do this,\n\nwhich is like for your lips and cheeks.\n\nThis thing is real left field.\n\nYou won't believe that I'm using this, an essential balm.\n\nAnd it looks like this,\n\nand I feel like it kind of looks cool up here.\n\nIt just looks a little bit like, you know, dewy and wet.\n\nAnd then I guess this would be the right time\n\nto do this part.\n\nI have more blush, and it's this crazy,\n\nI mean, it's so bright,\n\nbut it's kind of subtle.\n\nI know that I try really hard to be all shiny,\n\nbut now I'm doing this matte powder thing.\n\nLip liners, to me,\n\nthey're just too concrete so much of the time\n\nwhere I'm like, I'm locked in,\n\nand this is what I'm gonna have to do and stick with.\n\nBut if I think if you just kind of like\n\njust do it a little bit and then kind of like smudge it.\n\nGroundbreaking, I know.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nSo I'll do this, this little guy.\n\nThis is new to me.\n\nI've had makeup artists do this.\n\nThis smells really good.\n\nThis was so very fun.\n\nThank you for watching.\n\nBye!

Here, we’ve chatted with sleep experts and nutritionists to suss out the best sleep supplements—whether you’re trying to regulate your sleep during an international flight or quiet your mind long enough to drift off to dreamland.\n\nLife Extension Serene Sleep\n\nLife Extension Serene Sleep Dietary Supplement $14 AMAZON\n\nWhy We Love It: While melatonin may be the most well-known natural sleep aid, depending on the reason for your sleep issues, it may not be the right choice.

        "content": "There are obvious centers of power: business headquarters, movie studios, government buildings. Then there are the places where power is wielded quietly—the rooms where ideas are born over martinis, business deals brought up over barolos, where “networking” is verboten but deeper conversations about are very much in vogue. And in Los Angeles, that place is Tower Bar.\n\nThe restaurant inside the near-century-old Sunset Tower has long been the preferred evening playground of Hollywood’s power players—not just for A-list celebrities (although there are plenty of those, with regulars including Mick Jagger and Jennifer Aniston), but the studio heads, super-agents, and other invisible hands that guide the multi-billion-dollar entertainment industry. In a 1947 letter, Truman Capote described the Sunset Tower as “a very posh establishment” where “every scandal that ever happened happened.” Not much has changed.\n\nA window table at Tower Bar. Photo: Courtesy of Sunset Tower Hotel\n\nAt the heart of it all is Dimitri Dimitrov, the 75-year-old maitre d’. He oversees the room’s intricate choreography every evening—the reservations, the seating chart, the VIPs, the walk-ins, the drama—in an Armani blazer and Timex watch given to him by Bill Murray. Known for his attention to detail and his charming Moldovan accent, Dimitrov is so beloved by the powers-that-be in Hollywood that he’s become one of them: in 2022, he played a maitre d’ in Don’t Worry Darling, and in September 2024, The Hollywood Reporter announced a documentary about him was in the works. “In a town where gossip is the coin of the realm, Mr. Dmitrov is a sphinxlike figure who knows everything and says nothing,” read a profile of Dimitrov in The New York Times. “And, like Erich von Stroheim in Sunset Boulevard, his loyalty to his fragile industry charges is fierce and absolute.”\n\nSo, this Oscars weekend, Vogue asked Dimitriv to give us a day in his life. It starts with coffee—and dozens of calls asking for reservations—and ends with a seating chart. Below, read everything that happens in between.\n\n11 a.m.: Getting Out of Bed\n\nI get six and a half hours of sleep. On a weekend, maybe half an hour more. But if I only have four hours sleep, three, four hours, then I feel it. I’m not good. I’m irritated, so I'm not as good. It's a very slow waking up.\n\nMidday: Coffee and Reservation Requests\n\nBy 12, I’m having my coffee. There’s already dozens of incoming calls to try to make reservations. I see what we can do on the floor plan with timing and the quantity and the table, who we can accommodate in.\n\nI’ll be making probably six to 12 calls to various important clients. And I’ll tell them that reservation is confirmed. If there are little changes—they would like a reservation at 7:30, say—I’ll tell them, ‘Can you please come half an hour earlier, and then we’re looking forward to serving you.’ In a very humble way.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "One wouldn’t expect to find a Best Actor nominee walking down Sunset Boulevard the morning of the 2025 Oscars. Nevertheless, Colman Domingo started his day with a quick workout and a haircut from Chaz Hazlitt before pulling on sweatpants and heading out the door of The Pendry Hotel in West Hollywood.\n\n“What better place than to go for a nice walk? There’s been many dreams that have been achieved—and many that have failed—on Sunset Boulevard. So I thought I’d just walk where dreamers walk and take it all in,” Domingo tells Vogue over the phone. “I like to take a moment for gratitude, my past, all that was built to be here, and then look towards the future. To me, that always involves walking.”\n\nColman Domingo at the 2025 Oscars. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nDomingo celebrated his second consecutive Academy Award nomination with his role in Sing Sing. (Last year, he was nominated in the same category for Rustin.) To mark the momentous occasion, he turned to Alessandro Michele, who fashioned him a custom Valentino suit. Domingo has become something of a Valentino man lately, wearing Alessandro Michele’s designs several times throughout awards season. While the 2024 Academy Gala, 2025 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and DGA Awards saw more outré looks, Michele also put his stamp on classic red carpet dressing for the 2025 Golden Globes and SAG Awards.\n\n2025 Palm Springs International Film Festival Photo: Getty Images 2024 Academy Gala Photo: Getty Images 2025 DGA Awards Amy Sussman/Getty Images\n\nThe process of creating Domingo’s Oscars look began with Michele’s sketches, which the actor describes as “high energy, impactful fashion moments.” Collaboration ensues. “[Valentino] shows me what they’re interested in, and then myself and my stylists, Wayman + Micah, we get involved,” Domingo says. “We do some editing and we really started to do some storytelling.” For the 97th Academy Awards, Domingo felt especially moved to wear the color red.\n\n“It felt like everything’s coming up roses. It felt like love. The thing that I feel like I’m speaking about more than anything—more than process, more than moments of achievements—I’m talking about [how] to be resilient and to bring love energy into a room,” he says. “What better color than that classic Valentino red? So they came back with some more sketches and Alessandro leaned into that.”\n\n2025 SAG Awards Photo: Getty Images 2025 Golden Globes Photo: Getty Images\n\nValentino took the brief to heart, creating a tailored, double-breasted jacket in red shantung silk over a matching shirt with a guru collar and black frog neck closure. He finished the look with black wool trousers and a tasseled belt. Domingo’s accessories were just as high-octane: he added vintage Boucheron jewelry and a custom diamond-encrusted Omega watch. “Everyone has really come around to really help me tell a good story. I’m feeling like my best self,” he says.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "When David Lynch died in January, Isabella Rossellini paid tribute to him on Instagram, writing, “I loved him so much.” Today, at the 2025 Oscars, she used fashion to celebrate the director.\n\nWhile she’s nominated for best supporting actress for her role as Sister Agnes in Conclave, Rossellini is looking back to the start of her career: her breakthrough role in Lynch’s 1986 film, Blue Velvet. (While Rossellini also starred in Lynch’s 1990 film, Wild at Heart, their relationship reached beyond the professional: They dated for five years, between 1987 and 1991.) So it was only fitting that Dolce & Gabbana help Rossellini honor the director in a blue velvet dress.\n\n“I made a film in 1986 with David Lynch called Blue Velvet and I wore a blue velvet robe; it was a Bobby Lenton song,” Rossellini tells Vogue. “We had the idea with Stefano Gabbana and [Domenico] Dolce for the dress. Their clothes always tells stories–their references to the Catholic church, Italian Cinema. Even sometimes vegetable like basil–like Italian cuisine. They like to tell stories. When we discussed the outfit for the Oscars, David had just passed away, we decided we were going to honor him with the dress. A Blue Velvet dress!”\n\nFrazer Harrison Frazer Harrison\n\nThe tribute wasn’t limited to fashion—Rossellini walked the carpet with Laura Dern, a fellow Lynch muse and her co-star in Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart. Dern, who is filming a movie in New York, flew in the night before the Oscars and left on the red-eye flight following the ceremony in order to make her 7 a.m. call time Monday morning. “Laura and I became very good friends during Blue Velvet and we were both very close to David. So I ask Laura to be my plus-one and she was delighted,” Rossellini says. “I am very grateful to her.” Dern adds, “It was an honor to be the date of a legend, my gorgeous brilliant friend, Isabella to the Academy Awards on behalf of her nomination. I know we both feel privileged to sit side by side in tribute to our beloved David Lynch and all he has given art, cinema, and humanity.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "As Fashion Month got underway, Olivier Saillard sat at his double-wide desk upstairs at the Azzedine Alaïa Foundation surveying mountains of files containing magazine clippings, runway photos, and show notes unearthed alongside the more than 300 pieces by Thierry Mugler in the late couturier’s fabled hoard.\n\nAmong them was a program—in triplicate—for Thierry Mugler’s “Futures Spirales” Winter 1979-1980 fashion show. On page three appears the first public acknowledgement of Alaïa’s contribution to a collection. Famously, in the mid-1960s, it was Alaïa who assembled the prototype of the Mondrian dress for Yves Saint Laurent, just one of his many moonlighting gigs in the studios of famous designers of the day. For Mugler, Alaïa had worked on sculptural smokings. “Without him, they would never have been so beautiful,” Mugler wrote. The only hitch: the credit read “Asdin Allaia.”\n\nCurator Olivier Saillard. Photographed by François Goizé\n\n“I need to find a way to include that,” Saillard mused. And so it was that the program made its way into a frame onto the wall for the opening of “Azzedine Alaïa-Thierry Mugler 1980-1990: Two Decades of Artistic Affinities,” which opened tonight at the Fondation Azzedine Alaïa in the Marais.\n\n“More than 40 years later, I’m still embarrassed,” admitted the retired fashion consultant Jean-Jacques Picart, Mugler’s PR at the time, who traveled to Paris from his home in the South of France for the preview.\n\nMore importantly, that relic speaks to a friendship that spanned decades, although it was spliced by a protracted feud. The affront dates to the first and only French fashion Oscars, in 1985, when the Fédération Française de la Couture (as it was then known) awarded Alaïa two trophies, the special jury prize and the designer of the year prize. In his acceptance speech, Alaïa, never one for public appearances, forgot to thank Mugler, without whose encouragement he might never have broken out. Aggrieved, Mugler left in a huff with his entourage of muses. For the next three decades, the two no longer spoke.",

Still, we couldn’t miss her—thanks largely in part to the fact that she’s wearing her own eponymous label. Beckham donned a charcoal trench coat from her fall 2024 collection, which she wore collar up, shielding the lower half of her face from the cold (and the paparazzi).\n\nVictoria Beckham in Paris, March 2025. Marc Piasecki\n\nThe rest of her outfit was patented Beckham style, too. She contrasted her dark coat with a pair of white wide-legged trousers, tailored to perfection so they hovered just above the ground (skimming her go-to platforms, naturally). She also embraced the color du jour with a double handle oxblood tote bag slung over her shoulder. The sole deviation from her brand were her Bottega Veneta shield sunglasses.\n\nVictoria Beckham in Paris, November 2024.

During his opening monologue, Oscars host Conan O’Brien set up a bit that involved the legendary comic attending the year’s fanciest and most decadent Hollywood event in classic schmuck style—specifically, basketball shorts, sneakers, and a bright blue sweatshirt that I have to assume he borrowed from one of his daughters.\n\nAfter O’Brien accuses Sandler of being dressed like “a guy playing video poker at 2 a.m.” (fair and also…kind of hot? I may have problems), Sandler responds: “Did my snazzy gym shorts and fluffy sweatshirt offend you so much that you had to mock me in front my peers?”\n\nIt wasn’t Sandler’s first time popping up during an awards show this year either. He was also roped into Nikki Glaser’s monologue at the Golden Globes in January, when she joked that Chalamet’s name “sounds like something Adam Sandler would say” before getting Sandler himself involved. (A nominee that night, he was dressed, for the record, in a perfectly respectable dark jacket.)",

The 97th Academy Awards were nothing short of buzzy since Conan O’Brien was announced as the evening’s host.

Catch up on all the 2025 Oscar winners here.\n\nGoing into the night, we didn’t know who would walk away with the golden statuettes, be we knew to expect a night of high glamour from nominees.

The men have also represented on the fashion front, with the ever-stylish Colman Domingo and the singular Jeremy Strong among the nominees.\n\nThe Academy Awards is known to be a relatively safe red carpet.

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "To the men I might want to date some day: stop reading now. I’m a Gemini sun, Scorpio moon, Virgo rising. In layman’s terms, this means I’m generally outgoing, sociable and organised but with a propensity to ruminate. It also means that, like everyone else with a birthday, I’m more compatible with some star signs than others. Leos are great, alongside Aquarians and Libras, mostly because they can match and complement my energy. Virgos can work, too, as can Sagittarians.\n\nFeline friends aside, Scorpios are an absolute no, which I learnt the hard way after dating one for four years. It was only after we broke up that I realised how incompatible we were, astrologically and otherwise. Imagine all the time and anguish I could’ve saved myself had I recognised that sooner. Facetiousness aside, I do believe everything I’ve read about astrological compatibility has rung true in my love life. The Capricorn I dated last year really was a little too quiet for me, and the Cancer I met on Hinge described me as “completely bonkers” on our second date. There was not a third date.\n\nMy friends abide by this, too; the second one of us starts dating someone new, we always ask about their star sign. One was so badly burned by a Sagittarius that when I told her I’d started dating one a few years ago, she rattled through the list of things I’d find difficult about him. “He’ll always be looking for the next thing and won’t ever want to sit still because it will make him feel trapped and he always needs to feel free,” she told me. “He’ll barely commit to a date let alone a relationship. Run a mile.” I scoffed at first, but a few weeks later, she was proven right – we also believe she might be psychic, but that’s another article entirely.\n\nI don’t believe in being so prescriptive that I would never go out with someone purely because of their star sign. And I’m aware that a lot of stereotypes around certain astrological signs are ludicrous—see the @notallgeminis Instagram account—but I do think it’s an important thing to ask early on when, let’s face it, all of us are putting our best foot forward in a bid to impress the other person. Knowing their star sign might give you a better idea of who someone really is and how aligned they might be with you. It can also alert you to any potential hurdles, subsequently making you better equipped to handle them when they come up. Cancers, for example, have a tendency to be hyper sensitive. Being aware of this from the outset could help elicit a little more empathy when it becomes apparent.",

        "content": "Colman Domingo in Valentino. Frazer Harrison\n\nAre men having the most fun with fashion these days? It should not go without saying that much of this has to do with the fact that men have it easy when it comes to earning a spot on best dressed lists. For one, all it takes is an interesting—meaning out-of-the-ordinary—look to stand out. Break the mold of the black tux and you’ll make a headline. There’s also the fact that there are little to no expectations for men on the red carpet; other than making sure things fit and are tailored correctly, it’s hard to make too big of a faux pas. While Apollo, Domingo, and Chalamet certainly went the extra mile with their terrific looks, it helps that we are culturally primed to just appreciate a well-groomed man.\n\nWomen, however, don’t have it that easy: They should show they’re “serious actors” while looking like they “care.” There’s corsets and stilettos and bustiers and outlandish couture shapes or deceivingly simple column gowns. There’s Old Hollywood glamour and avant-garde style, and they should somehow all be fashion darlings and “keep it interesting” while still looking Oscar-worthy, whatever that means these days. And even then, after checking every box, they may still not get on that best dressed list. Why are men having the most fun with fashion? Because they can, and because we let them.\n\nScroll through to see the best dressed men at the 2025 Oscars.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nWhat's up, Vogue?\n\nI'm Doja Cat and we are performing at the Oscars today.\n\nAnd so I'm getting ready\n\nand I want you to watch and I'm nervous.\n\nA healthy amount of nervous.\n\nLet's go, come on.\n\nIt is 12:15 in the afternoon.\n\nShe needs to be ready by 3:00 PM for the carpet.\n\nThe dress is not here yet,\n\nbut I have all faith within Hollywood traffic\n\nand Oscars madness that it will be here.\n\nWe did our final fitting last night.\n\nIt is an insane piece of couture that Balmain did.\n\nShe looks like Betty Boop.\n\nIt's really crazy.\n\nWith Amala, who's like my sister,\n\nbut then being Doja Cat\n\nand showing up in leopard print,\n\nI don't know if anyone else\n\ncan really pull that off beyond her.\n\nSo I'm performing Diamonds Are Forever by Sherry Bassey.\n\nI wanted to respect the original sound\n\nbeing it's from like the 70s\n\nand so I wanted to channel her\n\nbut also give just like a essence of myself within it.\n\nI love doing things that are not usual to me.\n\nI'm learning how to talk as a singer.\n\nAnd so I'm trying to split the difference between\n\nbeing raspy and myself\n\nand also being like this,\n\njust giving them a little bit of warmth and tone.\n\nIt's protective towards the voice,\n\nbut without also, see, there's two different...\n\nIt's like I'm trying to find the middle ground of that.\n\nAnd I feel like that voice comes with a character.\n\nMy vocal coach did suggest that I speak in a dopey tone,\n\nso I didn't wanna scare you when he walked in\n\nand start talking like this.\n\nSo the dresses for today have arrived.\n\nBalmain has done two amazing custom looks for us.\n\nThe leopard print is where we're going for carpet.\n\nIt's an insane moment.\n\nThis is all hand beaded from top to bottom.\n\nI know there was like 50 different artisans on it\n\nthat were stitching by hand all of these insane beads\n\nand our lovely tailor here in LA has been up all evening\n\nbeating the scarf for us to go around her neck.\n\nThey had this dress that was built I think in 1957\n\nthat this was inspired by, but Olivier did his spin on it\n\nand it has like the sweetheart neckline.\n\nIt's definitely corseted to the gods.\n\nBut yeah, it's just super special.\n\nAmala is moving into this new album cycle that there's a bit\n\nof an 80s essence.\n\nAnd so this is kind of bringing it to life,\n\nespecially with the glam.\n\nSo we were inspired by Mugatu, I'm just kidding.\n\nI love my natural hair and I love playing with it.\n\nI love like the shapes that it can take on.\n\nAnd so I really loved the idea of sweeping it upward.\n\nIt's kind of something that's been calling me\n\nfor the last couple of months.\n\nI'm just loving this kind of square top head shape.\n\nAnd so I wanted to bring it to this\n\n'cause I think the dress is so incredibly strong\n\nand to kind of keep the upper head area more top\n\nand more separate from the dress as opposed\n\nto long trusses hanging over the dress.\n\nI think it lets the dress stand out.\n\nI think right off the bat, you can kind of compare it a bit\n\nto Grace Jones and the silhouette of it.\n\nI love that head shape, I love angular hair too.\n\nI think like it was something maybe more prominent\n\nin the 80s and I want to kind of play with that.\n\nI think that can be really fun\n\n'cause I can take my hair when it's not like this,\n\nbut like in the morning,\n\nI can just go like that and it stays like that.\n\nI go like this, it stays like that.\n\nIf I sweep it back, it's like very malleable\n\nand why not take advantage?\n\nSo I have conversations with him for the most part\n\nbecause hair is like hair.\n\nIt's a very defining characteristic of the body.\n\nMakeup is depending on where you are creatively.\n\nI think for this, me and Ivan\n\njust wanted to be very like, elegant, sexy,\n\nand not anything too experimental.\n\nI think a lot of the energy is coming from the dress\n\nand the silhouette.\n\nWith the gold dress,\n\nOlivier did a blue version of it\n\nthat was a long sleeved a couple collections ago,\n\nand I fell in love with it when I saw it then.\n\nBut when this opportunity came up for Oscars,\n\nit's a really special moment for her.\n\nThis being her first time going to Oscars,\n\nlooking like a female version\n\nof the Oscar made me quite excited.\n\nSo this is what she's wearing after the show.\n\nIt's, again, an insane amount of bead work\n\nthat there was multiple people in the 40s\n\nis what I remember hand beading this.\n\nAnd then at the bottom,\n\nthere's a fringe, there's a fabric fringe,\n\nand then there's a beaded fringe.\n\nSo when she moves,\n\nthere's a lot of beautiful movement to it.\n\nWe have some very amazing pieces from Messika\n\nand this necklace has not been worn yet\n\nand it's super special.\n\nIt's like, I don't wanna say how many carats it is,\n\nbut it's a canary diamond and it's insane.\n\nIt's always experimenting in the end\n\nbecause we don't get jewelry kind of till the last second,\n\njust for insurance reasons.\n\nBut I want to try it with the dress.\n\nBut they did this really beautiful scarf\n\nthat just adds to that like classic elegance on the carpet\n\nthat feels like it's an accessory enough.\n\nBut yeah, we'll see.\n\nWhen we get to the dressing, we'll find out.\n\nAll right, Vogue, I'm done with makeup and hair\n\nand we are gonna move on to getting dressed.\n\nIt's really, really, really special.\n\nYou look incredibly stunning, I want to cry.\n\nI know that this is honoring Barbara Broccoli tonight.\n\nSo I mean, it's an honor for me really\n\nthat I get to do this.\n\nIt really is a classic\n\nand a perfect series of films\n\nthat I really am very grateful.\n\nShe's gonna be a Bond girl.\n\nI hope she enjoys it.\n\nOkay, he wants me to be a Bond girl.\n\nI'm down, but I don't know what that entails.\n\nBut yes, I hope they enjoy it.\n\nI hope everybody at the Bond Industries enjoys that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThat's a wrap and I am going\n\nto go perform now for the Oscars.\n\nWish me luck and thanks again, Vogue, for everything.\n\n[bright music]",

While the lead-up to tonight's Oscars has seen plenty of glamorous red carpets—including at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and SAG Awards—the Academy Awards always serve as the grand finale. A-listers save their best suits and gowns for last, ensuring that the Oscars step and repeat is one to remember. The best dressed stars tonight? The presenters and nominees who met the moment by fusing traditional evening attire with a sense of fun and unexpected risk-taking—an opportune reminder that fashion is here to delight, entertain, and even polarize us.\n\nMany stars opted for loads of shimmer and crystals. Take Selena Gomez and her bejeweled Ralph Lauren column dress, or Demi Moore in a plunging Armani Privé gown. Strong shapes had a trending moment as well, as seen on Raffey Cassidy in her big-bowed silk Loewe dress. Statement hues also took over the red carpet. See: Michelle Yeoh in a cobalt blue Balenciaga strapless number, Coco Gauff in a cascading yellow Miu Miu dress, and Raye in a draped Vivienne Westwood corseted gown. It made for a colorful carpet that felt upbeat and celebratory.\n\nAs for some of the best dressed men of the night, A Complete Unknown star Timothée Chalamet stood out from the pack in his butter yellow leather Givenchy suit, while Sing Sing star Colman Domingo opted for red in a Valentino shawl suit. It was refreshing to see men rebuke tradition and experiment with flair; more of that, please.\n\nBelow, explore Vogue’s best dressed stars from the 2025 Oscars.",

        "content": "Photo: Courtesy of E! Entertainment\n\nFew A-listers haven’t stopped for Walliser’s Glambot. Almost a decade in, Walliser has become a pro at capturing celebs, though he admits working the Oscars is always an extra challenge. “People don’t really realize how chaotic it is,” says Walliser. “People are screaming, there’s security everywhere. It’s a chaotic, frenetic environment.” Luckily, he has a whole crew behind him to make the Glambot magic happen. (And happen quickly; clips are posted and uploaded to E! in real time.) “There’s an editing suite, lighting crew. people are running hard drives; there’s a whole team to make it all happen,” he says.\n\nTikTok: Courtesy of E! Entertainment TikTok: Courtesy of E! Entertainment\n\nThis awards season, some of Walliser's favorite Glambot moments included videos with Wicked stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, both of whom always nail the theatricality that a Glambot requires. “I always love a spin,” he says. “[An outfit] that moves and flows is always good. More movement is always better, but it can be challenging to find the camera when you’re spinning, because everything is moving so fast,” says Walliser. Another key trick, he says, is for stars to feel comfortable and at ease while filming it. “If you are feeling good, you will end up looking good on camera,” he says. “Half of my job is to make them feel relaxed and comfortable.”\n\nWalliser himself, meanwhile, has become a celebrity in his own right. While his main duty on Oscars night is to make the nominees look and feel their best, the director is always sure to look polished and red carpet-ready, too. He has even started working with stylists. “I’m developing how I want to represent myself, and what my style is,” says Walliser. “For the Oscars, I like to have fun with my outfits—either bright colors or interesting cuts. I’m okay with pushing the boundaries.” Another signature element of his look, is his epic curls. “Lately I’ve been experimenting with how I’m drying [my hair], and how I’m setting the curls,” he says. (Whatever he’s doing, it’s working.)",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "In 2018, Klausner heard from a friend that Van Noten was looking for a womenswear designer. “It was always very mysterious as a house. Even though I’m from Belgium, I never knew anybody who worked here. I always heard that people worked there for many years,” he explains. (The knitwear designer, for instance, has been working there for 28 years.) Klausner was intrigued by the opportunity and charmed when he met the founder and his partner Patrick Vangheluwe. “I understood it was a very small team and I would work very closely with Dries and I liked it. I liked the office and I liked the atmosphere. I said, ‘OK, let’s do it.’”\n\nSeven years after he joined, Van Noten decided it was time to retire. “When I was told Dries was stepping down, in the same conversation, I was asked if I would consider applying for the role. I barely had to think about it for a few seconds before saying yes,” he recalls. Then, Klausner went through a “proper process”. “ It was also important for me because I wanted to feel like if I get this position, I want to feel legitimate. It was so familiar for me working for Dries, making the connections for him, with him, that I had to get out of his point of view and get into my point of view and really think about my personal vision for the brand. I’m really excited to see some of the things that I was thinking of come to life.”\n\nIt was also about moving from being a colleague to being the one who leads the way. “I was open to any kind of reaction [from the team]. I’m very grateful for their support. They have taken me on board in a great way. When Dries stepped down, there were of course interrogations, doubts about what could happen. I don’t wanna speak for them, but I think it feels quite reassuring that it’s me from inside and it stays in the family.”\n\nSince being promoted, Klausner says he looks “at the bigger picture”. He assumes responsibility for womenswear and, for the first time, he’ll design menswear, too. Dries Van Noten has an advisory role on beauty and the design of the retail stores, with Klausner slowly getting involved in those aspects. Now that Klausner oversees the brand image, he’s eager to evolve digital communications.",

        "content": "Pay Dirt is Slate’s money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Kristin and Ilyce here. (It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nMy twin sister and I shared the burden of raising our three younger siblings because our mom was a flake and our dad was never at home. We didn’t have friends, date, or did after-school activities. We saved up and my sister made her own dress so we could go to prom but our idiot younger brother decided to try to jump from the house to the garage roof and broke his arm. We spent the night in the emergency room instead. Both my sister and I carry a lot of resentment about our childhoods because our siblings really don’t understand our sacrifices.\n\nThey still think it is their right to force us to give up our lives for them. They always argue that they are adults and we aren’t their parents so we can’t tell them what to do. But when they screw up, we are the first ones they call. My sister and I don’t want kids after our lack of childhood. I got the snip when I turned 19 and my sister is battling to get sterilized. Even in a blue state, her bodily autonomy is held hostage to what her future husband “might” want. This has been a huge point of contention since our youngest brother and sister have drunk the MAGA Kool-Aid. My sister has refused to talk to them since the election.\n\nNow my baby sister, unemployed and unmarried, has declared she is pregnant and expects me to fill the “fun uncle” role—basically, she wants me to play parent. She is giving me this “glorious gift” since I “mutilated” myself and will never know the joy of a child of my own blood. I told her nice try but she was better off applying for welfare and tracking down the baby daddy for child support. We ended up having a screaming fight where she accused me of abandoning her since she didn’t have anyone else. Our father’s new wife hates us, mom is wherever, our brothers have their own lives, and my sister would flatly tell her get an abortion or give the baby up for adoption. My sister isn’t taking my calls and I am torn between guilt and resentment. This is the same pattern—yet, I don’t want my future niece/nephew to suffer like we did as kids. But I refuse to be forced to play parent again. I can pay my bills and work on my creative career because I have no dependents. It is very hard to not view my younger sister as the 2.0 version of our mother. Help!\n\n—No Fun Here\n\nDear No Fun Here,\n\nMy heart is breaking for you and your whole family. Your parents sound awful, and your siblings (save your one sister) sound entitled and generally uninformed. You stepped up in a time when they couldn’t fend for themselves. Now, they can. They just don’t want to. Well, welcome to adulthood.\n\nYour advice to apply for welfare and chase down the wayward dad is solid. Your sister needs to grow up and understand you’re not her parent, or anyone else’s, and she needs to hear you reiterate you’ve had enough “blood” parenting (a novel and rather revolting term, really) for your entire lifetime. I can tell you’re a kind-hearted soul, but as long as you keep rescuing your siblings they’ll keep asking you to do that, and more. If you’re worried about the next generation, you can always set aside a little money in a 529 college savings plan that you control, and name your future niece or nephew as the beneficiary.\n\nIt won’t be easy to let go of the feeling that if you don’t save everyone, they’ll flounder, or worse. You might be right, and they will. But ultimately, they could have made the same choices you did. Since they didn’t, you have to let go and enjoy your life. You’ve earned it.\n\n—Ilyce\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nOver seven years ago, my brother abruptly stopped speaking to me. I have not seen him since. We had always gotten along fine, and there was no argument or inciting incident that prompted the estrangement that I know of. I’ve sent messages asking what went wrong and proposing that we meet to discuss it, but he never responded.",

        "title": "The Stakes in These Two States’ Judicial Elections Could Not Be Higher",
        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "This piece was originally published on State Court Report , a hub for reporting, analysis, and commentary about state courts and constitutions. State Court Report is a project of the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nOnly two states are holding races this year for spots on their high courts, but the elections involve some of the highest stakes and most expensive judicial contests ever. In fact, with about a month left before an April 1 election for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the race has seen more than $33 million in spending, including $6 million from groups affiliated with Elon Musk, the world’s richest man.\n\nAt a time when state supreme courts and their elections are getting more attention than ever, ideological court majorities are up for grabs in both Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. (Louisiana could have held an election this year as well, but the election was canceled after only one candidate filed to run for the seat.) Just two years ago, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania set records with the two most expensive judicial elections ever.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the 2023 election flipped the ideological majority on the court in favor of progressives for the first time in over a decade. Now, with the retirement of a member of the progressive wing of the court, that majority could flip back if conservatives’ preferred candidate, former Republican Attorney General and current trial court Judge Brad Schimel, wins the seat. Schimel is running for the open seat against trial court Judge Susan Crawford, who has been endorsed by the state Democratic Party, in the nonpartisan election.*\n\nThe impact of the court’s new progressive majority has been perhaps clearest in its election-related docket. In one 2024 decision, the court divided 4–3 along ideological lines to allow election administrators to use drop boxes to collect absentee ballots. That opinion overturned a high-profile decision the court’s conservative majority had issued just two years earlier. In another major decision, the same 4–3 majority ordered the redrawing of state legislative districts, which were based on maps drawn by the state’s Republican-majority Legislature, after the prior court majority had declined to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe election could also have an almost immediate impact on abortion rights in the state. Late last year, the current court heard oral arguments in Kaul v. Urmanski, which will decide whether a 176-year-old law bans abortion in the state. If the court rules that the law does limit abortion access, a case brought by Planned Parenthood asks the court to hold that the Wisconsin Constitution protects the right to an abortion. While the court heard Kaul with its current members and will likely issue a decision before a new justice is seated, the new justice would almost certainly be on the bench in time to participate in Planned Parenthood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate That Oval Office Shouting Match Was a Setup Read More\n\nThe fight for abortion rights has heightened the stakes of the elections for states’ highest courts across the country. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago, shifting many legal fights about abortion access to state courts, state judicial races have shattered spending records, made national headlines, and seen campaign messaging more closely resembling a race for a key U.S. Senate seat than the more mundane state judicial elections of even a few years ago.\n\nAs a result, Wisconsin political commentators predict this race will again be the most expensive judicial election ever, surpassing the 2023 election’s approximately $56 million in spending by candidates, political parties, and interest groups. The $33 million these spenders have already poured into this year’s race includes more than $13 million from national interest groups, according to filings with the state ethics commission and data on TV spending collected through the Brennan Center’s Buying Time project. So far, much more of the money—$20 million—is benefiting Schimel than Crawford.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the 5–2 Democratic majority is similarly at stake in this year’s elections, though on a slightly longer timeline. In November, three sitting justices, Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty, and David Wecht, all Democrats, will stand in retention elections. Justices do not face opponents in such elections; rather, voters cast a yes-no ballot about whether to give a justice another 10-year term on the court. If voters decline to do so, that empty seat would be filled temporarily by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, subject to confirmation by the state Senate, and then filled for a full term via a partisan election to be held in 2027. Should all three justices facing retention election this year lose the vote, the majority would be up for grabs in the 2027 election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the Pennsylvania court’s highest-profile decisions last year depended on the votes of justices standing for retention this year. That includes a decision in the final days of the 2024 election allowing voters to cast a provisional ballot if the mail ballots they submitted were disqualified for technical reasons.\n\nLike in Wisconsin, new justices in Pennsylvania, whether appointed or elected, may be poised to decide whether the state Constitution protects the right to an abortion. A decision early last year reinstated a lawsuit challenging a ban on Medicaid funding for abortion, allowing the case to continue in the lower courts. A majority of justices declined at that time to reach the question of whether the Constitution protects abortion access, but as one justice wrote, “this case does not concern the right to an abortion. At least, not yet.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Donohue, Dougherty, and Wecht won their current terms via competitive elections in 2015, their races combined saw $29 million in spending (adjusted for inflation), which was record setting at the time. The 2023 Pennsylvania election saw nearly that much spending for a single seat.\n\nIf majorities on either court were to change as a result of the elections, recent experiences in other states suggest those changes could quickly result in dramatic shifts in the jurisprudence coming out of these courts. When Republicans claimed a majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court in 2022, the new majority quickly deployed rarely used procedural mechanisms to reverse recent decisions of the previous majority. In Iowa, the state Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that the state Constitution protected the right to an abortion, only to overturn that right in 2022 with a new majority of justices in place. And in Wisconsin itself, a justice dissenting from the order striking down the state legislative maps accused the new majority of obscuring the fact that it was just overturning a recently decided case and asked whether the decision was “the first in a series of outcome-based legal decisions of the new court of four.”\n\nWith advocates increasingly bringing the most politically charged legal fights to state high courts, races for seats on these courts have been transformed. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have already held elections in the post-Dobbs era of supercharged state judicial politics. Two years later, the trend of increasingly high-profile and nationalized judicial races shows no signs of slowing.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Running Point, Netflix’s hit new comedy series starring Kate Hudson as the somewhat unlikely president of a basketball team, is the kind of not-terrible-but-not-great-either programming we’ve become accustomed to in these Trough TV, “casual viewing” times. Come for its appealing cast (which also includes Justin Theroux, Jay “Lawrence from Insecure” Ellis, and New Girl’s Max Greenfield, among others) and its creators’ track record (it’s from Mindy Kaling and other veterans of The Mindy Project); stay because it’s easier than finding something else to watch. It’s not so different from most shows that way. But it does have one secret weapon going for it that other shows don’t have: Chet Hanks.\n\nHanks is, of course, the son of Hollywood institution Tom Hanks, and if you recognize him, it’s probably not for any good reasons: He has gone viral for doing such yikes-worthy things as speaking in a Jamaican patois and trying to make the phrase “white boy summer” a thing. (It did become one, but not in the way he wanted.) More darkly, in 2021, he was sued for domestic abuse by an ex-girlfriend, whom Hanks also accused of violence; it’s unclear what became of the case. The contrast between tattooed, AAVE-spouting Hanks and his beloved, all-American father has been noted since he first stepped into the public eye (with a rap remix in college, naturally), but it somehow never stops being jarring. Casting him as a basketball player who is also white, a rapper, covered in tattoos, and a magnet for controversy was a canny move on the part of Running Point’s creative team.\n\nHanks has acted before, quite a bit, in fact—he had an especially memorable cameo on Atlanta—so this role as point guard Travis Bugg isn’t totally out of nowhere. (It’s also not the weirdest casting choice in the Mindy Kaling cinematic universe: That still goes to getting tennis great John McEnroe to narrate her young-adult comedy Never Have I Ever.) Still, if you had told me a few months ago that Chet Hanks would be a series regular on a Netflix show in which he delivers an endearing performance, I’m not sure I would have believed you. Also hard to believe: The producers neither apparently wrote the role for him nor sought him out for it. Hanks told Esquire that he auditioned and pushed for it. Perhaps this is only more grist for my emerging fondness for him: Only Chet Hanks believed in himself enough to know he was perfect to play a character who is a lot like Chet Hanks on TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would be going too far to assert, as some already have, that Hanks is the MVP of Running Point. That implies that Running Point is winning enough to have an MVP, and it isn’t quite. But Hanks does acquit himself well. He’s at his best and most natural when delivering rude lines like “Is it cool if I vape?” while at a fancy dinner with his boss, Hudson’s character Isla Gordon. On a meta level, there’s some undeniable delight in watching Tom Hanks’ son and Goldie Hawn’s daughter act together, and their status as some of the world’s most famous nepo babies actually resonates well with the show’s themes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Incredible: Man With Extraordinarily Famous Father Thinks He Got Role Based on Talent Read More\n\nIt doesn’t matter, and is maybe even kind of funny, that Hanks does not have the physique of a basketball player. His character walks in that gorilla-like way of overly muscly dudes—though of course that could just be his own walk—and he looks right at home yelling out commands to his bros, like “Shoot it with a crossbow” while playing a VR game in his apartment (which is tricked out with a telltale Warhol-style portrait of himself). When he gets the chance to rap, it’s funny, though I wish his lines were a little punchier. As serviceable and entertaining as Hanks is here, I’d love to see what a show with tighter writing like Girls5eva would have done with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I guess, abstractly, I’m rooting for Chet Hanks now? If you’re at all interested in joining me in this movement, I suggest reading a recent Esquire interview with him where he says some affecting and even occasionally insightful things about his struggles with addiction, his childhood, and his very random-sounding hobby of watching sailing vlogs on YouTube. I’m happy for him. It seems like he was lost for a while there. Clearly he needed a better outlet for his energy than trying to make “white boy summer” happen, and he may have found it. For a while there, Chet Hanks was a societal problem. Running Point, if nothing else, offers a solution.",

        "title": "Oscars 2025: Anora’s Best Picture win is revolutionary in one major way.",
        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Anora’s awards fortunes have fluctuated so wildly the past few months that it can be hard to remember that, for most of awards season, it’s been the favorite. The movie is a Cinderella story and, in a way, its Best Picture win is too, given that just a month and a half ago, the presumed front-runners were The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez. But think back further and recall that Sean Baker’s live-wire adventure won the Palme d’Or at Cannes and spent much of the summer and fall as the movie to beat.\n\nStill, it was never a foregone conclusion. One enormous hurdle always stood in its lane to Best Picture: the sex. There’s never been a Best Picture winner so upfront about sex, so explicit in its portrayal of sex, so forthright about the woman at the center using sex as a tool. Anora isn’t a movie about a woman’s sexual pleasure, really—remember poor Ani trying to get Vanya to slow down for once?—but it is a movie about a woman’s sexual agency, and in that respect, its Best Picture victory is one for the ages. Best Pictures have contained war, gore, jokes, songs, fish-men, and birdmen. Comedies have won Best Picture, as have horror movies, fantasy movies, thrillers, science fiction, kitchen-sink realism, gay dramas, and Birdman. But you know what hasn’t ever won Best Picture? A movie about a woman and her sex life.\n\nNo movie has really ever come close. Midnight Cowboy, the legendary X-rated Best Picture winner, was shocking for 1969, but its very brief sex scenes are played mostly for comedy, and are much more about Joe Buck’s journey than that of any of the women he encounters. For decades after that, Best Picture nominees rarely even bothered coming up with a whiff of eroticism. Not until 1993—when Jane Campion’s The Piano, also a Cannes winner, surprised everyone with eight nominations, including Best Picture—did the academy embrace a film in which sex, portrayed explicitly onscreen, was a crucial element of the story. Though it won Best Actress, it lost Best Picture to Schindler’s List.\n\nAnd after that? Best Picture was a pretty arid category. Rose got a tumble in the back of a car with Jack. Viola made sweet candlelit love with William Shakespeare. In The Reader, Kate Winslet—her again—put the SS in seductress. Movies about characters really exploring the boundaries of the sexual world, even ones made by acclaimed directors—Eyes Wide Shut; The Piano Teacher; Secretary; Y Tu Mamá También; Blue Is the Warmest Color; Lust, Caution; everything Pedro Almodóvar made between 1987 and 2004—were relegated to the secondary categories, if they even got nominated at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut last year felt a little bit different. Poor Things, a movie about Emma Stone screwing her way across steampunk Europe—and enjoying it!—was the night’s second-biggest winner, taking home four statues. Of course, the only earth-shaking happening in Best Picture came from a 16.8 kiloton nuclear bomb over New Mexico, courtesy of a movie whose idea of exploring a woman’s sexuality was to unclothe Florence Pugh for 49 percent of her total screen time. Nevertheless! All the awards collected by Poor Things, with its joyous, slightly deranged sex scenes, suggested that things might be changing in the new, younger, more diverse—let’s just say it—sexier academy.\n\nThis year, it’s been notable that while Anora’s seeming support has wavered, you just haven’t heard that much from pundits judging the movie’s portrayal of sex, or critiquing Ani’s use of sex, or just asking questions about whether voters were too prudish to reward a movie with a heroine who bangs. The closest Anora came to this kind of backlash happened when Mikey Madison declared that she didn’t feel the need for an intimacy coordinator, which briefly seemed like it might be a scandal but was quickly eclipsed by every word uttered or tweeted by anyone involved in Emilia Pérez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate The Oscars Opened With a Performance That Was … Actually Amazing? Read More\n\nNevertheless, even as Anora attained front-runner status all over again, I remained worried that Oscar would reject this invigorating, funny, explicit film in favor of the gritty ’70s-style classicism of The Brutalist or the burnished ’90s-style classicism of Conclave. (Conclave, as a movie, takes a vow of abstinence, while The Brutalist seems to suggest that, if he takes enough heroin, a guy who struggles with impotence can in fact make his wife levitate.) But let’s hear it for the Oscars, for giving Best Picture—plus Best Actress, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing—to a movie that’s actually interested in how what’s going on below the belt affects its characters’ hearts and their fortunes. Thirty-one years after The Piano, the prudes finally lost a round.\n\nRead more in Slate about the Oscars.",

        "content": "How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Stoya and Rich here. It’s anonymous!\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI’m queer and have been coming out of my sexual shell in the past couple years after previously only having one sex partner throughout my 20s. I am an analytic person by nature, and have found that while I can navigate a lot of emotionally connected and committed polyamorous relationships, I really enjoy and regularly crave the novelty of new dick/strap/pussy—even if my emotional, romantic, and sexual needs are being met. But with a busy schedule, it’s hard to prioritize this without a plan, so I gave myself a target number of new hookups: one a month, or 12 a year. Not all months go as planned—some months, I see no one new. Others, I have multiple new partners. For me, it’s less about the body count than it is about committing to this new side of myself. It helps me feel less stagnant sexually. Also, I’m just a planner!\n\nUsually, I chat with people and get coffee or drinks with them as a platonic and separate hang before we have sex. I hear about them, their background, their preferences, safe words, triggers, testing, etc., but it is always with the goal of low-stakes, often time-limited hook-ups.\n\nI had an interaction recently where I mentioned this to another queer friend, and they were clearly offended by it. I couldn’t tell if having a specific goal number came off as objectifying or dehumanizing, or if I owe it to potential partners to detail all of this (including the goal). Am I supposed to go beyond the usual “Hey would you be interested in a time-limited primarily sexual relationship?”\n\nAny advice on how to move through this with kindness, compassion, and transparency for folks? Or is the issue with having a number like that?\n\n—Good With Google Calendar\n\nDear Good With Google Calendar,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon’t let one friend’s ambiguous, seemingly negative-leaning reaction to your way of organizing deter you. You have good reasons for setting goals here, and you aren’t particularly hung up on them. Plus, you don’t know why your friend was put off. It could have to do with their ideas of etiquette/decorum, but they may just as easily be jealous or insecure. If they feel that they couldn’t pull one body a month, or in contrast, know that they have way more sex than that and would rather be more moderate about things but are having a difficult time doing so, that could have colored their reaction. I know feeling judged can make things awkward, but ideally, you would have asked follow-up questions to understand where your friend is coming from. Sometimes people are able to give you valuable perspectives that may not have occurred to you, and sometimes people’s feedback is utterly worthless and based on their own prejudices/subjective experiences and can summarily be disregarded on sight. Only further information allows you to determine which category a specific reaction falls in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour description of the way you treat your partners is sound. It seems that you are straightforward about wanting a temporary/one-time hook-up. You talk to them and get to know them as people. They are presumably looking for something similarly fleeting. You don’t owe anyone, not even a temporary trick, a full biography or explanation of how you’re going about your sex life. They can glean that you are interested in casual, no-strings sex and should assume that if you’re having it with them, you could be having it with several other people. If someone asks you about your hook-up frequency, I wouldn’t lie. I don’t think you’re obligated to reveal any information that you’re not comfortable with, and they may reject you for your answer, but everyone’s got their system and I think respecting their comfort levels with your own honesty is the compassionate way to go about this. There’s nothing in your letter that I find unseemly or unfair. You are allowed to organize your life however you want, no matter what other people’s opinions are. This information might be best kept to yourself to avoid the kind of disrupting judgement your friend gave you, but you have nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

As another classic New England winter has set in, we’ve learned this place is so damn drafty and expensive to heat. But we’re both troopers! You put on your long sleeve tee, hoodie, thick socks and slippers, and throw another couple blankets on the bed. We really don’t mind, except where it’s impacting our sex life. I can’t help but yelp “get those cold hands OFF of me!” as soon as he gets under my shirt. What positions can be done under the heavy blankets without whoever is on top basically doing a weighted plank? Is this what assless chaps are for? Should we scour Facebook Marketplace for a poster bed with wool curtains, like an 18th century dutch merchant? Please help! (And please don’t use this in a Slate+ exclusive, we’ve got to save up for a high efficiency furnace!)\n\n—May to December Romance\n\nDear May to December Romance,\n\nYou’re going to have to experiment with the best positions for you. The one that immediately comes to mind is from behind with the penetrated party lying flat on their stomach and the penetrator lying flat on top of them. But that might be the “weighted plank” you are trying to avoid. In that case, try side entry, with both of you lying on your sides either facing each other or from behind, which I prefer. That way the thrusting won’t be hindered by blankets too much, as you wouldn’t be going up and down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yes, you can certainly try semi-clothed sex—a onesie with a butt flap or buttons in the crotch area could help (he could wear standard long johns that would allow access to his dick with just an undone button or two). This is not a heating advice column, but a few other things you can play around with that may be cost effective: space heaters, a heated mattress pad or blanket, or maybe even one of those tents that goes over your bed (assuming that they actually can keep you warm and aren’t just for show). There are also heated gloves and hand warmers you could wear before you touch each other, and heated jackets and vests you can don if you don’t want to crawl under 20 pounds of blanket. Having sex in a warm shower could also be a good way to bypass the drafts and chill of your bedroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nThe columnists behind our new advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work.

I’m kind of tiny, and it’s just too big and uncomfortable. It can’t be returned to the company I purchased it from since it was opened. How does one dispose of sex toys in an environmentally responsible way?\n\n—Saving the Earth One Dildo at a Time\n\nDear Saving the Earth One Dildo at a Time,\n\nGreat question! I had no idea, so I reached out to Lisa Finn, a sex educator for the sex-toy boutique Babeland. She told me that because of the biohazard status of something that potentially has bodily fluids on it, a lot of e-waste facilities will not accept sex toys. But some will, so what you’ll have to do is look up the e-waste facilities around you and find their lists of what they do/don’t accept. Be aware that not every e-waste facility that does accept sex toys will be so blunt about it—they may list the more euphemistic “personal massagers” in what they will/won’t accept. Finding an e-waste recycler around you that does accept sex toys may be a slow process (I found a master list on the New York City Department of Sanitation website and then realized I’d have to Google each one to see what they do/don’t take), but hey, at least it will test your commitment to green living. Finn adds that there are places that will take a vibrator only if you break it apart, remove any silicone coating, and take in the motor. “Be very careful with that if it is a rechargeable toy—you don’t want to accidentally electrocute yourself if you’re going to be cutting this thing open,” warns Finn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother option: Pass it along to a friend. “If you have a toy that is made out of a non porous material, so a silicone, an ABS hard plastic, a metal, a glass, something like that, if you have a friend that you’re close to, it’s easy enough to disinfect this entirely so that it’s completely sanitized and see if your friend wants it.” In not every friendship will it be appropriate to pay your vibe forward, but if you have a friend with whom you casually discuss things like sex and masturbation, this could work. But since you may have a hard time adopting out your rabbit, Finn presented another idea: “The great thing about internal vibrators is that they can always double as external vibrators,” said Finn, who suggested holding your rabbit like a wand and using the tip of the internal piece against the clitoris or nipples—also if your partner has a penis, you could use it as a stroker by placing the penis between the arms of the rabbit.\n\nFinn’s last suggestion: go “the unhinged route” and transform your toy into art. She told me that she made a coat hanger of upcycled butt plugs for a friend’s birthday. If you can figure out another creative use for your rabbit, it’s surely better than taking up space in a landfill somewhere.\n\n—Rich\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy wife and I recently opened up our marriage.

Submit it here!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI need help with my in-laws! I am the mother of a bright and wonderful 14-month-old daughter. My husband and I love her dearly, and she is the only grandchild in both of our families. My in-laws have been overbearing since the start. (They suggested my husband take my 60-hour old new born daughter away from me hours after we were released from the hospital so that my husband and our daughter could drive to greet them at the airport; luckily our family nurse backed me up with a firm “No! The baby isn’t going anywhere away from her mother for at least three weeks and also what are you thinking!?) There are too many instances to count.\n\nNow, the big problem is they have become possessive of my daughter, often referring to her as “their” baby, and being beyond doting and obsessive. I handle it as best I can and appreciate how many people love her, but even outsiders comment on how possessive they are when they yank the baby from my own arms when they see me look at the TV or multitask by trying to open a door or anything.\n\nThe straw that has broken the camel’s back is this: This week, on an overseas trip, they insisted that my daughter would have “alone time” with her great grandfather that she and I had never met. I said I wasn’t comfortable with that and why would she need to be alone with a 94-year-old man?\n\nThey said, fine, my husband’s mother would be with the two of them. I said I still wasn’t comfortable with that, as I’d never met this man, or been in his house, and why did my daughter need to be without me? No one could give me a straight answer. I ultimately said no, probably a thousand times, but happily agreed to visit the great grandfather together as a family.\n\nMy husband’s parents insisted I go to the store during our visit, and they demanded I leave my daughter behind alone. I said no, again. I said I would either not go to the store or take her with me. They all got very angry and even got in my face about it, saying I needed to go and just leave her. I seriously felt ill. I had such a bad feeling about why they needed my daughter alone without me. They said it was the wish of a dying old man to have as much quality time as possible with his only great grandchild, yet I said that 30 min at the store with her mother while we were there together another 4 hours shouldn’t be an issue. I took her to the store with me while they all shouted after me. My husband’s family is enraged, saying I’m selfish and need to “share” “the baby,” as if she’s a communal possession and not a young child. They so desperately wanted me away from her that I physically had to hold her tight in my arms and run out the door.\n\nWhen I came back, things were very tense and my father-in-law told me how much I had disappointed his dying father. I am creeped out. I don’t think it’s normal to demand and intimidate for alone time with a young child, especially in a foreign place and a foreign country. I want nothing to do with them ever again. I told my husband I’m willing to divorce over this, and I am. They’re very religious, particularly the great grandfather, and my gut tells me there was some sort of ceremony perhaps they wanted to do without me there. It all feels so wrong. I am so upset still, days later. My question is, what can I do? Can I legally block them from my and my daughter’s lives? My husband’s parents live in the states, but this happened overseas. My husband thinks I am overreacting and that they just want as much time with our daughter as possible, but it seemed much more sinister than that when I experienced it. I am very afraid of what they may be planning as this entire trip was planned well in advance. I am scared.\n\n—Get Them Away From Her\n\nDear Get Them Away,\n\nI am 100 percent on your side; what your in-laws are doing is beyond creepy and weird. You should dig your heels in and remind yourself that you are the mother here. No one can gain access to your child without your consent, and you sure as hell shouldn’t sign off on an old man you haven’t met spending time alone with your daughter. The caveat, of course, is your husband also has equal rights to your child, and if he wants to take your daughter to meet his parents, he can do that. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be very clear about your boundaries in terms of your in-laws.\n\nFor example, they can’t come to your home and snatch your child out of your arms. They can’t disrespect you by calling you selfish because you’re doing what any good mom would do in terms of protecting your child. They can’t demand time with “the baby” as if she’s community property, as you said earlier. Your husband should be onboard with all of the aforementioned points, but if he looks at you as a “drama queen” or someone who needs to “calm down and stop being so emotional,” then you will have a serious decision to make. I’m not saying you should serve him divorce papers right away, but I wouldn’t fault you one bit if you decided to walk away from the marriage if you do everything in your power to express how traumatizing this experience is for you and he simply ignores it.\n\nHopefully, through deep conversations and marriage counseling, it won’t come to divorce and your husband will stand up to his parents, but you should be prepared for everything. In doing so, I’d suggest consulting with a family law attorney to see what the laws are in your area regarding visitation by grandparents. No matter what you decide about your husband, you should know that without a doubt you’re doing the right thing by standing up to your in-laws.\n\n\n\n—Doyin\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI’ve been married for a little under five years.

Submit your own questions to Prudie here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nOver 20 years ago I had an affair with a married woman who became pregnant with my child. She reconciled with her husband and they raised the boy as their own. I have not had any contact with my biological son, at the husband’s request. No one in my family knows I have a secret son. Two weeks ago I found out my niece (my sister’s daughter) is engaged, and the groom to be is none other than my biological son! Prudie, I am livid that my son’s mother and her husband did not stop this relationship in its early stages. “No, Bobby, you can’t date that girl because she’s your biological cousin” is all it would have taken. I contacted the woman and she swore she didn’t know our son was marrying my niece since my niece has a different last name. I asked her what she planned to do to stop the wedding and she said she’s doing nothing! Our son doesn’t know anything and according to her, cousin marriage is harmless! Prudie, how do I bring this up with my niece and her parents? I have never had any contact with my son and I don’t think I should approach him about it. He doesn’t know his father is not his biological father. I don’t want my niece to live in incest because of my past mistake, Please help.\n\n—Possible Cousin Marriage\n\nDear Possible,\n\nThis is an opportunity to repeat my frequent reassurance to fathers: Dads, a statistically significant percentage of you actually have sired the children you think are yours.\n\nThere’s no reason to doubt the mother of the groom when she says she didn’t realize the bride was related to you, especially if there’s been no big family gathering to celebrate the impending nuptials. You think you have a simple, easy way for the mother of the groom to stop the romance by saying, “Bobby, your father is not your father, and your fiancée is your cousin!” But if you think this through, explaining all this will entirely upend his family, and now yours, and at this late date in the wedding planning you can understand that the parents want to stick with their original plan to keep quiet about Bobby’s biology. I do think that people are entitled to know their origins and keeping these secrets has the potential for blowing up, as you are now seeing. But as it stands only three people know you’re the biological father of the boy, and while it may take all your will power, I think it should remain that way. Cousin marriage is common in much of the world and I think the remaining laws against it in this country should be repealed. Yes, there is an elevated risk of passing on genetic disorders, but it absolute terms it is very small. Two young people are in love and planning to make a life together. I think you should let that be.\n\n—Emily Yoffe\n\nFrom: Kissing Cousins. (August 19, 2013)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

When I was a little girl, my dad was involved in a really bad accident and was burned over a large portion of his body. He lost part of one limb and has some serious disfigurement. He has been a great dad and I never think about it. A few weeks ago, my fiancé started acting strange when we talked about the wedding. I asked him what was up and he avoided the question. Then his mom called me out of the blue and told me that she didn’t think that my dad should come to the wedding. She thinks that he will upset the guests and “traumatize” any children who might be there. She is suggesting that we have a private family ceremony before the big blowout. I got upset and my mom asked why. When I told her, she said that she and my dad understand, which only makes me feel worse. Maybe my future MIL has a point, but I would really rather disinvite her than my dad.\n\n—Exclude Dad?\n\nDear Exclude,\n\nYour fiancé is not so amazing if in response to his mother’s outrageous, sickening request he didn’t immediately say to her, “Mom, Elise’s dad is a great person. That he has overcome a terrible trauma makes me admire him even more. You need to permanently drop this. He’ll not only be there, he’ll walk her down the aisle, and I don’t want to hear another negative word about him.” Instead, he has weaseled around, and presumably didn’t tell his mother not to make her despicable request to you—he surely knew what she was up to and didn’t even have the courage to warn you. Instead of responding to his mother, you need to talk this through with you fiancé. He should be the one to respond to his mother about this, and it’s not too late for him to make clear she is totally out of line. How he handles this will tell you if he’s worthy of becoming a member of your family. And I hope you tell your parents that if they are not both at the wedding and treated as guests of honor, you won’t be there, either.\n\n—E.Y.\n\nFrom: Keeping Up Appearances. (August 6, 2013)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nA few months ago I decided to send my ex-husband a book I’d read, simply because I thought it would interest him. In an e-mail to him at work, regarding another issue, I mentioned that I’d mailed said book. A few hours after sending the e-mail, I got an e-mail from his wife (!) saying, “For the love of God, [insert name here] would you stop sending my husband gifts?”\n\nThough her reaction would indicate that I send her husband weekly tributes, such is not the case. And I don’t consider a used book to even be a gift. I’ve always felt I should maintain a friendly relationship with my ex, for the sake of our son. I also, up until this incident, thought very highly of his wife. At the time of this incident, my ex had no comment nor did he respond to my question of “What gives?” More recently, when pressed, he said that his wife is “funny” about my treating them like normal people. Was what I did so wrong?\n\n—Maddened\n\nDear Mad,\n\nHmmm, many ex-wives throw the book at their former spouses, whereas you merely sent one. And, no, you didn’t do anything wrong if you’ve reported the episode accurately. (Some ex-wives drum up excuses to be in contact for the sole purpose of annoying the new wife.) Your successor is obviously thin-skinned where you are concerned—not all that unusual if the new wife is insecure or jealous of any residual affection for the first wife.\n\nThe e-mail she sent you seems rather intrusive, if not ball-busting, but forewarned is forearmed. When you need to communicate with your child’s father, call him on the telephone—at the office—and ix-nay on the e-mail. It sounds as though he has his hands full. Too bad this is the way it is, but this is the way it is.\n\n—Margo Howard\n\nFrom: Ex-Wives and White Elephants. (May 4th, 2000)",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi\n\nHello, Pam Bondi? Is your agency being weaponized?\n\nThat’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s question for the head of the DOJ, after Trump border czar Tom Homan threatened her for hosting a webinar with the Immigrant Defense Project, an advocacy group that offers legal aid to migrants, in which folks were educated on their legal rights, in case they encounter Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Homan said he emailed the deputy attorney general, asking them to look into whether the representative was somehow obstructing justice.\n\n“Is that impeding our law enforcement efforts? If so, what are we going to do about it? … Maybe AOC is going to be in trouble now.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez rejected the idea that informing people of their rights is “impeding law enforcement.” She wrote on X, “Maybe he can learn to read. The Constitution would be a good place to start.” Homan, again on Fox News, said he is “well aware of the Constitution, but I am also aware the DOJ gives legal interpretations on issues like this to ensure ICE acts in accordance with the law.”\n\nOn Friday, AOC took things up a notch and penned a letter to AG Pam Bondi, demanding confirmation of whether she and/or her office were in fact under federal investigation. “Over the past two weeks, ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan has gone on multiple forums threatening political prosecution against me, citing resources I distributed informing my constituents and the American public of their constitutional and legal rights,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate He Was the First Man Donald Trump Picked After the Election. He Might Be the Biggest Disaster of All. Read More\n\nThe representative also reminded Bondi of the First Amendment right to free speech, noting that Vice President J.D. Vance recently said, “We may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Mr. Homan’s repeated attempts to use your agency to politically intimidate duly elected officials are a textbook threat to the right to free speech in the United States,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote. “Threatening criminal proceedings for exercising the First Amendment is itself a violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nAOC’s full-throated response to the Trump administration is a stark contrast to how her party has been handling Trump 2.0. Democrats have consistently been losing public confidence, even before Trump took office. A CNN poll from early January found that Democrats had a 33 percent approval rating. By February, that number had sunk to 21 percent, in a separate Quinnipiac poll. The party has been widely criticized for sitting quietly on the sidelines while Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders targeting immigrants and LGBTQ+ rights and gutting federal agencies.\n\nDemocrats have slowly started to raise more of a stink. Last week, California Rep. Dave Min introduced legislation (by the groan-worthy name of the BAD DOGE Act) to rein in Elon Musk, who’s been spearheading the Trump administration’s mass firing of civil servants—but it has little chance of moving forward given the GOP’s majority in the House.\n\nMeanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez has taken a different approach. She’s been leveraging her social media prowess and communicating about what the president’s administration is doing and what it means for her constituents across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Now the Democratic firebrand has shown she’s also not afraid to engage in a public showdown with the president and his cronies. Her party should be taking notes.",

(It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nAfter a traumatic brush with death, I decided to take a long overdue look at my life. I quit my high-stress job and went to connect back to my roots. I moved home, have started seeing a counselor, and took up volunteering. My finances are large and stable. I have passive income from renting out my old home and living with my parents. Only my siblings seem to assume I only exist now to be the personal chauffeur for their children. I am doing “nothing,” so I can take my nephew to soccer, my niece to dance, and do all the school drop-off and pick-ups at the drop of a hat. Neither of my parents can drive well but get stressed if I refuse, and then tell my siblings they will do it instead. So I get guilted into going. My siblings know exactly what they are doing.\n\nThey never asked our parents for all these rides until I moved in. I am trying to rebuild my life here, and my siblings are just trying to get something out of it. It is straining my relationships with my entire family. I feel I am talking to brick walls.\n\n—Where Is My Village\n\nDear Village,\n\nSince money isn’t an issue for you, one option would be to pay for a couple of hours a day of a local high school or college student’s time, and set a regular schedule for them to ferry the kids to and from activities. Of course, that’s above and beyond what anyone could reasonably expect of you, so if it doesn’t feel like a good solution, don’t do it. The next possibility is to simply say “No, I’m not available.” If you choose to give detail, you can explain your volunteering and therapy schedule. It will be difficult to deal with the feelings that follow—namely, your stress about your siblings’ negative reactions, and your concerns about your nieces and nephew’s safety in the car with your parents. I understand that won’t be easy. But look at it this way: You’re either going to be stressed while focusing on rebuilding your life in the way you planned (and setting the expectation for how you expect you to be treated) or stressed while doing what everyone else wants you to do. I’d choose the former.\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy husband is a man of excellent character. We don’t keep secrets from each other; we even share our passwords. We’ve been together four years and married for one. A month ago, my best friend, who is quite large-chested, stayed the night at our house. The three of us had quite a bit to drink. In the morning my husband sat me and my friend down and made a confession. He said he had put his phone in her bedroom hoping to make a video of her getting undressed, but he forgot to hit the record button. He said he was telling us because he felt so guilty and that he was sorry that what he intended to do was so super creepy.",

Just seven blocks over and five blocks up from where the shell casings hit the sidewalk, they gathered for gaiety in a glitzy ballroom.\n\nThe occasion was the 2025 PRWeek Healthcare Awards, a celebration of the sector that crafts the public’s perception of pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, health care insurers and care providers—through advertising, lobbying, corporate outreach, and so much more. Cocktail attire, please.\n\nIt had not been the best year ever. There was, obviously, the public relations disaster of Thompson’s murder. There was also the looming specter of an antagonistic new health secretary installed by Donald Trump. Corporate profits for insurance giants were high, sure, but not the highest. Drugmakers’ stock prices had been flagging.\n\nNot to say there weren’t standouts. Eli Lilly, the country’s largest pharmaceutical company, reported $45 billion in revenue in 2024, a 32 percent increase over last year. The company’s net income was up 102 percent since last year. Their profit margin leaped from 15 to 24 percent. Also, the company, along with strategic communications firm Porter Novelli, was shortlisted for an award: Best in Media Relations, for the launch of Kisunla, a new drug for Alzheimer’s that costs patients $32,000 per year.\n\nThe insurance giant Cigna, on the other hand, had seen its net profit drop from more than $5 billion in 2023 to just $3.4 billion this year. But it, and its in-house team, were up for an award, too, in the category of Best in Mental Health and Well-Being, for a holistic health survey referred to as the company’s new “Vitality Index.” (The findings were not altogether rosy: “Americans report downward shifts in physical, emotional and financial dimensions of health,” it stated. But also, “optimism is increasing.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnitedHealth, meanwhile, brought in a record $400.3 billion in revenue in 2024, and notched a best-ever adjusted profit of over $25 billion, but incurred a lot of costs dealing with cyberattacks, which brought down the final haul. And then, as we all know, someone—maybe a random twentysomething gunman with back pain, allegedly—offed the company’s CEO and then escaped the city without hassle, and a huge percentage of America said, Well, he’s got a point. So that was really bad, especially as far as relating to the public goes. UnitedHealth was not nominated for an award. No one from the company appeared to be at the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI arrived at Gustavino’s, the tony East Side venue, midway through the 6 p.m. cocktail hour. There were no menacing bodymen, no armed guards. “I looked for that, too,” said John Digles, of Ascent Strategy Group, nominated for Outstanding Agency Professional. “At J.P. Morgan in San Francisco”—that’s the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, held in January, the largest and most consequential health care gathering of the year, whose title sponsor should tell you a thing or two about the priorities of the health care industry—“there was heavy security.” This time they didn’t even check ID. “Would you like champagne?” I was asked right upon entry. Why, yes, I would.\n\nPublic relations—advertising, communications, crisis response—is an essential part of the American health care industry. Americans pay by far the most for health care of any country, have the most expensive prescription drugs, and, for all that, still have the worst health outcomes among high-income countries. When you’re wringing billions of dollars in profits out of the sickly, you’ve got to put some money into massaging public opinion. That’s just smart business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the awards’ own event page: “Healthcare is an essential part of the PR economy, making up around 35 percent of large agency revenues. It spans pharmaceuticals, hospital systems, public health, medical devices, care providers, health technology, digital health and health equity.” Of all the different types of PR—and there are many—health care is one of the “biggest, most dynamic, innovative and important.” It provides “inspiration everyone can learn from.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, the PR industry needs the health care industry. And the health care industry needs good PR.\n\nIn 2023, according to one Harris Poll survey, more than 70 percent of U.S. adults reported feeling that the health care system was failing to meet their needs in at least one way. Health care spending has continued its expensive skyward climb: In 2000, total health expenditures in America reached $1.4 trillion; by 2023 that amount had more than tripled to $4.9 trillion, easily outrunning inflation. (In 1970 it was $74 billion.) There are the age-old indignities of premiums and copays and costs seemingly all going up all the time. And then there are the endless new pain points for Americans—the rejected claims, the surprise billing, the groveling for coverage in the face of capricious, error-plagued, and rejection-heavy A.I algorithms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s perhaps no coincidence that a 2021 study by AHIP, a health industry trade organization, found that 7 of the 10 biggest pharma companies spend more on advertising, marketing, and sales than they do on research and development. And here I was, swilling cocktails with the people who make it happen.\n\nAt a table near the bar, I spoke with Heather Schwanke, a marketing professional in client management. “Was it that nearby?” she responded, when I asked if she was concerned about returning to the place of the CEO hit. “I was leaving a Starbucks this morning and I was like, I hope it’s not this one.” I asked her what she thought the general mood of the industry was. “It’s a tricky time,” she told me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s not just because of the killing and the subsequent lionization of Luigi Mangione, the man charged with—not convicted of!—having done it. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was recently confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services, is not just hostile to the health industry, but has pledged to banish big pharma from television advertising. Despite the fact that he is a conspiracy theorist, swollen with bad ideas, this particular stance—that big pharma shouldn’t advertise—could be good for consumers. According to the New York Times, pharma firms tend to make five times as much in sales as they spend on those commercials. But research has also found that the majority of the most advertised drugs between 2015 and 2021 offered little to no medical benefit compared to existing treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA person could maybe argue that it’s good for Americans to know what drugs are available and on the market. But the United States and New Zealand are the only countries of the 193 recognized by the U.N. that have not functionally made drug advertisements illegal. Pharmaceutical ads tend to overstate benefits and downplay side effects and costs, encouraging vulnerable people to diagnose themselves and ask their doctors for pricey, sometimes unnecessary meds. In general, companies actually spend more money on advertising drugs that are less effective in clinical studies; according to recent research from Johns Hopkins, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for every 1.5 percent increase in ad spending, there’s a 10 percent increase in sales. In laymen’s terms: The advertising works selling some drugs that don’t. Meanwhile, what few regulations exist are now being gamed by telehealth startups who hawk their meds online. It’s happening in everything from ADHD medication to psoriasis treatment, all of which can lead to overprescription, which is great for profits but not so great for health outcomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlready, Schwanke told me, firms like hers were scrambling to provide guidance and reassurance to their clients about ways to circumvent possible future restrictions on advertising, including relying more on “broadcast news stories.” If RFK Jr. was successful in his quest to banish pharma ads on TV, “that would be a huge change,” she told me. “But we can still get the message out for your drug.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sharply dressed queue of people lined up for red-carpet photos in front of a step-and-repeat banner emblazoned with logos of corporate sponsors. Guests snacked on canapés and hors d’oeuvres before proceeding upstairs for the main course. A battalion of waiters fanned out with salads and filled glasses with wine. The awards were announced while we dined.\n\n“This year’s entrants meet the moment and create real change, giving a voice to those who need a platform,” boomed the program’s emcee from the lectern. “You are setting the bar for what health care communications can achieve.”\n\nGenentech, owned by Roche, the world’s sixth-largest pharma company, kicked things off with a big win in “Best Content.” The standout campaign, produced by the advertising firm Syneos Health, was a feel-good musical combatting ableism called Most Likely Not To, which had cast actors with spinal muscular atrophy in a comedy-slash-romance centered on a high school reunion. The story focuses on the long-thwarted love connection between a nondisabled male actor and the wheelchair-using female lead. In the end, they kiss. Song and dance ensue and Genentech sells a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllegra, owned by pharma giant Sanofi, and Edelman, the world’s largest independent PR firm, picked up the A.I. award, for a campaign called Allegra Airways. Artificial intelligence was used to test air quality in the area of Allegra takers in real time: If the air was thick with wildfire smoke, smog, or pollen where an Allegra user lived, there would be responsive price drop, a “dynamic coupon mechanism,” a not-so-distant cousin of “surge pricing.” (Allegra for all in our dystopian wasteland!) There was even a web-browser component, accessible on mobile, that could help Allegra users chart a path through streets with the cleanest air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main course came. (I had an eggplant-heavy vegetarian special). AstraZeneca won an award for Best in Corporate. The anti-ableism musical won again, this time for Best in Media Relations.\n\nCigna, the biggest and best-represented health insurer at the event, did not take home the award for Best in Mental Health for its “Vitality Index,” even though that campaign had been paired with a million-dollar donation to certain Y locations, for teen and young adult programming—and not a moment too soon: According to the index, “Gen Z adults continue to report the lowest levels of vitality, driven by poor mental health and stress about finances, and 83 percent report experiencing negative impacts of social media.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the honor went to Bristol Myers Squibb, which won for a campaign for the company’s new schizophrenia drug, featuring the actor Taye Diggs. In the ad, he engages in a little carpentry while talking with his real sister, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. A clip of Diggs appearing on NBC News, in promotion of that promotion, was shown at the awards ceremony. “We need to change the conversation, because so many people see things on television that aren’t necessarily true,” he intoned gravely.\n\nColorful stage lights flashed on the terracotta tiles of Gustavino’s vaulted ceilings. At my table, there was some grousing about the dinner, which was, if we’re being honest, not very good.\n\nSanofi won an award for Best Public Affairs, for an ad campaign on Type 1 diabetes. Just two years ago, the company shelled out $3 billion to acquire a firm that specializes in Type 1 diabetes treatment, and a few months later found itself in federal court facing allegations it was acting as a “multifaceted monopolization scheme” to keep insulin prices high. It also faced scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission. This year’s PR effort—don’t call it a comeback!—featured Usher and NFL insider Adam Schefter traipsing around Capitol Hill and making a visit to the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anti-ableism musical got another award. “It really was a great show,” the woman seated next to me whispered.\n\nRelated From Slate Republican Lawmakers Are Debating Whether They Can Afford to Totally Gut Their New Base Read More\n\nDigles, of Ascent, was seated at my table; the Outstanding Agency Professional nominees were announced, and his headshot flashed on the projector screen, but he did not win. “There’s a shift in public relations,” he told me, when I asked what he thought about this challenging moment for the industry. “For health care, the shift in public opinion is significant. The trust factor is significantly different. We have to pass that test. Public trust has plummeted. Our business has to be more aggressive in addressing that. We have to go on podcasts like Rogan.”\n\n“The horrible thing that happened with UnitedHealthcare,” he said, “painful as it is for us as a business, it’s so important to listen and learn.” That the public had turned against the sector so resolutely that alleged gunman Luigi Mangione still had a fandom of supporters camping out overnight just for a glimpse of his shackled, sockless ankles—that his legal defense fund runneth over with donations, that the general discontentment with American health care seemed to have, in an instant, crossed over into white-hot violent rage. “It sucks,” said Digles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA gelatinous dessert was disseminated. Some bolted for the door; others made a beeline for the open bar.\n\nI inched over to the Cigna table to chat. Here, I figured I would find the most poignant thoughts on the Luigi Problem; UnitedHealthcare is Cigna’s peer and largest direct competitor, and was already off to a terrible 2025: Two weeks later the Department of Justice announced it was investigating the firm’s billing practices. I sat down next to three women and two men who had lingered at the table. I introduced myself and asked if, given all that had happened—and all that was to come, plus the location of the night’s events—they felt afraid.\n\n“Yeah, it’s serious,” one of them said.\n\n“I would direct you to ‘Let’s Make it Better’ on our website,” one said.\n\n“No comment,” said a third.",

        "title": "The White Lotus Season 3 opening credits’ hidden clues, explained by the designers.",
        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Every season of HBO’s The White Lotus is similar but different. There’s a new location and a new set of characters each time, of course, but all the guests tend to be drawn from the same spoiled cloth, ignorant to their privilege—and to the mysterious fate the hotel inevitably has in store for them. There’s a new theme song that takes elements of the original but still draws inspiration from the latest setting to remix it into something unique. And there’s a new opening title sequence with fresh art that’s stuffed with symbolism about the season to come.\n\nFor the show’s Thailand-set third season, which premiered in mid-February, the opening credits take viewers inside a painted mural we might see in a Buddhist temple. Figures in traditional costumes dance and pray, as wild animals stalk the scene. But gradually, as in seasons past, chaos takes over: Monkeys invade a temple, and crocodiles slither into palaces, while sharks and sea monsters attack sailors.\n\nStill, try not to be too distracted by the carnage, because scattered among the names of the cast and crew are clues about each character and their fates. Indeed, on TikTok and elsewhere, fans of the show have taken up the challenge of playing artistic detective, theorizing what Easter eggs could reveal about their favorite characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“People naturally love a good puzzle. One of the reasons they’re attracted to the show is this nature of trying to sleuth out what’s happening, including in the titles,” Plains of Yonder co-director Mark Bashore—who, alongside co-director Katrina Crawford, designed the opening title for The White Lotus—told Slate. “There are some clues in there—actually a lot … Everything means something. It’s thought through. It wasn’t done lightly on any character.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s really nice when people don’t hit that skip button,” added Crawford. “It’s part of your experience.”\n\nPlains of Yonder, a Seattle-based creative studio, designed the opening titles for all three seasons of The White Lotus, as well as for other releases like Amazon Prime Video’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and Netflix’s The Decameron. It was Bashore and Crawford who first pitched the idea to creator Mike White for the first season’s title credits to feature a series of wallpaper patterns inspired by the fictional Maui hotel’s suites (Palm, Hibiscus, Pineapple, and Tradewinds) that slowly reveal rotting fruit, slithering snakes, gnawing insects, and stormy seas befitting of the series’ escalating conflict. When the show moved to Sicily for Season 2, Bashore and Crawford then wowed audiences with a series of Italian frescoes that gradually devolved into scenes of sexual depravity and doom.\n\nIn each case, the goal is to extract key themes but build something new. “We really make a point of being tangential to the show as much as possible. You don’t want to be re-creating the show,” Crawford said. “But how can we create a little portal for you to enter the show? That builds excitement and kind of scaffolds up to the show? That’s something extra?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time around, the pair took inspiration from the season’s themes of spiritual transcendence and enlightenment. Inherent in that, Crawford said she believed, is the need to confront your natural instincts and inner animal. “How do you visually represent someone struggling with their moral issues? Like, ‘Do I do the right thing? Do I speak out?’ ” Crawford said. “We kind of had fun using animals to portray that inner battle.”\n\nThat’s why, Bashore said, the line between animal and man is often blurred in the sequence—quite literally, in the case of some of the half-human, half-bird figures that are shown, which are drawn from Buddhist mythology. Elsewhere in the titles, we see animals with anthropomorphic eyes and features, as monkeys engage in human activities like smoking, while humans perch in trees like monkeys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother key theme that the pair picked up on this season: surveillance and a sense that you’re never really alone. That’s depicted in titles showing people lurking in trees, animals stalking prey, and the windows through which many figures are shown staring out from. “There’s always this trouble around the corner, which is a little different than previous seasons,” Bashore said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne other difference from previous seasons’ titles? This time around there’s much more death explicitly pictured. The credits show tigers hunting people and deer, humans battling one another with swords, monkeys stabbing and slashing with knives, and sharks going in for the kill—all of which may portend multiple deaths, in multiple grisly ways, this season. “There’s a lot of ways to die in that title,” Bashore teased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo come up with their ideas, the designers were given seven out of the season’s eight episodes to read through, from which Crawford then created in-depth profiles for each character. With these, they can then construct a title card for each actor. Carrie Coon (who plays Laurie, one of three friends on a fraught girls’ trip), for example, is shown as an elephant separated from its herd, while Michelle Monaghan (Jaclyn, another of the friends, who also happens to be a glamorous actress) preens with her breasts out, as if performing a siren song. Sarah Catherine Hook (Piper, the middle Ratliff child with an interest in Buddhism), meanwhile, is shown meditating alone; Patrick Schwarzenegger (elder brother Saxon, an alpha bro) is depicted as a menacing creep; and Parker Posey’s medicated mother character, Victoria, takes the form of a monkey smoking opium. Perhaps most ominously, Natasha Rothwell (hotel employee Belinda, returning from Season 1) is depicted as an elegant crane unaware of danger lurking nearby in the form of a crocodile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething few people spot, Bashore said, is that this symbolism extends to the title cards for the crew. The casting directors, for example, are depicted over a troop of monkeys, while the costume director’s name pops up over a group of women in different costumes. The editor’s name is even shown next to a group of men chopping things with swords. “People stop after the actors!” Bashore said. “I’m like, No! No! No!”\n\nTo create the sequences, Crawford traveled to Bangkok to meticulously photograph the art inside three different temples. Using digital software, the designers then compiled elements of these, as well as their own creations, into collages where a figure’s outfit might come from one piece and a body part from another (a behind-the-scenes Plains of Yonder video depicts this process for Season 2). They also created a bunch of mini worlds within their sequence wherein the action could take place: a jungle, a village, a temple, a steamy lagoon, and battle scenes. Finally, a different set of designers worked to add three dimensionality, shadows, and movement to the images, so as not to end up with just a boring slideshow effect. The designers weren’t given the new theme song from composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer until quite late in the process, at which point the two camps worked in tandem to tweak things for the final result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Incredible: Man With Extraordinarily Famous Father Thinks He Got Role Based on Talent Read More\n\nNeither Crawford nor Bashore would reveal whether they know which character or characters might die this season. However, they did sense that the credits’ dark and shadowy atmosphere—one in which we can’t quite be sure what is real and what is not—is reflective of a sense of disillusionment and confusion that both the characters and audiences may experience.\n\n“It is our job to create a little bit of the unexpected so that you’re open to Mike White stories,” Crawford said. “If we’ve done our job, you’re coming not knowing what to expect. Like, Oh, nuts. We’re going on a ride.”",

You have to fess up, but I think you can do it in a way that isn’t totally embarrassing.\n\nAsk for a meeting with your superior, just the two of you, to discuss your assistant’s performance. You work most closely with Assistant, and it’s your responsibility as Assistant’s manager to share your observations, so this is a reasonable request. Acknowledge to your supervisor that you should have clarified earlier that Assistant wrote the report she praised. You presumably did have something to do with the report since you oversee Assistant’s work, so you could spell out who contributed what, and why the work surpassed expectations. (When you’re in a stressful work discussion, using corporate-speak like “surpassed expectations” shows that you’re taking the conversation seriously.) Bring in specific examples, beyond the report, of ways Assistant has contributed to your team’s work. If your supervisor gets suspicious and wonders if you’re having this meeting just to save Assistant’s job, it would be gracious to accept the blame for your supervisor’s limited impression of your assistant. Say that you took Assistant’s excellent work for granted and won’t do that in the future.\n\n—Laura\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy husband and I were married seven years before he unexpectedly died.

It’s anonymous!\n\nDear A.J.,\n\nI’m almost at five months sober now, and I’ve found myself getting tired and less motivated with AA. I did 90 in 90 and was so keen on it, and then I just hit a wall. I find myself just kind of bored with it all. I got a sponsor and started step work but to be entirely honest with you, I got sick of him calling. I have found myself ghosting his calls the past two weeks!\n\nI just can’t be bothered to talk about my sobriety. It’s not that I’m isolating and feeling depressed or anything. Quite the opposite. I’m feeling otherwise motivated with life, sociable with friends, starting a new course in horticulture, exercising and meditating twice a day. I’m doing all the “good” stuff and feeling great about it.\n\nIt’s not that I’m saying “I’m fixed! I don’t need AA!” It’s just more, I’m feeling a bit of sobriety-chat burnout. I just want to be normal and happy and talk about normal shit, like what books I’m reading, etc.\n\nI guess my question is did you ever feel this sobriety burnout? Do you get tired of always talking about sobriety and how you’re feeling ?\n\n—Bored but Not Drunk Yet\n\nRelated From Slate My Weight Loss Injections Are Having a Wonderful Side Effect. My Husband Wants Me to Quit Them. Read More\n\nDear Bored,\n\nSobriety burnout is real, especially since you’re in the early days, but you have also gone to 90 meetings in 90 days (“90 in 90”), so I’m not surprised you’re feeling punchy. Recently, I learned a little about burnout that has been very helpful to me: Burnout is temporary and conquerable. It requires patience and fortitude, two virtues you now possess thanks to your sobriety, even with only five months. Unless you are physically broken and unable to go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings anymore, you’re probably just experiencing regular old boredom, similar to eating the same toast and eggs for breakfast every morning for 90 days straight and then craving anything that’s not toast and eggs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also want you to know that it should not be treated lightly, because this boredom can unlock some old behaviors. Only you can answer what comes next—will you go ham and begin knocking back bottles and partying like a maniac right away? Let’s come back to this.\n\nI want you to know that I relate to your predicament. In my first year, I got bored of AA quickly, much in the same way you are now. It was too stodgy and repetitive. They’re asking too much from me too soon. And—what? “A Higher Power some choose to call God” is what sounds like something I would choose to call a cult.\n\nSpinning enough of a tale in my head, I formed a resentment against AA, which, since you are familiar with the program’s traditions and steps, is not so great for long-term sobriety, if you are going the AA route. After a couple of months, I became antsy and ranty, resorting to trying to convince other people who were either in recovery (and some not) that with some tinkering, I could probably improve upon AA to make it not only more tolerable but more exciting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy pitch? “Advanced Moderation.” My program of recovery rewarded anyone who stayed sober for 30 days with both a chip and a 30-day furlough to go out and drink like a civilized human again. After that 30-day initiation proving that you can successfully handle wine with dinner and beer at ballgames, you come back and begin 60 days of abstinence. If you make it to 60 Days, then you go 90 days. After a year, you start at 30 days again. This all sounds well and good until you add up the math and realize that no part of this is anywhere close to sobriety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou asked if I’m tired of talking about my sobriety. Early on I was, sure—like you, I wanted to talk about normal-people things. I was feeling fixed and rejuvenated, and also not like I was a sick and scary person in need of constant monitoring. Now, though, I love talking about my sobriety—live for it, frankly, especially when I’m talking with other people in sobriety. The reason is simple: I now have like-minded people in my life with whom I can reveal my true feelings, a power I’d lost somewhere during the 20 years of drinking and using. Instead of the truth, I’d have to concoct some lie or a cover-up. When someone asked me how I was doing, I’d tell them I was “fine,” no matter if I was fine or extremely not fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, I get to live and act in the specificity of truth, thanks to some of the camaraderie and friendships I’ve found in both AA and Adult Children of Alcoholics.\n\nFor example, if you asked me how I was doing right this minute, I’d tell you I’m “good, but feeling a little anxious and sad about flying to Philadelphia for my uncle’s funeral.” Whereas before I got sober, or even in early sobriety, I’d tell you I was “fine” and then bottle up the rest. When I shut down like that, I become more susceptible to acting out in destructive ways. I don’t possess the urge to drink anymore, but I can still make a mess of my life if I start lying again, even with unremarkable lies such as “I am feeling fine.”\n\nAfter emailing with you, though, I’m uplifted and genuinely having a better day and moment despite having to hop on a flight very soon. Thank you for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mentioned that boredom can unlock old behaviors. At this point, I’m therapized and program-focused enough that I can tell when I need other people to talk to, even though all I want to do is isolate and go dark. One of the first telltale signs for me is that I no longer see facial expressions. If I’m spiraling, the entire facial structure of whomever I’m talking to melts away into a flat, sanded-down surface, and I’m left guessing how they need me to respond or react to whatever we’re conversing about. I’m a very unfit fiddle in those moments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, as you learn more about yourself and how to spot warning signs, here’s how I’d suggest you get through this bumpy, droopy, dull patch of sobriety: Change up your program. Find new AA meetings to attend with new people, new books and activities to push yourself through this moment—new people to talk to. Achieving long-term sobriety isn’t easy, and you will be tested—sometimes daily—but I promise you’re killing it right now and doing fantastic, so hang in with us.\n\n—A.J.\n\nHave a question for A.J.?

But no group has been targeted quite as harshly as transgender Americans, who—due to an order defining sex in the government’s eyes as immutable from conception and including only “male” and “female”—have seen their very existence erased from the official record, and all manner of activities, from obtaining a passport and serving in the military to using the correct bathroom and playing sports, made impossible. The situation is dire, but there’s a glimmer of hope in the fact that these actions are likely (or plainly) illegal, and already, courts have issued holds and injunctions on some of the diktats in response to aggressive legal action by LGBTQ+ and allied groups.\n\nOn a recent episode of Outward, hosts Bryan Lowder and Christina Cauterucci spoke with Chase Strangio, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union and co-director of that organization’s LGBT & HIV Project, about what it’s like to be on the front lines of the legal battle against Trump and the progress of the cases in which he’s involved. In this excerpt, Strangio shares his thoughts about what’s to be done if Trump ultimately ignores legal rulings, the problem with the “trans debate,” the limits of what we should hope for from the law, and how queer and trans people can survive in spite of its shortcomings. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nBryan Lowder: The thing that’s keeping me up at night right now is this sort of Andrew Jackson theory, which Vice President Vance has been pretty actively pushing, that basically says, “So what if the courts decide against these executive orders and policies, who’s going to enforce it?” I think the quote is that Andrew Jackson said, “The chief justice has made his decision, now let him enforce it.” There are no Supreme Court police, I don’t think, that can come fix the websites or release the federal funding or directly remedy any of this stuff. So how do you, as a lawyer who’s actively litigating these cases, think about that threat of noncompliance? I know you talk a lot on your social media about the law being an imperfect tool, so I’m curious how you’re thinking about that nightmare situation and the limits of the law in general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase Strangio: I’m not someone who’s ever thought that the law was going to be our savior or our transformative tool for building the world that we want. And so I think that the role of law right now and the role of lawyers like myself and civil rights lawyers, constitutional lawyers, is to hold back the government, to hold back the harms of the government, so that people can exercise other muscles, so they can build other tools. I think we have to be very careful not to think that this is going to be an exercise in the courts being the thing that protects us. One of my big concerns about the first Trump administration was that in the first six months to a year, there was this sense that lawyers will save us.\n\nRemember, there was the stop to the Muslim ban originally, but ultimately that lost at the Supreme Court. There was the stop to the trans military ban, but that, too, lost in the end. And so the administration got more savvy. I think what happens is we can’t allow the initial legal wins we’re seeing right now, the injunctions to the EOs and so forth, to slow our other mobilizing progress because we need to be prepared for when the Supreme Court upholds the policies or when he defies the orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then we need to be in the streets. We need to build a different muscle here, because we can’t just simply say that the courts, the law, the legal work is enough. At a certain point, the system may not even work on its own terms, and many of us don’t think it is the thing that should be guiding us anyway. I want us to think about all the tools and be building them simultaneously and be ready for anything. If that happens, if the administration refuses to comply with court decisions, then there should be millions of people in the street. Ultimately, we are the enforcers of it. We are the ones who have to put ourselves on the line to protect against things that we think are abhorrent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo that’s one point. The other is that if you’re the person working within the system and doing reform-based work, which I necessarily am, I guess I’m just thinking one step at a time. We are a long way from a Supreme Court order that is either blessing these or that is being defied. So we have to be building the power within the work that we’re doing to try to delay the harms to keep people safer for longer. And within that time, help people recognize that part of their work is to find alternatives to the things that they were relying on in the past—people do need to find alternatives for caring for themselves. Unfortunately, I think that’s the reality we’re in. I mean, trans people I know who are my age and older, so 42 and older, have five backup plans. I do think people should, without being overly paranoid, be realistic and strategic. So that, I think, is the way that we prepare for those moments: The more we have our needs met by caring for each other, the more we’re going to be equipped to fight back against whatever is coming. We do not do ourselves any favors if we are just complacent and thinking, Oh, it’ll just be OK, because, what, American exceptionalism? That’s just not going to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristina Cauterucci: You’re talking about the need to be in the streets. I feel like a part of that is changing the public debate. And I think we’ve seen in some recent sobering and disturbing polls that the anti-trans movement has succeeded in shifting public opinion in a lot of ways on a lot of issues where people used to be supportive of, let’s say, trans people serving in the military. I think 70 percent of people were supportive of it a few years ago, and now it’s more like 50-something percent. You posted on Instagram recently about this idea of the “transgender debate,” which is a phrase that politicians and some media outlets will use. On a previous show, we talked about Meta, which recently decided to allow what I’d call transphobic hate speech on Facebook and Instagram with the excuse that, well, there is this transgender debate and it’s a political debate and we have to allow that debate on our platforms. What do you say to counter that contention that trans people constitute the subject of legitimate public debate?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s so insidious and it’s repeated so much. And I would just like to ask people: What is the transgender debate? I think we really have to ask people what that means, because it’s very loaded and anything that is actually being asked could be phrased in many other ways. And so my frustration is twofold. The first thing is that it begs the question, in the sense that I think the fundamental question is: “Should you debate something related to someone’s existence?” And if you frame it as “What is the transgender debate?” you’ve accepted the premise that you should. My second-order critique is that it really obscures what’s going on. Ultimately all of these questions are really about to what extent do people want there to be broader cultural discursive and legal notions of how one can or cannot embody sex. And if you ask the questions in those ways, people, a larger group of people, necessarily have to think about their own stakes in both the question and the answer. And I think that by avoiding that, you obscure the fact that you can’t actually excise trans people from lots of legal protections without harming cis women in particular.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause the question is not asked that way, people don’t feel implicated in it; they don’t think that it goes beyond Can a trans person participate in sports? Well, that’s how the law works. So if you decide to exclude someone from a paradigm, you have to change the rules and you have to define who is in the in-group and who is in the out-group. And the implications for that are far broader than just for trans people. What I want everyone to be doing is asking themselves, What is this question about “debate” really? And what does it mean for me? What does it mean for others? And what does it mean for the world in which we live? I think this is a very deliberate attempt to make the question smaller so that those—Trump and Vance and this administration—can use people’s ignorance and dislike of trans people to build executive power to entrench gender norms in a very aggressive way and move us towards the sort of authoritarian regime that they’re building. This is a classic move, in that we see it around the world in other authoritarian states, and that’s my frustration with the “trans debate” on some level. It’s like I’m not even personally offended. I’m intellectually offended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s also the very solid legal argument that this is literally sex discrimination. If you boil it down to, OK, well, what clothes do you have to wear to be seen as a woman? If somebody who thinks that a trans bathroom ban is going to magically keep bathrooms safe for cis women, have you experienced being a butch cis woman going into a women’s bathroom? You are opening the door for all manner of people to be harassed.\n\nIt’s always so baffling to me when I’m like, Well, then how are you going to enforce and conceptualize this paradigm in a way that only trans people are harmed? And again, I don’t think if you could, that would be ethical or lawful. It’s just also impossible, because at the end of the day, there’s no way to police the way trans people can live in the world without policing the lines of manhood and womanhood. And that is going to affect everyone. And we know that to be true if you stop and think about it for 15 seconds. I just want people to be a little more discerning here.",

Only nine days in, a horrific midair collision between an American Airlines jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter ended a 16-year streak without a fatal U.S. airline crash. Then, two days later, a medevac jet nosedived into a busy Philadelphia street, killing all six aboard and one person on the ground. Then, a week later, a private jet slammed into a larger parked jet while landing in Arizona, killing the first plane’s pilot. And a week after that a Delta flight flipped upside down while landing in Toronto.\n\nWas the Trump administration directly responsible for the surge in air disasters? The timing seems uncanny, but no. Whatever his flaws, Trump plainly does not deserve blame for this particular mess, which stems from a combination of bad luck and institutional failings that have been accumulating for years.\n\nWhat is also plain, however, is that since it has come to power, the Trump administration has been aggressively pursuing policies that will make travelers’ odds inevitably worse. So is commercial aviation still remarkably safe? Yes. Is it about to get dramatically less safe? Also yes.\n\nHere are some of the problems that already exist, and why they’ll get worse.\n\nFailure to Regulate\n\nA challenge in industrial safety is the tendency of powerful players to infiltrate and undermine their regulators. This dynamic has been playing out to dangerous effect in aviation, where Boeing has become such a dominant force that it’s been able to literally write its own rules. Starting in 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration launched a program under which it allowed Boeing to self-certify that its aircraft designs and production were safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s easy to see what that arrangement might have initially delighted Boeing’s C-suite, but it proved dangerous, both for Boeing’s customers and for the company itself. Two brand-new 737 Max airliners crashing in 2018 and 2019 annihilated public trust in Boeing, and the company has struggled to find its footing ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil now, at least, everyone agreed that regulations are important for aviation safety. The new administration doesn’t see things that way. Trump started his current term with a promise to dramatically slash regulations, proclaiming that “whenever an agency promulgates a new rule, regulation, or guidance, it must identify at least 10 existing rules, regulations, or guidance documents to be repealed.” By wiping out government regulations across the entire industry, the administration is asking aircraft-makers and operators to follow their own rules. Historically, that hasn’t worked out well.\n\nUnderstaffing\n\nThe problem of understaffing at the FAA is one that has troubled experts for years. In 2023, the New York Times revealed that near misses between airliners have become endemic at airports across the country, “a sign of what many insiders describe as a safety net under mounting stress,” with a leading cause being “mistakes by air traffic controllers stretched thin by a nationwide staffing shortage.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstaffing is not a problem that worries the Trump administration, however. As part of its project to massively slash the size of the government, it laid off some 400 FAA workers starting on Feb. 17. At the time, it said that none of the firings involved air traffic controllers. But five days later Musk posted to X that any federal employee that didn’t write an email explaining what they’d done during the previous week would be fired. If enforced, this diktat will likely ensnare some air traffic controllers from towers that can hardly afford to lose them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there’s a broader issue, which is that a great many FAA employees—not just air traffic controllers—positively affect aviation safety. Some of the FAA employees fired earlier this month, for instance, were charged with updating the navigational charts that help keep pilots clear of danger. If the prime motive of the Trump-Musk alliance is to gut the federal workforce as thoroughly as possible, that’s going to have all kind of deleterious effects, up to and including twisted smoldering wreckage.\n\nForeign Adversaries\n\nHistorically, the aviation industry has focused on preventing accidents by removing the risk of equipment malfunction and human error. Over the past decade, however, a whole new source of danger has emerged: foreign adversaries who attack civil aviation as part of a broad campaign of disruption against the democratic West. By far the worst actor in this space has been Russia and its proxies, which, since 2014, have shot down two airliners, pirated another, blown up a private jet, and waged internecine electronic warfare against airliners in northern Europe. Most ominously, last year Russian intelligence operatives began planting incendiary devices in air cargo shipments, a move that so alarmed the Biden administration that it warned the Kremlin that it was risking an all-out war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Meet the Disabled Vets, Cancer Researchers, and Nuclear Techs Fired by Elon Musk Read More\n\nTo say that Trump is unlikely to push back against this particular threat is an understatement. It was, after all, Russian intelligence that helped him come to power in the first place, and during the beginning of his second term, the United States has quickly swung from adversary to overt ally of the Kremlin. At the same time, Trump has dismissed members of an advisory committee at the Transportation Security Administration that helped protect airlines and airports against foreign attack. Should an attack take place now, it would be hard to distinguish between foreign aggression and self-harm.\n\nFor the time being, America’s air transportation system still provides one of the safest forms of travel available. But that safety has taken great expense and patience to achieve. This carefully tuned system is now being actively dismantled by people who don’t understand how it works and don’t value what it does. Like a house whose beams have rotted from within, once air travel starts to fail, it will fail dramatically.",

She constantly complains about my brother not doing “enough” to help out or support her career and goes on and on about the kids driving her crazy. Then she turns around and tries to shill motherhood like she is trying to save sinners at the Rapture. But now it’s gone too far.\n\nI am her favorite target. I am a single woman and in a creative career that requires constant travel. When I visit, my sister-in-law brings it up in every conversation (I have kept track). I usually try to laugh it off, but I just turned 35 and my sister-in-law acts like I am a jug of milk about to expire. On my last visit, my sister-in-law physically grabbed me and told me my fertility was not some “joke” and I needed to get serious about having kids because I would regret it. I yelled at her to get her hands off me and told her she was mentally cracked if she thought I wanted to hear her opinions about the state of my vagina. I told her to go look in the mirror and ask herself why she is so constantly miserable and determined that every other woman needs to be the same.\n\nShe gets into her mommy martyr mode but this time, my family finally backed me up. My mother told my sister-in-law she was way out of line and she needed to learn to drop the subject. My other brother repeated that my sister-in-law was acting disturbed over the subject. The problem is now my sister-in-law refuses to let anyone see the kids from my side of the family because we all attacked her, and demands that I apologize to her personally. I am getting a lot of pressure to be the bigger person and let it go. I have done that for seven years and am sick and tired of walking on eggshells. I am usually a live and let live person but she never lets up. Help!\n\n—Finally Snapped\n\nDear Snapped,\n\nI keep scanning and re-scanning this letter, looking for any mention of anything your brother—the one person in this story who’s both related to you, and married to this lady—has done to mediate or handle this conflict. I don’t see it! But isn’t it your brother who can speak to your sister-in-law and convince her that cutting the kids off from half of their grandparents, aunts, and uncles is an overreaction to what all went on at this gathering? Isn’t it your brother who could tell her that he actually isn’t comfortable with her putting her kids online, and complaining about him to thousands of people, in service of her influencing career? Come in from the golf course, brother! Join the party!\n\nThat being said, you don’t need to negotiate with terrorists, here. Your attitude toward her is a little bit over-the-top—certain keywords like “mentally cracked” and “mommy martyr mode” are giving me a bit of a chill, like you’ve dehumanized this person and written her off completely—but it’s never, ever polite to buttonhole anyone about their fertility and future plans for it. Stay strong on that front, and if family members keep asking you to apologize, refuse, and redirect them to … your brother.\n\nOh, and you should definitely stop consuming her content. You two are polarized enough. I’m sure her Reels or TikToks are unintentionally funny—good fodder to send to the group chat so everyone can have a laugh—but I suspect that when it comes to the conflict between you, your deep knowledge of her weak-ass influencing persona isn’t helping. For the sake of keeping a relationship with your brother, nieces, and nephews, I think you should hit “mute,” sooner rather than later.\n\n—Rebecca\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI am in my early 30s and still unsure if I want kids. My partner feels the same. I am career-focused and have an active social life, so while I’ve always wanted a kid theoretically, it’s not something I feel willing to jump into if I’m not 100 percent sure. I think I would be perfectly fine if my life turns out to be childless. My mother, however, is absolutely dead-set on a grandkid.

My issue is I don’t know how to dress appropriately for my level of seniority.\n\nI’ve never had an executive-level job before! In my past jobs, I always wore heels, jeans, and a sweater or blouse usually with a cardigan over. On my first day, I wore a sort of deconstructed suit; black slacks, a houndstooth blazer, and a white blouse. That day more than five people told me variations of, “Oh you don’t have to dress like that, you can if you want but no one else does.” They were right … but only when it comes to the men.\n\nThe guys are basically finance bros. They wear slacks with those quarter zips or jeans with a button down, and they only dress up when we have board meetings. They wear hoodies and jeans on Fridays. The women, however, are a completely different story. The only two women who are at my level wear sky-high heels, pencil skirts, and fancy blouses or dresses every. single. day. Sometimes, I’ll see them in slacks on Fridays but almost never in jeans. I, on the other hand, would prefer my old uniform but I feel awkward and out of place. I am having a hard time fitting in with the dudes. I never work with the women (they’re in accounting and I’m in property management/legal) but I can’t wear the guy uniform. What is the female equivalent of the finance bro uniform?\n\n—Finance Chick\n\nDear Finance Chick,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m not completely following what the issue is here. When you wore the deconstructed suit, people told you that you don’t have to opt for formal office wear, but then you said that the women at your level are extremely dressed up. So the issue is that you want to be less dressed up, to be like the men, but also feel like you should be dressed up, to be like the women?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is making my head spin, so I can only imagine what it’s doing to you. Which is why my advice is to wear whatever you feel comfortable in. You’re not a finance bro, so don’t dress like one! It also seems like you’re uncomfortable wearing the sky-high heels and full-blown dresses that the other women in the office are wearing. So don’t wear them. It sounds like your “uniform” at your old job—heels, jeans, and a sweater or blouse usually with a cardigan over—would be perfect for your new job as well. It’s not too casual but also not formal.\n\nThis could also be a fun opportunity to define a whole new work style. Maybe find a couple of influencers on social media whose style you like—I recommend someone who has a corporate job, not someone who’s getting dressed every day to go to influencer events and parties—and see what they wear to the office and how they style it. I suspect that a couple of new pieces of clothing or accessories could give you the confidence to strut into the office with your head held high, and to ignore whatever comments your new co-workers might make.\n\n—Doree\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy boyfriend and I are in our late 20s and have been together for 10 months. Things have been great—he treats me very well and I feel so comfortable with him. Even my friends have noticed that I’ve been much happier and more confident since we started dating. I can see a future with him. There’s a minor issue on which I’d like to get your opinion. A few months ago my boyfriend mentioned that he shoplifts a lot of his groceries.",

It can look a bit like someone hit CTRL-F-Delete for these terms—which is, in essence, what many federal agencies did in response to the Trump administration’s order targeting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (also known as DEIA) programs.\n\nWhile the executive order was most clearly aimed at initiatives involving workforce diversity, among health agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration, another type of resource winked out of existence. Many of these agencies’ websites were effectively scrubbed of any information on diverse populations in medical research.\n\nClinical trials—and all the other studies that inform the health care each of us receives—have long had issues with most of their participants being cis white men. This lack of representation has allowed health disparities to fester, and in this new vacuum of information, these problems will only become more difficult to address. It’s also just fundamentally bad science. How can you understand the health of a whole population if only some kinds of people are ever studied?\n\nIn mid-February, I decided to leave a job I had loved as a science writer at the NIH, in large part because it seemed as if I would no longer be able to do the parts of my job that had once felt meaningful. Up until the inauguration, I’d been working on a team of bioethicists, educators, and clinical staff to develop resources about sex and gender in genomics research. Some of these resources were for the general public, aiming to provide clear and factual information in an era with mounting misinformation about the relationships between sex, gender, and our genomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther parts of this project were geared toward the people the NIH funds, the scientists and doctors who recruit participants and carry out clinical studies. We’d been putting together resources that covered both why it’s important to include people of diverse genders in medical research and how to do so effectively, such as by designing questions that don’t erase trans identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis project, however, came to a halt immediately after the inauguration. When, after I left, I went to see if any of the existing resources had survived, housed within NIH’s Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office, the entire internet presence of the office was gone, an error message in its place. As I write this article, this is still how it looks.\n\nThat office, like many others focused on inclusion in research, hadn’t even celebrated its 10th birthday. The information plucked off federal websites was part of a very recent effort to fix an old problem. We therefore don’t have to look far into the past to see the consequences of these executive orders on medical research.\n\nWomen were banned from participating in clinical trials from 1977 to 1993. This policy was put in place by the FDA for fear that if anyone became pregnant during a study, there could be unknown side effects for the fetus. As a result, new drugs and medical devices and even surgeries were tested only in male participants, and even before anything made it to humans, most medical studies used only male mice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis ban still has lingering effects on women’s health. Many drugs on the market today were studied only in cis men, and cis women are 50 to 75 percent more likely to have adverse reactions to medications. Recent studies indicate this stems from subtle differences in metabolism that weren’t accounted for during clinical trials because no female participants were involved. Even after the ban was lifted, the numbers haven’t exactly caught up. In recent years, women have made up about 40 percent of clinical trial participants among studies for common conditions like cancer and heart disease, despite being half the population who has these conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe numbers are less clear for other identities, such as race—federally funded clinical trials weren’t widely required to report demographic information until 2017—but the general consensus is that clinical trial participants aren’t representative of the entire population. And in many cases, the people left out are those most at risk for the condition being studied. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Black people accounted for 21 percent of deaths from the virus but only 3 percent of vaccine trial participants.\n\nTo help researchers—who are also often predominantly white and male—learn about and work to address these health disparities, the NIH, FDA, and CDC websites once housed a variety of fact sheets, guidelines, and reports, many of which are now missing. Working in a communications office, my colleagues and I helped draft resources like these and distribute them widely so that they could hopefully find themselves in the hands of researchers and potential participants alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd efforts from governmental agencies are likely no small part of the steady but incremental growth in diversity among research participants. The enrollment of clinical trial participants from underrepresented groups has been increasing by about 1.7 percent a year since 2000, according to a study that also found that federally funded clinical trials are better at recruiting more racially diverse groups than are trials led by private companies. Or at least they have been.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Jordan Crowley Would Be in Line for a Kidney—if He Were Deemed White Enough Read More\n\nIn addition to removing available resources, the Trump administration has directed scientific agencies to comb grants for words including women, Black, Latinx, and LGBTQ. In my last few days at the NIH, I was also told, in a directive passed down from a superior, that we were no longer allowed to use terms like health equity. (An NIH fact sheet titled “What Is Health Equity?” is, for example, now blank, with a note saying that it’s “under revision.”) The extent to which these policies will affect the future of medical research is unknown, and probably impossible to quantify, but it’s not easy to improve something you can’t even talk about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese directives will not only affect what federal agencies are able to do to increase diversity but are also likely to shake the trust of potential participants. Because if your identity is now a flagged word, how safe will you feel participating in a study that asks you to take a new kind of drug? Especially as some programs on the ethics of medical research have also gone dark.\n\nMany people already don’t trust government health agencies, and for good reason. These institutions have funded or carried out studies that have caused harm, especially to Black, Indigenous, trans, and disabled people. The infamous Tuskegee syphilis study, which ran until 1972 and resulted in the deaths of over 100 Black men, was led by part of the U.S. Public Health Service, which is now the agency known as the CDC. The Indian Health Service has a lengthy record of abuses against the people whose health the federal agency is supposed to protect, including sterilizing Indigenous women without their consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if the recent anti-diversity executive orders are eventually reversed, trust doesn’t grow back overnight. Parts of the FDA and CDC websites have already been restored in response to a judge’s order, including pages from the FDA’s health equity office that encourage clinical-trial participation among diverse participants. But some pages—like this one and this one—now display banners about how the information presented is “extremely inaccurate” as it relates to “the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes,” even though this is not the scientific consensus at all. How many people this will deter, no one knows, but it would give me pause in joining a medical study, to say the least.\n\nAnd how many lives these policies will affect is immeasurable. What we do know is that health disparities shorten life expectancies and lead to premature deaths that may have been preventable. But you can’t treat what you’re not willing to look at in the first place.",

        "content": "How political did the Oscars get? Not very. Whether because of a chill in the political air or a calculation that millionaires in couture are not the best messengers for cries of revolution, the winners at the 97th Academy Awards largely stuck to the script, thanking producers and agents and loved ones rather than using the platform to speak their minds. The “sex-worker community” was mentioned more frequently than was Donald Trump, and while Anora’s Sean Baker used his Best Director speech to advocate for movie theaters, it took host Conan O’Brien to quip that the movie might have struck a chord because “Americans are excited to finally see someone stand up to a powerful Russian.” And although Emilia Pérez won two Oscars, neither its director, composers, or Supporting Actress winner Zoe Saldaña so much as acknowledged the existence of trans people, let alone spoke up in their defense.\n\nTrue, The Brutalist’s Adrien Brody capped his Best Actor speech with a condemnation of antisemitism and racism and a plea for “a healthier and a happier and a more inclusive world,” but only after stretching several minutes past his allotted time, all for the purpose of delivering the anodyne kicker “Keep smiling, keep loving one another, and let’s rebuild together.” Daryl Hannah was more succinct, shouting out a quick “Slava Ukraine” before presenting the Oscar for Best Editing, but the moment passed so quickly the crowd didn’t have time to take it in.\n\nIt fell to the directors of the documentary No Other Land to make the broadcast’s most forceful political statement. The movie, shot over the course of several years in the West Bank region of Masafer Yatta, has four directors, evenly split between Israelis and Palestinians, two of whom—the Palestinian activist Basel Adra and the Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham—spend a good chunk of the film debating on camera whether it’s possible for either of them to fully engage the other’s perspective. Abraham is devoted to chronicling the Israeli army’s ongoing attempts to turn Masafer Yatta into a military training ground, bulldozing houses and schools to make way for tanks and soldiers. But as his Arab co-directors point out, he is in the West Bank by choice, and he can leave whenever he wants to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPointing out that disparity in an acceptance speech at the Berlin International Film Festival, where the film won the top documentary prize last year, led to condemnation by the city’s mayor. But Abraham repeated the same point at the Oscars, after No Other Land won Best Documentary Feature. “When I look at Basel, I see my brother, but we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free, under civilian law, and Basel is under military laws that destroy his life and he cannot control.”\n\nAdra, who spoke first, used the stage to condemn the Israeli occupation, calling on the world to “take serious actions to stop the injustice and stop the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.” Although it wasn’t audible on the broadcast, a reporter from Vulture heard someone in the audience yell out, “Get rid of Hamas!” But the crowd, which leaped to its feet when the award was announced, seemed firmly on the filmmakers’ side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his speech, Abraham stressed a message of unity: “We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger,” he said. “We see each other: the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end, the Israeli hostages, brutally taken in the crime of Oct. 7, which must be freed.” (Their co-directors, Rachel Szor and Hamdan Ballal, shared the stage with them, although they did not speak.) But he also made clear his view that the obstacles to peace between Israelis and Palestinians are not entirely of their own making, and in so doing delivered the evening’s strongest rebuke to the United States’ involvement in the region, which most recently has included promising to displace nearly 2 million residents of the occupied territory to make room for a global resort. “There is a different path,” Abraham said, “a political solution: without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people. And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path. Why? Can’t you see that we are intertwined? My people can be truly safe if Basel’s people are truly free and safe.”\n\nRelated From Slate The Part of Anora’s Oscars Triumph That’s Truly Revolutionary Read More\n\nFrom a medley of James Bond themes to multiple invocations of The Wiz, the Oscars leaned hard into old-school entertainment, and most of the winners graciously picked up their statues and went on their way. But No Other Land’s win served as a reminder that while movies can provide much-needed escape, the collective enjoyment we share in Baker’s beloved cinemas can be the seed for other coalitions, other kinds of energy. “It’s not too late for life, for the living,” Abraham concluded. “There is no other way.”\n\nRead more in Slate about the Oscars.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy wife has a 24-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, and we have a 10-year-old adopted son. When we got married, my wife made it clear that she and her ex were parenting her daughter and I was to have a hands-off stance. My stepdaughter was a good kid and we mostly got along, but there were several parenting choices that I really didn’t agree with. She had little in the way of funds for higher education, was a bright student but not full college ride material, and skipped most of the opportunities her school offered her (dual credit, community college courses, and AP tests). My wife and her ex ignored all of this, and I was told to butt out when I brought it up. The end result was my stepdaughter took out a ton of college loans and hasn’t managed to find a full-time job she likes since she graduated. She has lived with family or friends and is very frustrated.\n\nRecently, I finally got into a management position and have access to some very good bonuses. We’ve been able to upgrade the house, buy new cars, and put more money away for our son. Then my wife came at me with something I could not believe.\n\nShe wanted me to pay off her daughter’s loans. This was not a discussion, it was a demand. When I balked, she went straight to the emotional manipulation about how I favor our son and don’t treat my stepdaughter the same. I told her of course I don’t—she made it that way from day one, I don’t get an opinion. I pointed out all the wasted potential in the past and the fact that my stepdaughter job-hops the minute she gets dissatisfied.\n\nMy wife claimed that wasn’t fair. I said she can’t have it both ways, especially after this long! (We’ve been married eight years and together 12.) This is a huge wedge between us now. I offered the compromise that my stepdaughter move home, get whatever job she can find, and pay us market rent. We would save the money and I would match it if possible and we would then give it to her. My wife refused and called the compromise “controlling.”\n\nAt this point, I am ready to throw in the towel and tell my wife to go get a second job if she wants to pay for these loans. This is souring what should be a special occasion—we never got a honeymoon, so I wanted to take all four of us to Hawaii (my wife, me, my stepdaughter, and our son) this summer. Now I am waiting for the argument that of we go, the money was wasted and if we don’t, I am being petty and controlling. I am just at the end of my rope here.\n\n—Not the Bonus Dad, Just Step\n\nDear Bonus Dad,\n\nWhat strikes me about your conundrum is that it doesn’t really have to do with the step-daughter at all. That’s more so the “surface-level” conflict here: You don’t approve of the step-daughter’s choices (or the choices your wife and her ex made to parent her), but it’s been made clear that it isn’t your business to judge, anyway.\n\nThe deeper conflict is the one between you and your wife, and it concerns the question of how to spend your income, and primarily, who gets to decide—an age-old marital stressor. It sounds like you’re the primary breadwinner and have been for a while, so I would be curious how you’ve worked through versions of this conflict before. For example, when it came to the new house or the vacation destination, how did you make those decisions with your wife? Do you both refer to your income as “my paycheck” or is it “our household income?”\n\nIf there’s an existing precedent in your household where the breadwinner is the one who makes all of the big financial decisions, it’s logical to put your foot down. But it’s possible that such a precedent would breed a certain degree of resentment, which may be why your wife is reacting to this particular issue in this way. If she’s calling you “controlling” for withholding money for something she cares about—and this is how you’ve been conducting the finances of marriage historically—it’s not completely off base for her to be angry. I think you should do some thinking on your own about the expectations you may consciously and subconsciously have about your status as the family breadwinner, and then have a conversation with your wife about hers. If you’re not able to reconcile those expectations, it may be time to seriously consider the remaining feasibility of a marriage where you cannot come to an agreement about money.\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

For that matter, how do you pluck up the courage to say anything at all?\n\nI’m a 21-year-old woman and was recently asked out on a date by a guy at my church—which came as quite a shock to me, as I had no idea the guy was interested in me like that at all, though we had talked a few times. I said yes, and we had the date today, going out for lunch. It was nice, and he’s a genuinely interesting person. But I don’t think I’m interested in pursuing a relationship.\n\nWe have a five year or so age gap (I graduated school the year he started his PhD) and we’re just not at the same life stage. I also just don’t feel I know him that well! He’s very much interested in me, and I know I don’t share that same level of admiration for him.\n\nI’m also a very inexperienced dater—that date was, I would say, probably my first ever official date. I have no idea what I’m meant to be feeling, and I’ve been questioning lately whether I might be somewhere on the aromantic/asexual spectrum. Overall the whole situation is just stressing me out.\n\nI’m autistic and terrified of doing something wrong or hurting his feelings, though of course I know that’s inevitable. To make matters worse, I know I’ll have to see him at church from time to time too! The door is currently still open for another date, and he’s enthusiastic about the idea, but I don’t want to go on another date and lead him on, as that seems cruel. I’m already really busy in my last year as an undergrad student, and this is an extra layer of stress. Am I overthinking this?\n\n—Dating Rookie\n\nDear Dating Rookie,\n\nFor what it’s worth, even very experienced daters have trouble with letting someone down, especially if it’s someone who’s a genuinely nice person. But all you have to do is tell this guy—via text is fine!—something along these lines: “It was nice getting to know you over lunch. I enjoyed our date, but I think we’re better as friends. See you at church?”\n\nYou don’t have to explain why (and if he presses for a reason, you can just say something like, “We’re looking for different things.”) Keep it breezy and short, and then make a point to wave or say hi at church the next time you see each other, so that you’ve established a precedent for how neither of you needs to feel awkward about the lunch date. Rejection is not inherently cruel unless you make it so; just be honest and polite and thank your date for a nice way to spend a lunch.\n\nGet Even More Advice From the Dear Prudence Podcast\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nDuring the pandemic, I established a good relationship with the neighbors to the back of me. They offered to let me use their pool, and I let them park the RV their in-laws were driving because I have a long, curved driveway that is mostly hidden. (Our HOA doesn’t allow RVs on the street or to be visible.) This has worked out well until recently.\n\nThe in-laws lost their home due to a natural disaster and have been parked in my driveway for over two months. At first, it was only going to be a few weeks until they sorted things out with the insurance. Now they were making themselves at home and make vague excuses about when they were going to get going. I essentially have lost my entire backyard and personal privacy here. The grandkids are constantly coming and going. I caught the grandfather trying to use my water and power (he stopped the first after I reminded him I have cameras).\n\nI hit my limit when my cameras caught the couple letting themselves into my garage because I forgot to lock the side door. They claimed they just needed to do laundry and forgot to ask me. I was furious, and the argument with my neighbors ended with me saying the RV had to be gone by Sunday or I was calling the cops and our HOA. The RV left, but my relationship with my neighbors is nil. I’m wondering now if it is worth trying to repair or just let it go. I never thought it would get this far.\n\n—Good Fences\n\nDear Good Fences,\n\nGive it some time. I’m sure it wasn’t an easy time for your neighbors to put up their in-laws for so long; it’s safe to say that everyone’s nerves are probably frazzled, leaving no one in much of a reconciliatory mood. Obviously, things got out of control, those in-laws were not behaving at their best, and your goodwill was exhausted, but as your letter notes, these were slightly extraordinary circumstances for those in-laws. Take a few months to cool off fully, and then see if you feel up for inviting your neighbors over for coffee to revisit the ordeal and smooth your relations over.\n\n—Delia\n\nCatch up on this week’s Prudie.\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy sister is a young, successful woman who is dating in a major city. She is specifically dating for relationships—while she enjoys hooking up with the guys she dates, she’s not looking for situationships but for something lasting.

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAdrien Brody really ought to have thanked Halle Berry when he accepted his Best Actor Oscar on Sunday night. For 22 years now, she’s been publicly gracious about him forcing a kiss on her the last time he won an Oscar, and this year she went a step further by re-creating the kiss on the red carpet before the ceremony.\n\nThis all started at the 2003 Academy Awards, when it fell on Berry, as the previous year’s Best Actress winner, to present the Best Actor category. When Brody won, he got on stage and planted one on Berry. This was no blink-and-you’ll-miss-it peck; Brody held her close and even dipped her a little. The crowd roared. Berry did not appear to be visibly upset, and in fact looked like she was trying to play along with the moment, though she could be seen wiping her mouth off in the background later during Brody’s speech.\n\nThe reaction to this moment has been somewhat misremembered in subsequent years. It is not quite true, as USA Today has recounted, that “the moment generated controversy at the time, with critics characterizing it as a violation of physical boundaries and a muddying of consent.” The kiss has indeed become controversial in retrospect, but at the time, it was celebrated as the kind of fun, unexpected Hollywood moment that makes live TV and awards shows worth watching. (USA Today itself was in on it, calling Brody “swooningly smooth” in the aftermath.) In 2008, one writer reflected, “I’m still left wondering, even after all these years, why there wasn’t more controversy or fall-out surrounding this moment,” but her voice was very much in the minority. It took many years and an entire movement raising awareness about sexual misconduct in Hollywood for most people to reconsider the kiss, and by its 20th anniversary in 2023, it was indeed being described as “cringe-worthy” and “a scandal.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrody addressed some of the criticism about the kiss earlier this year in a Variety interview, ultimately offering a pretty evasive statement: “We live in a very conscious time, which is a wonderful thing. And nothing that I ever do or have done or would’ve done is ever done with the intention of making anyone feel bad.” For her part, Berry has never outright criticized Brody over the kiss, but she has shared how taken aback she was. “I was like, ‘What the fuck is happening right now?’ That is what was going through my mind,” she said on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live in 2017. “And because I was there the year before and I know the feeling of being out of your body, I just fucking went with it. But I was like, ‘What the fuck is going on right now?’ ”\n\nIt’s possible Berry feels completely unbothered about the original kiss; it’s also possible she knows there’s not much to be gained from her objecting to how she was treated, or being anything but a good sport. Her never calling Brody out on it makes sense from that perspective, but her taking an active part in re-creating it goes above and beyond that. As a moment of public relations stagecraft, the red-carpet redux was so well done that one is tempted to wonder whether anyone’s reps had a hand in it; after all, it makes them both look good. With Brody on his way to another Best Actor trophy this year, the timing was perfect, but Berry approaching him on the red carpet came off as casual and unrehearsed. She turned to Brody’s date, girlfriend Georgina Chapman, before leaning in, saying, “I’m sorry, Georgina, but I gotta do it.” The two locked lips and swayed for a moment, though Berry doesn’t hold Brody nearly so tight as he did her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA reunion 22 years in the making. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/MkaF2xb6SE — The Academy (@TheAcademy) March 2, 2025\n\nIn interviews, Berry called her kiss this year “payback,” and it is in the sense that at least she was in control of this one. But Brody benefits more, because Berry is effectively absolving him of any blame for kissing her without her consent all those years ago. If she’s so cool with it that she’ll do the same to him, it can’t have been that bad, right? It’s understandable not to want to get bogged down in criticizing Brody too much for a forced kiss, when there are so many worse things men in Hollywood do, but is it too much to ask that we not celebrate him for it? At the same time, does this mean I’m now criticizing Halle Berry for how she’s reacting to this when she never asked to be part of it in the first place? Berry was in a difficult position, and she found a way to make the most of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrody, meanwhile, won his second Best Actor trophy last night. On his way to the podium, he realized he had gum in his mouth, spit it out, and threw it to his girlfriend—the Times captured a Renaissance painting–like action shot of it. It was its own kind of cringe, and that was before Brody shushed the play-off orchestra to continue a meandering speech that even The Brutalist’s greatest fans can agree was going on too long. It wouldn’t be an Adrien Brody Oscar acceptance speech if he didn’t do at least one annoying thing.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nOn Valentine’s Day, I read the note my husband of three years wrote me for me alongside with the usual box of cherry cordials (my favorite). For context, alongside my day job, I am an artist. I create art in a number of media including short story writing, poetry, oil on canvas, watercolors, graphite, and charcoal. I also dabble in digital art. My husband has a peripheral awareness of the art world, but his hobbies tend to lean toward traditionally masculine ones (sports, video games, podcasting). I think our different passions suit us really well. I learn new things from him and his expertise as he does from my expertise.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when he gave me my Valentine’s Day card with the most beautiful, heartfelt love letter that I have ever read. He struck every chord, putting into words things about myself I thought I held closer to my chest, and he did it succinctly and expertly. He made me feel seen, adored, worshipped, and whole by this letter. Now I am dealing with feelings of envy and inadequacy. An art form I have been studying, researching, practicing, applying, editing, failing at, and (rarely) succeeding in since high school, and it turns out my meathead husband has had a natural talent for it this WHOLE TIME! I asked him when he wrote this, and he told me during a meeting the day before. He said he tried to make me an origami animal, got frustrated, and channeled those feelings of love for me and this is what came out. One strategy. One draft. One attempt. I could scream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am ashamed to say that when he was out walking the dog, I searched his browsing history for AI. I was devastated (but not wholly surprised) when I couldn’t find anything. He knows how I feel about AI’s place in art (it doesn’t have one). I looked through the trash by his desk to see if he was at least lying about his number of attempts, and I found week-old receipts and notes, but nothing about how my eyes are the tether to his moral compass. I don’t know what to do. I feel hopeless. I want to give up. I have been producing art for consumption for decades and none of it has come close to his letter. I want to cherish it, rip it up, set it on fire, and turn the ashes into a piece, but that would not undo the knowledge I have that my husband is a natural talent. And it would probably hurt his feelings. He seemed very proud of it. How do I move past this? The awareness of my mediocrity is not exactly a source of inspiration or insight at the moment.\n\n—Mediocre in Manhattan\n\nDear Mediocre,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you need to be honest with your husband, but not too honest: Tell him that while you love the intention of his letter (and the fact that he chose to express his feelings for you in such an objectively romantic way), you’re also feeling some weird, complicated emotions about his newly discovered writing talent. I would add something like, “I love you, but this letter provoked a side of me that I don’t like very much. I am going to work on it, but I just want you to know that if I am acting a little weird for a while, it doesn’t have to do with you or how much I love you. This is just me being insecure for a bit, OK?” Reaffirm your love for him and your appreciation for his gesture, and then take the actual knot of rage/envy/disbelief to therapy, if possible, or a trusted friend who has some experience with artistic jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat you need is to first vent, and then to let yourself find out just how surprisingly motivating a little creative envy can be. Throw yourself into your craft—whatever the medium—and work your demons out on your own time, away from your marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also highly recommend getting into a few biographies or articles of artists you admire (especially if they’re also married to other artists); I think you’ll find comfort in the agonies experienced by artists like Lee Krasner, Elaine de Kooning, or even the author Emily Gould, whose partners’ talent often overshadowed their own. It’s a pretty universal experience, and the trick for you to handle it productively, I think, comes down to channeling your energy into the right outlets.\n\nGet advice from Prudie—submit a question!

I find myself obsessing over each update throughout the day, essentially kneecapping myself from doing what I feel I need to do to be successful in my program. It feels like no one at my school is talking about what’s happening. I’m afraid for my future patients, my loved ones, and (selfishly) for myself. I see a future of suffering and overworking in the face of a party and an ever-growing contingent of people who think that science is based on falsehoods and that doctors are trying to trick them for profit. I know that any future we have needs good people who are focused on doing good things, but I truly cannot stop ruminating while feeling so horribly powerless to stop the tide. What am I supposed to do?\n\n—Scared Sick\n\nDear Scared Sick,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou need to find some like-minded medical students—and a mentor or two—with whom you can externalize your anxieties with (AKA, talk to). It’s miserable to worry about anything on your own, and the issues facing our country are not the kind that one person can fix, either. Take your endless rumination as a sign that you’re ready to be helpful. If you’re not able to find people in your exact field to commiserate with, I’d look into joining a mutual aid group, volunteer cause, or extracurricular activity that can put you in touch with fellow concerned citizens who could absolutely put your energy and expertise to good use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nThe columnists behind our advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI have an older paternal half-sister, “Chloe.” We always knew the other existed and had limited encounters as children, but due to distance, family dynamics, and overall lifestyles, we were pretty much estranged. (I would honestly forget at times that I even had a sister.) Last year, I wanted to change that though and reached out to her. We connected and began talking through phone calls, texts, emails, and social media. I even went out to meet with her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, all these instances revealed to me that Chloe is not someone I want in my life. She’s self-centered, rude, opinionated, judgmental, inconsiderate, and just a terrible individual. Our relationship consists of me doing all the heavy lifting, and she never shows gratitude toward me even when I go out of my way to help her. I no longer want a relationship and have already taken steps to cut all contact by changing my number, my email addresses, and blocking her on social media. However, my mom has been giving me grief for this. To be clear, she doesn’t care about us not having a relationship; she actually warned me that reaching out might not go the way I hoped. Her issue is how I’m going about ending things. She feels I owe it to Chloe to have one more conversation where I explain why I don’t want her in my life so that there’s closure. I disagree. We’re both grown women and I doubt Chloe would even notice my absence until years from now, if she does at all. But my mom feels that since I was the one to initiate contact, the least I could do is officially end it even if it means getting cursed out. Who is right here?\n\n—No Sisterly Bond After All\n\nDear Sisterly Bond,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do generally think it’s lousy to disappear on someone if they haven’t actually harmed you or knowingly done something to deserve it. It sounds like Chloe is not a great person, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t deserve a little decency in the form of some acknowledgement. The good news is that you don’t really have to say much: You can just write her a text or an email that states some version of, “I’m glad we had the chance to get to know each other over the past few years, but it seems like we’re pretty different people. I think I’m going to focus on my stuff for now, but I wish you the best.”\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nWhen they raised me in the 1970s, my parents firmly believed in the old adage “spare the rod, spoil the child.” My father had a strap hanging off the bathroom door, which he used at least once a week. My mother joined. When I grew up and left home, I moved on and had a fairly normally relationship with them both. Now, however, as they are getting older and far more dependent on my support, I feel this incredible anger and resentment. I’ve heard the excuses—it was a different time—but I remember being angry and unsafe, scared, and hurt, and the rage inside me boils up. At times, I feel incapable of being around them and often have to walk away because I feel this overwhelming instinct to lash out. It’s becoming increasingly hard to brush over these incidents. Do I cut ties? They depend on my help but I feel so resentful.\n\n—Hide the Knives\n\nDear Hide the Knives,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that your parents are starting to depend on you, it makes sense that a lot of these buried emotions are rising to the surface. I think you can express some of your anger as a measured disappointment to your parents (“You know, I was really scared of you as a kid”), but you do have to be prepared for the possibility where they’re mad you “haven’t gotten over it,” or are upset that you’d even bring it up. They might not even remember the abuse in the same way and may try to refute your own memories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat’s all to say that I think there’s a very small limit to what you can expect in terms of closure offered directly from your parents, especially as they get older. It would be a more productive use of your time to seek a good therapist or support group where you can dive into all the complex emotions you have about your childhood and exorcise/process all of the hurt you’ve suffered. Ideally, once you have a solid outlet, you will be better able to navigate your existing relationship with your parents without feeling so overcome by emotion. At that point, you can then decide what you want your relationship with them to look like—whether that involves limited contact or something else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, you can tell your parents that you’re vaguely having “a hard time,” and that you don’t want to overwhelm them with your problems. You can say something like, “I’m taking a few months to work on some anger and hurt that I have been feeling, and it means that I might seem cold or distant to you, but I am still going to keep taking care of you, of course.” If it feels right, keep your distance. If you continue to see them and catch yourself at a boiling point with them, take yourself out of the equation and go for a walk or a coffee until you can return to a baseline of calm again. It’s the greatest irony in the world that we’re usually not able to get the apologies we need from our parents, but remind yourself that you have a full, grown-up life now and a great support network who can take care of you better than they ever did.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’ve been friends with a couple of people who each individually need an exhausting amount of affirmation. Not only that, but they’re not asking for it like a close friend would (where I’d provide it unquestionably), but in the form of click-bait group texts: “Guess what I did last Friday? You won’t believe who I met.” In my three closest relationships, these kinds of affirmations are given and received, but when faced with casual acquaintances that pull me in deeper, all I want to say is, “Get some friends to talk about it.” How can I say that in a polite but firm way?\n\n—Reluctant Participant\n\nDear Reluctant,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s no law that says you have to reply to any of those texts at all. Let them go unanswered, and then follow up a few days (or weeks) later and explain vaguely that, oops, sorry, you’ve been bad about checking your phone. After a few of these instances, your friends will learn to seek instant gratification elsewhere.\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI was adopted, and most of my biological family was gone when I started looking.

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "And the Oscar for Laziest Take goes to … everyone who compared this year’s most unexpected outcome to The Substance.\n\nYes, after one of the most topsy-turvy awards seasons in recent memory, we finally received some closure on Sunday night in a bunch of hotly contested categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress: It was an Anora sweep. Like its title character, Sean Baker’s comedy about a sex worker squaring off against her new Russian husband’s family/goons evidently proved too charming for academy voters to resist. And despite the momentum Anora had gained in recent weeks, the results still felt like an upset for the little independent movie that could.\n\nAnora’s biggest surprise triumph, though, was 25-year-old Mikey Madison collecting the Best Actress prize. Most pundits had predicted the Oscar would go to Demi Moore, 62, for her (quite literally) monstrous work in The Substance, the body-horror movie wherein she played a star taking a mysterious drug that spawns a younger version of herself called Sue (Margaret Qualley) with whom she soon battles. Moore’s chances ballooned after a moving Golden Globes acceptance speech in January in which she reflected on how touched she felt to finally be recognized by an industry that had frequently discounted her as a “popcorn actress.” In addition to locking down her Academy Award nomination, that speech also gave Moore a narrative as she campaigned for Oscars glory: She was the comeback queen, an aging star whose monumental career could no longer be ignored thanks, finally, to a meaty role worthy of her talents.\n\nAnd yet, not all endings are Hollywood endings. As Madison collected the statue, she paid tribute to “the thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful, breathtaking work” of her fellow Best Actress nominees. The camera then cut to Moore, putting her hands to her chest, looking genuinely moved but also happy for Madison. It seemed as if peace could finally be restored to gay men’s group chats across the world. But then came the takes …\n\n“And the Oscar goes to … Sue,” declared Vulture. The New York Times reported that Moore had suffered a “snub,” leaving her fans bemoaning a defeat that “underscored one of the central themes of the film: the challenges older actresses face in a Hollywood that is obsessed with young women.” ESPN’s Paolo Uggetti wrote in one tweet, viewed by millions and favorited by hundreds of thousands, that Moore’s loss was “basically the plot of The Substance,” while Jeopardy host Ken Jennings wrote in another viral post on Bluesky that the result “should be a post-credits scene” to Moore’s film. In the Washington Post, Ty Burr opined that “Qualley should have accepted the statue while Moore sprayed the Dolby Theatre in a massive explosion of blood and viscera, just like in her movie.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can’t believe I have to say this, but here goes: Mikey Madison did not win the Best Actress Oscar because she was a younger, hotter version of Demi Moore. Not only does the mere suggestion completely erase Madison’s nuanced and moving work in Anora, but it also fundamentally misunderstands The Substance—and the Oscars themselves.\n\nFirst, while it’s tempting to see the academy as still being overly obsessed with rewarding ingénues, that’s just not the case anymore. Over the past decade, in a concerted effort to diversify what had been a voting body composed overwhelmingly of old white men, huge swaths of female, minority, and younger industry workers have been invited to become members. In 2021, women even outnumbered men in the academy’s board of governors for the first time, and they still do. And while the pace of change has been too slow (the New York Times reported last year that still only 34 percent of academy members were women), the average age of Best Actress winners has risen as diversity has increased. Before Sunday night, only two women who were under 35 (Emma Stone and Brie Larson) had won the Oscar in the past 10 years. Heck, Frances McDormand has won twice while in her 60s. And while the age gap between male and female winners used to be as big as 12 years, according to a Sky News analysis last year, the average age for both is now the same: 50. The fact that both Moore and 59-year-old Fernanda Torres of I’m Still Here had been front-runners spoke volumes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if ageism isn’t what it used to be, misogyny still may be—but not in the way you might be inclined to think. Instead of playing a part in Moore’s loss, it’s rearing its head in the reaction to Madison’s victory. To reduce her win to the grounds of youth and beauty is fundamentally sexist and belies the hard and complex work Madison did honing her craft and bringing her character to life. Anora, or Ani as she prefers to be called, was ferocious yet vulnerable—at once, comic and tragic—and Madison secured the trophy because of how well she carried this balance, in two languages and with a pitch-perfect Brooklyn accent. The scene in the car at the end where she finally breaks down with Igor (Yura Borisov) is what won her the Oscar, not any exotic dancing she performed. If Moore has lamented that she was “extremely shamed” for her work in Striptease, the way to correct for this isn’t to shame another woman nearly three decades later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate The Part of Anora’s Oscars Triumph That’s Truly Revolutionary Read More\n\nMoreover, to suggest that Moore somehow lost because of a beauty pageant also requires me to believe that she did not look like a total freaking smokeshow last night or all awards season. I’m sorry, but I have eyes! Did you see the dress she was wearing last night?! The woman is a supermodel. As my colleague Rebecca Onion wrote in Slate, “More damning than any Hollywood satire in The Substance is the fact that Moore is considered brave for playing 12 years younger than she actually is.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoore did phenomenal work with what she was given (which was basically that one devastating scene where she lost all self-confidence while preparing for a date). But the truth is that Madison just had much more to do in a much larger role. Unlike Moore, she also didn’t spend most of her movie buried underneath prosthetics. It was, quite simply, a better performance and one that was ultimately powerful enough to best any campaign narrative Moore had going for her.\n\nThe Substance explored the constrictive prisons into which a male-dominated society forces women. It looked at how women are taught to hate themselves and fight one another. To weaponize its feminist message to undercut another woman feels ignorant at best and ignoble at worst. It’s an insult to Madison, an insult to the academy members who voted for her (not all of whom look like Dennis Quaid’s prawn-mangling executive), and an insult to The Substance.\n\nRead more in Slate about the Oscars.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here. (It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nAround the time I got engaged, my aunt started making some very destructive (and very public) decisions. My mom and her other siblings reached out in various ways to help her and she was mostly very nasty to them, often resorting to personal attacks when they’d try to get her to face her actions and help her through the consequences. When it came time to send out wedding and bridal shower invites I decided, based on her past and current actions and her uncontrolled drinking, not to invite my aunt. I asked my mother her feelings on it and shared my reasoning and she agreed and said her sister had been very hurtful to many people and it would probably be a relief to them to not have her there.\n\nIt’s now been two years since that, and my mother has mostly improved the relationship with my aunt. My aunt recently shared with my mother that she was very hurt by not being invited to my wedding and shower when all her other siblings were, and said it really didn’t help her at an already very difficult time. She would like an apology from me. My mother shared this with me and said she thought it would be a good idea for me to do it. I don’t think I need to. The fact that she is in a better place now doesn’t change where she was at that time, and I believe either event would’ve become her platform to lash out at more people (with good evidence from some other family functions to support this). I don’t really have any relationship with this aunt; but for the sake of the relationship with my mother, do I need to fake an apology?\n\n— Not Sorry for No invite\n\nDear Not Sorry,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your aunt would like an apology from you, she needs to ask you, not your mom. I doubt she will. And honestly, the fact that she can’t see how destructive she was back then—and that she’s still, in a sense, lashing out at people-—suggests to me that she’s not really in a better place at all. You made the right call back then, and you don’t need to apologize for it now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelp! I Need a Great New Podcast in My Headphones!\n\nThe Dear Prudence podcast is back. Listen every Friday on Slate or your podcast player of choice.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m in a really happy committed relationship; my partner means more than anything to me. However, before we got together, I had met this guy, and we’d clicked like I’d never clicked with anyone ever—we acted like we were in a relationship without ever being in one. Then, when I confirmed my feelings for him, he rejected me and it got weird between us. After that, I still loved him, but I wasn’t quite in love with him; we became like two friends with sexual/romantic tension. Then overnight, he changed and began to treat me badly and used my caring for him against me. At that point, I met the guy I’m with now. The first guy and I continued to click, but I eventually cut him off after a huge fight. However, we started talking again at work, and he’s like a drink that goes down too easily. I don’t love him romantically anymore, but it’s fun being with him. My boyfriend hates how he treats me, all my friends hate him, and on some level, I hate him. We’re bad for each other but work like magnets.\n\nHow can I let go?\n\n— A Hopeless Magnet\n\nDear Hopeless Magnet,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the surface, the answer here is easy: Stop talking to your toxic friend-with-almost-benefits (and many detriments) and focus on your boyfriend and your friends. But I know you won’t do it! You can’t get enough of this guy. “A drink that goes down too easily” is actually the perfect description. I think you’re drawn to him and how terrible and emotionally hungover he makes you feel because, like alcohol, he does something to suppress or distract from unpleasant feelings or make life seem (temporarily) more fun. Being drawn to someone who excites you but hurts you and treats you poorly—someone who you admit you hate!—is not a thing that happens if you like yourself and feel good about the other parts of your life. But if you’re vulnerable in some way, and I think you are, a person like this and all the drama and pain that come with them can be addictive.\n\nSo, I think the way forward is to slowly become a person who feels better about themselves. Who is turned off rather than on by being treated poorly. Who doesn’t need tension and drama to feel alive. That is a very tall order, and it involves all the familiar, annoyingly predictable pain-in-the-ass-to-implement advice! Take good care of yourself, mentally and physically. Go to therapy or journal to reflect on your feelings and try to identify some patterns and possibly have a breakthrough. Imagine how you’d like your life to look and how you’d like to feel in the future, and give some honest thought to how this guy is stopping you from getting there. Do things you seriously love, and chase the feelings they give you rather than the feelings of being in a twisted situationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, just to get things moving: You say your friends hate this guy. Great. Ask them for an intervention: An hour or two where you all hang out, over some food and drinks, and they tell you all the reasons this has to end, and you can’t get mad. If you aren’t in a position want better than a super toxic relationship for yourself, maybe you can get there by hearing about what people who care about you think you deserve.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy former spouse recently came out to me via text message that they are trans and have begun the process of transitioning.\n\nNormally, I’m extremely happy for anyone living their truth and have many trans friends. I’m a member of the queer community myself, and I frequently go to Pride and have sat on boards for LGBTQ+ groups.\n\nWhen it comes to my ex though, I’m finding it impossible to feel anything but sick. Aside from my spouse and one friend, no one knows about the emotional, mental, (light) physical, and sexual abuse my ex put me through in the years we were married. I was ashamed and pretended everything was fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, my friends in the community want me to praise my ex and invite them to events. The thought of doing so makes me have a panic attack. But when I demure, my friends act like I’m not really a trans ally. Is there something I can say to them to make them understand I’m still an ally, just not for my ex?\n\n— Can’t Be Happy for Them\n\nDear Can’t Be Happy,\n\nI know this feels awful, but I don’t think the logistics with your friends need to be all that complicated (assuming they really respect your needs and boundaries): “I know you may not have realized this, but ‘ex’ and I are not actually on good terms after our split for reasons I’d rather not get into, and I try to avoid contact where I can. But of course it’s wonderful that they’re finding their path and I hope they get all the support they need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy mother had me extremely young and wasn’t around much in my childhood. She left me with my great-grandmother, who loved me very much but was in no condition to raise a child. My mother did put herself through nursing school and met and married a very nice man when I was 14. I went to live with them then. I am proud of her accomplishments, but something new has happened that I don’t know how to feel about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother and her husband are undergoing IVF and trying for a baby. They are both very excited and talk about what a great big sister I will be (I am a school teacher). This all weirds me out. My mother always said she never wanted another child and her husband tolerated me the best he could (he wasn’t cruel or cold, but had no idea what to do with a teenager). I would have said I had made peace with the past and had a good relationship with them both, but all their enthusiasm feels like an emotional bruise. I don’t want to rain on their parade, but last time, I had to leave the table and go into the bathroom to cry. How do I deal with this? In my head, I accept everyone did the best they could with what they had on hand. In my heart, it is a different story.\n\n— Unexpected Emotions\n\nDear Unexpected Emotions,\n\nAccepting that everyone did the best they could is a great start, even if you only believe this with your head and not your heart. But also, when it comes to being generous with your understanding and empathy, which I hear for your mom and your great-grandma and your stepfather, I hope you haven’t forgotten about yourself! Before you try to get excited for your mom and her possible new baby, how about taking some time to really feel sorry for yourself? I’m serious. You basically grew up without your mom, and you were raised by someone who wasn’t equipped to truly parent you. That was hard and it hurt! Just because you weren’t abused or neglected doesn’t mean you didn’t live through something incredibly difficult. When you began living with your mother (and a stranger who had no idea how to relate to you), that was hard too!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, suddenly, they are going to have a re-do. It’s painful because the life this new baby is going to get is the one you were denied, but totally deserved. Don’t try to suppress the feeling that that’s unfair. It totally is!\n\nTake the pressure off yourself. You don’t have to get excited about this development. Not yet and possibly, not ever. You can be happy that your mom, who you love, is in a better place now in her life. And your only job with respect to the new baby is to buy something off the registry and wait and see if you love him or her when you two meet. I think you might be surprised that you have warmer feelings than the ones you expect—not because you have to or because you forced yourself or because it makes sense, but just because you do.\n\nCatch up on this week’s Prudie.\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI feel totally at ease around my boyfriend, especially when we are cuddling. Being in his arms is pure contentment. His presence clears my mind of all fears and worries and allows me to detach from the stresses of the world. And this is where the problem comes in: I get so relaxed around him that I get sleepy! To some extent, he thinks it’s cute, but I know he is bothered by the differences in our energy levels. It’s very hard on him when he wants to play and I’m drifting in and out of consciousness…",

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nLast week, the FBI Agents Association issued a memo assuring its members that FBI Director Kash Patel had privately acknowledged that the next deputy director of the bureau should be a career agent, someone with deep experience at the FBI. Dan Bongino’s appointment to the position of second in command to Patel was announced an hour later, meaning the new No. 1 and No. 2 positions at the FBI have never served as FBI agents. Bongino is a former Secret Service agent and longtime podcaster with extreme conspiracy-fueled position on the events of Jan. 6, the classified documents case against Donald Trump, and the FBI itself.\n\nBongino’s appointment is evidence of a chilling reversal at the highest echelons of law enforcement in the United States. Lacking the relevant experience to lead the bureau, the people charged with protecting and enforcing the law are being chosen for their stated desire to carry out unlawful acts and a willingness to use the powers of law enforcement to break the law. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent who is now assistant dean and a senior lecturer at Yale University’s Jackson School of Global Affairs; she also has a regular newsletter, the Freedom Academy. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Even in this maelstrom of law enforcement horrors, this appointment raises real red flags for me, maybe because of some of the things Bongino has said on his podcast, like that the bureau is “lost and broken” and “irredeemably corrupt.” Or because of what he said on Fox News after the FBI searched for and found classified documents at Mar-a-Lago: “Every person involved in this has to be fired immediately,” and, “there is no fixing this, only rebuilding it.” Can you help us pick through what is mere trolling to see what this all really means? The plan here is to impose “radical reform” at the FBI, and I’m not sure we have begun to understand what that really looks like.\n\nAsha Rangappa: So, the deputy director is typically a career agent. The FBI Agents Association letter that went out said [it would be] somebody with at least 17 years of bureau experience, because this is someone who can effectively step into the shoes of the director if they need to. This person needs to have a bird’s eye understanding of the bureau, which does a lot of different things. It does criminal investigations, it does counterterrorism, it does counterintelligence, it has an intelligence function within the intelligence community. The deputy director would usually be someone who has enough experience to understand all these things, and who has developed relationships as they have come up through the ranks. In order to reach senior rank in the FBI you usually have to do tours through FBI headquarters, and go out to different field offices. Typically a deputy director would have extensive networks and contacts, in addition to all the different supervisory experience and management experience that they’ve had. To have someone come in who has none of that is itself crazy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next thing to consider is temperament. Any career agent, and typically any director until now who has worked at senior levels of the Justice Department, will have at some point been through a background check in order to get the appropriate clearances. The criteria that the FBI is checking for in these background checks—the rubric they use to determine whether somebody is suitable for a position of public trust—is the Adjudicative Desk Reference. It lists three things that correlate with trustworthiness, reliability, and not presenting a security risk. No. 1 is a strong sense of social responsibility. No. 2 is self-control, or the ability to exercise responsible and rational control over one’s impulses. And No. 3 is the ability to maintain personal or job commitments over time. I’m not sure this new leadership at the FBI is really meeting those criteria. We’re not seeing people who have a lot of self-control or who offer calm, deliberate, and dispassionate evaluation of things.\n\nPerhaps also salient under this rubric of temperament and self-control is how extreme some of Bongino’s statements have been. His claims about what happened are not surprising—Kash Patel is a Jan. 6 denialist, so of course his deputy would be too—but Bongino has asserted that pipe bombs found near the Capitol on Jan. 6 were an inside job, and that the FBI knew who it was. He has said he wants to shut down the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance) Court. He’s talked about firing every single FBI agent involved in the search of Donald Trump’s home in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess what’s interesting to me is that while all that I just mentioned flies in the face of core FBI values, he now defends himself from these past statements by saying, we all play a role … I was just playing the lunatic podcaster. It seems to me this is another version of the Proud Boy/Oath Keeper play, when they say all this lawless stuff, and they do all this lawless stuff, and then say, “Oh, I was just kidding!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’ve seen this ploy before with Trump. My colleague and friend, Jennifer Meka, who’s a scholar of rhetoric, explained this rhetorical trick she says demagogues use, and I think the people in Trump’s orbit have learned it. It’s called paralipsis. Paralipsis is this move of, “I’m saying, but I’m not really saying.” So the speaker may say something and then create a certain plausible deniability around it, so they can claim they weren’t really saying it.\n\nKash Patel is not really deploying this very well, because he did actually say the thing, but he’s now after the fact saying that he’s joking. Trump is much better at this, of talking out of both sides of his mouth. It is a way of avoiding accountability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, interestingly, the first letter that went out to all FBI agents after Patel was confirmed sounded shockingly normal. It sounded like the kind of letter a director would send out to agents, essentially saying, I value the work that you do, you all are the warriors that defend the rule of law, I have your backs.\n\nFor a moment there I thought maybe we’re turning a corner. Maybe Patel is understanding the weightiness of this mantle. But then I understand that on his first day he ordered a thousand agents to be transferred to other field offices and 500 nonagents to be transferred to Huntsville, Alabama. That’s not a thoughtful, deliberate kind of decision when you look at what headquarters does and what that kind of hollowing out would do to our law enforcement capability. So I really don’t know where this is going.\n\nRelated From Slate That Oval Office Shouting Match Was a Setup Read More\n\nWas the purpose of sending all those agents way far afield just to get them to quit?\n\nThat was my first thought, because these are people who have families in the D.C. area, maybe they have spouses who are working, they have kids in school. And to suddenly be ordered to report to Boise, Idaho, or whatever, is a huge disruption. I can imagine that an effect will be that a large number of those people quit or retire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is also a part of Patel’s philosophy: He believes that agents should not be at headquarters. He’s had this disdain for FBI headquarters for a while, and he’s talked about turning it into a museum, so I don’t know that it’s completely surprising that he wanted everybody out of there.\n\nI think I want to end with a big question, which is what happens when the defenders of law become the enemies of the law? Are we there yet? What will the markers be that we’ve fully lost our way in terms of who is enforcing the law? And I would love to know what we can do about it.\n\nWe need to move away from thinking that “Is this legal? Or are we in a constitutional crisis?” are the only important questions right now. These are bad frames to use right now because there is a huge runway of things that are legal but are still really, really bad. Pardoning all the Jan. 6 defendants was bad and if Kash Patel wants to hire them all as FBI agents—these things are legal, they’re constitutional.\n\nI’m definitely not an expert on countering authoritarian regimes. I defer to our friends and colleagues like Ruth Ben-Ghiat on these matters, but one of the things that does seem to be a good strategy is coalition building across differences. That is what they did in Chile to remove a dictator. And I always think of the Chilean example because I think, If these people could get rid of that dictator after 17 years, then we can definitely stop this tide. We are still very early, and we still have a lot of power.\n\nI’ll leave you with the last line of the Percy Bysshe Shelley poem, “The Mask of Anarchy”: “Ye are many — they are few.”",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Marriage is hardly a new invention. But leaving your husband is, relatively speaking. There’s one political party in particular that isn’t so happy with that development.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance called no-fault divorce “one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace.” Donald Trump, famously a two-time ex-husband himself, remained mostly quiet on the subject, but for a lot of American women, it felt as if divorce were on the ballot that year. Divorced men, in particular, thought they had a renewed champion: In July 2024, a poll suggested that those men, far more than divorced women or even married men, would be voting for Trump. “Divorced Men Are Falling For Trump,” the Cut proclaimed by October. Meanwhile, on social media, women married to registered Republican men talked about their plans to cancel out their husbands’ votes. “I feel like he is voting against mine and our daughters (F7) best interest and her future,” one woman wrote on Reddit last summer.\n\nFor a few glimmering moments in 2024, it seemed as if white women—Trump’s second-biggest voting bloc, who are often married to white men, his first-biggest voting bloc—were going to learn their lesson from 2016. They organized Zoom calls and raised millions upon millions for Kamala Harris’ campaign. But many seemed primed to use their personal lives as the ultimate political leverage: Moderate and Democratic women were considering divorcing their Trumpian husbands. Last year, divorce was being discussed as a means of resistance. Whispers on- and offline suggested that women across the country were finally fed up with their Trump-voting husbands, that a second Trump term would mean their marriages were beyond repair.\n\nBut leaving is easier said than done, and it all seemed to hinge on what would happen in November. If Trump lost, would their marriages survive a woman in the White House for once? And if he won, could these women stay with the men who helped put him back in office?\n\nIn three parts of the country—Colorado, Pennsylvania, and California—three straight, working, married white women with Trump-backing husbands told me about how politics had infested their marriages. They had met and married their husbands long before Trump became a problem for them to manage personally. They all had children with these men. They moved cities and bought homes. Meanwhile, they all became the primary breadwinners in their family units.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, they spent three election cycles trying to persuade their husbands not to vote for a man who threatened their bodily autonomy, their children’s futures, and the very (tattered) fabric of American democracy. From the depths of the election cycle in October all the way to Election Day and beyond, these women weighed their options: stay, or go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the Election\n\nIn October, 54-year-old Beth was a few weeks away from celebrating two decades married to her husband—that is, if they’d be able to make it to their anniversary in November.\n\nWhen they met, as is true for a lot of now-unhappy couples, their relationship felt breezy. “I was already accustomed to dating men like that, the redneck vanilla guys. He was typical of the pool of eligibles that I fished in as a Midwestern gal,” she said about meeting him in the early aughts at a college alumni event. The two of them eventually wed and settled down in Colorado. “People are inclined to say, ‘You knew what you were getting.’ You don’t. I didn’t realize what I was getting into.” She’s had a divorce attorney on the line since 2016, though it hasn’t gone beyond a few preliminary phone calls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeth had already muscled through a few rough years by election time. (Beth is not her real name; all women in this story were granted pseudonyms to protect them from reprisals, and some small identifying details have been adjusted to ensure anonymity.) In July 2020, mid–COVID lockdown, she was diagnosed with advanced-stage bowel cancer. She went through treatment and has been cancer-free since 2021, but it weakened her body and her spirit and added extra strain on her marriage, which was already starting to turn. She called me from her office, where she works as a lawyer, to avoid her husband’s overhearing her malcontent. “The damage done from the treatment and the surgery is permanent,” she said.\n\nAmong its brutal impacts is that the chemotherapy has weakened her immune system. That made her husband’s refusal to get any of the several COVID-19 shots available to him all the more galling. “He became radicalized during the pandemic,” she said. “When I mentioned to a few people that he didn’t get it, people were really offended. Like, You’re getting treatment for cancer, and he won’t get vaccinated?” Over time, she got pretty offended too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen their daughter turned 18, around the time vaccines became widely available in Colorado, the fight infected the rest of the family. Her husband didn’t want any of the kids to get a vaccination, but their daughter insisted on it. “I couldn’t have been prouder, the way she handled my husband,” Beth said in October, back when polling data still had Harris up by a point or two. “She really did a big fuck you. She wasn’t taking any shit from him.”\n\nIt’s been through her relationship with her daughter that Beth has started to see the value of filing for divorce after all this time. “She texted me that she would rather be dead than deal with another Trump presidency,” Beth said. “I thought, Wow, this is it.” She felt she needed to leave him, “if for no other reason than to stand up for my daughter, showing her that at some point, it comes down to your principles.”\n\nHer husband had every intention of voting for Trump again, no matter how many arguments he got into about it with his daughter, or his son, or his wife.\n\nFor 30-year-old Annie, a veterinarian from the U.K. who had a baby earlier in the year with her 37-year-old husband, their conflicts were less about his politics and more about how much disregard he had for half the country. Not the half that votes for Democrats, but rather: women. Her husband’s views were often pretty liberal; the two of them agreed that the U.S. needed to stop giving Israel arms to bomb Palestinians—they were both hoping for an immediate ceasefire—and he also believed in accessible health care for all. But they kept having arguments about gender, and he just couldn’t get his head around voting for a woman. “I’m not sure I really picked up on the misogyny when we first met,” she said. “He wouldn’t think of himself as someone who doesn’t like women or thinks women are less than.” But Annie is an immigrant, living stateside in California as an immigrant, with paperwork tied to her husband. To leave him is to also leave the country, where her baby is a citizen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Annie tried to make sense of her husband’s distaste for marginalized groups in power, she came back to his first union. Her husband was married once before, and Annie said he’s still angry at how his ex treated him during their marriage. “That’s probably some of the root cause; he almost expects women to hurt him in some way,” she said. Still, by October, she and her husband were quarreling over his criticisms of Harris’ gender and race. “He feels that elevating the rights of others, specifically people of color, erodes his rights,” she said. “That’s been a discussion around Harris as well, that maybe they picked her because she’s Black and she’s a woman.” Annie’s husband had long been more of a third-party voter; in 2024 he was decidedly on the fence about how to vote, toggling between Trump and a third-party candidate (though she couldn’t entirely remember which one).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnnie was also battling against her husband’s online habits, which consisted mostly of playing video games and watching others game on platforms like Twitch. “I think sometimes those people are a little misogynistic in the way they view the world, so he gets his talking points from that, rather than data-driven sources,” she said. That was bad enough for Annie to tolerate, but they also have an infant son, who isn’t yet paying attention to Dad’s words but will clue in soon enough. “I want my son to grow up to know he takes 50 percent of responsibility of everything in the home, in the relationship,” she said. “I won’t tolerate any kind of misogynistic viewpoints from him at all.” (Annie said that, despite his views, her husband is an equal parent in the home and is perfectly comfortable with her being the primary breadwinner.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Beth sounded defeated by the state of her marriage, and if Annie was anxiously trying to reform her husband, then 52-year-old Heather was filled with the kind of rage that only divorced women understand.\n\n“On our second date, he was telling me he never paid attention to the news. He didn’t know much,” she said in October. “I asked him, ‘OK, who’s the vice president?’ He didn’t know! I kind of found it endearing and cute at the time, but it’s something that, after the last eight years, has stuck in my mind. He’s someone who just doesn’t know things.” But still, she wasn’t prepared for how bad his politics would get. After all, he voted for Barack Obama in 2012, and they even attended the White House Christmas party together that year. “It was the first time he ever voted,” Heather said. “He got really into it with me.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOriginally from New York—which you can still very much hear in her staccato accent—but now living in Pennsylvania, freelance writer Heather has been married to her husband for 24 years. They have two kids, and she tolerated his uninhibited support for Trump through his first administration, even after one of their children came out as nonbinary and started fighting with their dad about politics. But this time around, things have been harder, particularly with how trans people have been targeted by the Trump campaign, and how much that weighs on their nonbinary child. “They were like, ‘I’m going to show him Project 2025. I’m going to convince him out of it,’ ” Heather said. “I thought I could appeal to his decency, to who he was before. But I can’t look at a person who’s OK with vile racism and vile misogyny and sexual assault and disgusting xenophobia.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than any of the other husbands, Heather’s is the furthest through the looking glass when it comes to YouTube conspiracy theories. “He became a 9/11 truther in 2006. He’d say, ‘I just ordered this video off eBay—you gotta watch it with me.’ It was about how the Bush administration did it, they were the ones who crashed the planes in the tower. Really stupid shit,” she said. “I wrote it off.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then came his conspiracies around Sandy Hook: He claimed that the 20 children murdered in that 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school weren’t real. “I found out about Sandy Hook while I was in my son’s class, doing gingerbread houses,” Heather said. “Every mother in there was devastated because this news came across on our phones. And this man is telling me it’s not real?”\n\nEven more gallingly, Heather, who used to be a reporter, was stuck trying to convince her husband that the entirety of the news media isn’t corrupt, evil, and out to manipulate the American public. She spent days trying to explain to him how news stories are put together, what kinds of photos they use, and why murdered 6-year-old children might not leave behind a treasure trove of online data for amateur sleuths to find. “He thinks he understands how the media works,” Heather said. “He said they’re crisis actors.”\n\nFor all three women, the prospect of four more years of Trump seemed devastating—an impossible task for their already-frayed relationships. That their husbands were determined to vote for Trump again was a betrayal not just of their politics but of their families: They were all raising children under an ethos dichotomous to Trump’s. Their hopes were deep with Harris: If she won, then maybe Trump would be defeated for good, and perhaps their marriages would have an opportunity to heal. “Can I drop this?” Beth asked herself. “Can I drop this and keep going if Harris wins?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElection Day\n\nBefore we knew what the election’s results would be, all three of the women I was speaking with were toying with the possibility of filing for divorce.\n\nAnnie was steeling herself for bad election results, but also for talking to her husband about possibly leaving the U.S. for good. “I’d be more comfortable and safer in the U.K. than here,” she said. “I would be stupid to stay here and put my own health at risk.” Their fighting was starting to ramp down at home, even if she knew they were still negotiating huge disagreements. Trump was forcing couples to have arguments over the kinds of things marriage counselors across the world could have never predicted. “We had an argument about tariffs recently,” Annie said. “He didn’t really want to listen to my explanation of why it wouldn’t work.”\n\nMeanwhile, as Harris and Biden failed to secure anything close to a ceasefire in Gaza, Annie and her husband were both reaching unknown levels of disillusionment. “I’m not hugely optimistic,” she said.\n\nHeather wasn’t going to wait around to find out what would happen to no-fault divorce. When I spoke with her right before Election Day, she had already started the divorce process and had plans to put the house on the market for an immediate sale. “I have filed. It’s gotten so clear to me why I don’t want to be married to this person anymore,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stress of her marriage was exacerbated by her own media diet too: While her husband was busy watching YouTube videos about the secret group of elite liberals running the government, Heather was succumbing to her own internet echo chamber. A longtime tweeter, she saw her mentions steadily being overrun by MAGA folks, and she seemed to constantly be going viral in the wrong circles. One especially critical tweet of hers was picked up by one of the YouTubers her husband watches so religiously. He saw the coverage of her public upset and confronted her about it. “I was sitting there all sheepish,” she said. “But you vote for the guy who insults people left and right? And he’s mad I told some bot on Twitter ‘Fuck you’? That’s an issue?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese wounds for Heather go back to 2016, and to the night Trump was elected the first time, thanks to voters like her husband. It was a shock to both of them. “As soon as we realized what’s happening, his jaw dropped and his face went white. I said to him, ‘What did you do?’ ” she said. “The next morning, the kids wake up, they hear the news. They’re crying. He’s trying to calm them down: You trust Daddy, right? Daddy voted for Trump. And that was the end of my marriage.”\n\nFor Heather, it was already irrelevant even before the election who would win the presidency. Her marriage was ruptured to the point that no possible Democratic win could heal it. “There’s nothing to talk about. What is there to say? I can’t do it anymore. He’s never respected me, and I realize that. It’s not personal. He just doesn’t respect women,” she said. “I haven’t had a normal, sane, intelligent conversation with him in 10 years.” Heather was moving things around in her at-home office, digging up old paperwork, starting to envision movers taking boxes out and transporting her to her own town house or apartment. She dropped a stack of papers on her desk. “I can’t wait to meet someone I can have an intelligent conversation with.”\n\nAfter the Election\n\nAfter the election, anecdotes about divorce filings started pouring in from all across the country. Everyone seemed to have a friend who had finally broken up with her boyfriend because he voted for Jill Stein. Beth’s, Heather’s, and Annie’s marriages were all up in the air.\n\nThe day after the election, Beth told me, her husband “stayed in bed all day and didn’t leave his room.” She was grieving Harris’ loss with her kids, but it didn’t seem as if her victorious husband was feeling all that celebratory. Their first contact after the election, she said, was him accusing her of taking out her election anger on him by hiding his Denver Nuggets jersey. (She vociferously denied this.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeth had, days after the election, still barely heard from her husband. Still, she wanted to keep the peace in the coming weeks; she and her family had a beach vacation planned, and it was the only thing keeping Beth going. She was happy to dissociate a bit from her troubled marriage; others were not so accommodating. “My younger sister knows what’s happening, and she’s judgy. She wants me to go through with this, but she’s like, I can’t believe you’d want to go on vacation with him,” Beth said. “I need this trip. My kids deserve this trip. I have no illusions that it’ll change anything about how I feel.”\n\nHer displeasure with her marriage had bloomed—it was no longer just about his voting for Trump, but a lifetime of little failures. “I didn’t get anything for my 50th birthday. No party, no dinner. Thanksgiving is our 20th anniversary, which is ostensibly why we scheduled this trip, but I’m not celebrating a goddamn thing,” she said. “What I’m sore about—sad, really—is that I didn’t get anything to celebrate beating cancer. That was never mentioned at all.”\n\nBut she had other things on her plate, aside from the ongoing physical issues following cancer treatment. She was eager for a break at work too, because a discrimination investigation—far from the first she had had to witness ripple through her colleagues—was taking place at her law firm. The morning we spoke, she had to be interviewed by an investigator about just how unhealthy her workplace has become. “I’m pretty angry because this is the second time I’ve had to do this inside of five years,” she said. Beth had been harassed and condescended to at work more times than she could count; her husband doing it at home added insult to injury. “He thinks I’m an idiot. He tells me that pretty much on a weekly basis, what an idiot I am,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeth had finally come up with her own retort: “You know what our new word is for them? Mediocre. I’ve been hearing that a lot lately: mediocre white male.” When I asked her if she meant that her husband was one of “them,” she burst out laughing: “Yes!” It sounded as if she were maybe ready to do something about it. “I can’t take the embarrassment any longer,” Beth said. “This might sound stupid, but I feel like I have to stand up for my daughter. I have to show her that you don’t have to stay in a marriage or any other kind of relationship where someone is emotionally abusive.”\n\nWithin days of Trump’s second election, Heather’s husband had actually moved out. “He said something stupid like, ‘I can’t sleep here anymore. I’m worried you guys are going to stab me in my sleep,’ ” Heather said. “I texted him, and so did my daughter, saying to him how we felt, and please don’t come home because we can’t see you tonight.” Their voting-age daughter refused to speak to her father beyond that; their nonbinary child told him that he had voted against their rights. Her husband’s response? “ ‘You don’t even know if I voted,’ ” Heather recounted. But he had: for Trump, as promised. (Beth’s husband did the same. Annie’s husband voted third party.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one sounded angrier about the results of the election than Heather. She was angry at Biden, at Harris, at left-leaning voters who declined to vote because of U.S. contributions to Palestinian deaths (“There is no genocide!” she told me, something she and her husband actually agreed on), at every nonwhite voter who went red (“Bye, Muslims and Latinos. If you’re stupid enough to vote for Donald Trump after what he said he would do to you, you get what you get!”), and at everyone else “too stupid” to vote blue. She was especially furious with the people who had voted Trump back into office. “I have nothing left for these people,” she declared. “Deport every MAGA out there and put them on an island. They’re a danger to the human race.”\n\nWhile I was on the phone with Heather, there was a knock at her front door: It was a process server, there to serve her husband with the divorce papers she had filed a week earlier. After all, they still share the same address. “I can’t sign for that, right?” she asked. “They’re my divorce papers.” The server promised to come back another day.\n\nAfter the Inauguration\n\nA few days after Trump’s inauguration—when Melania Trump stepped out in her social-distancing hat and sparked a new round of speculation about her own marriage—Heather texted me that she had a “surprising” update. Her house remains on the market, and her husband hasn’t returned home after he moved out following Election Day. The big update, instead, is that despite filing divorce papers, Heather doesn’t want to get divorced anymore. She’s now really hoping her husband comes home.\n\n“I realize I made a major mistake the last nine years. After the election, I turned off cable news and I got my ass off Twitter,” she says. (She’s moved over to Bluesky.) Heather now thinks she pushed her husband toward voting for Trump by having had such a noisy reaction to his support in the first place, eight years ago. “If I had just had a more reasonable reaction, and talked to him reasonably, maybe he would have listened to me,” she says. “He’s not right about Donald Trump, but was it important enough to destroy a 25-year marriage? There was a lot of marriage before there was a Donald Trump.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that Heather’s husband doesn’t seem to have the same regrets. He’s told her that he has no intention of returning to their shared home, or to their marriage at all. So she’s still selling the house, and her life is completely in flux. “I feel heartbroken,” Heather says. “I fought for eight years against Trump, because I felt it was the right thing to do. Where did it get me? Trump is president, and no marriage.”\n\nIn November, Heather was looking forward to going out with someone new whom she might be able to have a “sane” conversation with. It turns out, in the intervening weeks, she did go on a few dates, but it wasn’t the panacea she was hoping for. “Sure, we got to talk about Trump, yeah, OK, whatever. They’re not the person I was married to for 17 years,” she says.\n\nHeather’s despair over her personal life has led to one unexpected result: She just doesn’t give a shit about politics anymore. Her own proud Judaism notwithstanding, even Elon Musk’s Nazi salute didn’t get her goat the way it might have a few years or even months ago. She’s tired. She doesn’t want to argue anymore. And while she’s continuing her yearslong work with local Democrats to get them elected during the midterms, she no longer wants to talk about politics at the dinner table. “I don’t feel like I’m capitulating to Trump by wanting my marriage back,” she says. She has succumbed to what she views as the futility of resistance. “More people think the way he does, and they’re living happier lives,” she says. “And I just want to lead a happy life.”\n\nBeth, too, hasn’t gone through with a divorce, at least not yet. Her exhaustion still lingers from the first Trump administration, the pandemic, and cancer. She’s been overwhelmed by the emotional and tangible process that comes with divorce. She and her family went on that beach vacation, which did help her and her husband with their sniping. For now, they’re suspended in a holding pattern, and maybe that’s enough until she can chart her next move. She’s still conflicted between her own happiness and her sense of duty. “I feel like I’ll be letting people down if I don’t proceed with the divorce,” she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeth did decide to pay a small deposit for a lawyer, the same one she’s been talking to since 2016. “He said, ‘Oh, you are not the first client I’ve had come through the door in the last eight years who has said that Trump is the reason they’ve come to see me,’ ” Beth says. “He said he’s had at least five cases where the woman ended the marriage because she found out who her spouse really was.” It’s not a retainer, but it does mean she has an attorney ready to go if she ever does decide to file. “I still feel deeply humiliated that he supports this new presidency,” she says. “At some point, am I just going to be so disgusted and demoralized that I can’t live with this person anymore? I don’t know.”\n\nInstead of fighting with her husband, Beth is preparing for other possible disasters in her future, like if their kids lose their health insurance should Trump wipe out the Affordable Care Act. “There’s no way on God’s green earth that I am letting my children go without health insurance,” she says. “I will be making sure they have coverage no matter what it takes, even if I have to delay my own retirement.”\n\nIn the end, it’s money that Beth is thinking about most, namely how leaving her husband might penalize her financially in her mid-50s, when she should be gearing up for the retirement she’s so looking forward to. If they do divorce, that means they would have their own bank accounts, and he wouldn’t have to split expenses with her—including health care for their adult kids if they need it in the future. She’s also considering her sizable pension, which could get cut in half if she does leave. “That pension is the biggest asset we own as a family,” she says. Emotional freedom is one thing, but what of financial freedom? What kind of life can Beth have if she’s working harder and longer to make up for an ugly divorce?\n\nBut it’s not as if they aren’t fighting right now, even in their postvacation glow. Their latest ugliness was over whether Republican Sen. Deb Fischer’s husband declined to shake Kamala Harris’ hand while his wife was being sworn into Congress. “To me, that moment just epitomizes the whole gaslighting aspect. That’s a big part of the problem in our marriage, is that he’s trying to convince me to not believe what I saw and heard with my own eyes and ears,” she says. “I am not crazy, and I am not unreasonable. Don’t you dare pull that stuff with me.”\n\nOnly Annie has a more optimistic view of her marriage in 2025. With Musk’s Hitleresque performance still trending, her husband has since grown tired of the shtick. Maybe it’s still funny to her husband when someone as out of control as Trump behaves like someone out of control, but a powerful billionaire like Elon Musk doesn’t get the same reaction out of him. She showed her husband the video of Musk the night it blew up. “That’s made a few pennies drop,” she says. “We were just speechless. Obviously we always knew that was an undercurrent to all of this stuff, but for it to be so blatant, I just couldn’t believe it.”\n\nAnnie says that it feels as if her husband, at long last, is in reality with her, though they’re still working on his grasp of feminism and women’s rights. Her husband’s liberal radicalization has gone so swimmingly, in fact, that he’s also considering an out-of-country move. “We’re looking into Hong Kong and Singapore,” she says. “Divorce isn’t something that I’m thinking about.”\n\nIn October, before the election results were clear, I asked Beth if she still loved her husband. Based on her own retelling of the late stage of her marriage, he was going to vote against the interests of their kids, he ignored the warnings from his wife, he neglected his family through a pandemic, and he offered almost no flexibility on a political ideology that scared the shit out of his entire family. But once, decades ago, they were just a couple. It used to be just the two of them, in 2000 or 2001 or 2002, when politics somehow seemed simpler. There were, at least, fewer mainstream Nazis to contend with back then. It’s hard to walk away from two decades together, two children, and a united path that one day diverged. “I will love him until my last breath,” Beth told me.\n\nAs of late February, she’s still married to her husband. All three of them are.",

Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nA year or so ago, a small clique of people were nasty to me online over a piece of fan fiction I had written. They insulted and threatened me, and implied that I was a horrible person in real life for writing a story involving sex crimes. I did not react to them directly, but ever since then, I have not been able to stop following and trolling them online. They all have websites where you can send them anonymous messages, and just by sending carefully crafted messages, in varying “voices” both hostile and friendly, I have been able to provoke some hilarious textual freakouts and reported meltdowns from them.\n\nHowever, I’m getting worried because at least one of them seems pretty mentally unstable and I would feel genuinely guilty if my vengeful and juvenile diversion contributed even partially toward them hurting themselves or anyone else. I’ve resolved several times to stop, but can’t manage to stay away from their sites for more than a week or two. What they said to and about me did genuinely hurt, and still does when I think about it, but the level of ongoing resentment and fixation I feel is frankly disproportionate. What should I do?\n\n—Troubled Troll\n\nDear Troubled Troll,\n\nIt sounds like you’re being quite a bully. Obviously, I think you should stop harassing these people online immediately—use productivity software or parental controls to block these websites from your computer. Do whatever it takes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou have a real vindictive streak, but it appears that you also happen to have the best outlet in the world for this kind of fixation, which is: writing.

I mean I get it for birthday presents, but my mom is constantly trying to help out by buying me things she “thinks will be helpful.” But she never actually asks what I need! For example, right now my partner, our 3-year-old, and I are all extremely sick with the seasonal flu. My mom lives five hours away so she ordered a bunch of groceries to be delivered to us without telling me. It’s sweet but we don’t need generic groceries, as we already had a local friend bring us some, and we don’t have space in the fridge. Now we have to spend time trying to clean out the fridge to make space for all her food when we’d rather be lying on the couch feeling like we are dying. But do you know what we do need? Tylenol! She could have just asked us how she could be helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is this happens all the time. No matter how many times I politely say, “Hey that’s really nice Mom, but next time can you please ask us what would be helpful first? We already have this,” she never changes. Dealing with it when I’m this sick is just too far. I get that sometimes surprises are fun. But what’s more fun is doing something that’s actually appreciated!\n\n—Too Sick to Clean the Fridge\n\nDear Too Sick,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt certainly sounds like your mother is not attuned to your actual needs—versus the ones she imagines you have—and that’s frustrating. If I were to try to guess at the root behind her strange gift-giving habits, I would say that there’s a facet about her obsession with the surprise element that’s very “Mother knows best.” Or more likely, it’s as if your mother would rather not risk a situation where you have actual expectations or things you need from her, and she has to risk letting you down by not meeting them. A surprise gift, after all, comes without any expectation and therefore can never be disappointing (at least, according to your mother’s logic). In any case, I don’t think it’s helpful for you to reason with her on this subject any more; it just might be helpful—and make you feel less aggravated—to consider what your mother’s motives may be in this situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for how to handle her future unwanted gifts, try instituting a blanket “no gifts” rule for a while with your mother. If she insists on sending you random groceries or stuff despite this boundary, I think it’s fine to throw them out or give them away, and tell her that you had to do so. She obviously has her own expectations for how you react or use her packages, so you’ll have to get some practice telling her directly and unapologetically that you passed her generous gifts on to someone who can actually use it. And the next time you’re in the midst of an illness, it may be helpful to keep your distance from your mother (or not tell her that you’re sick at all); why worry or activate her unnecessarily?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nThe columnists behind our advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nThe government and inflation are unstable, and I am quitting my perfectly fine job with kind co-workers to pursue my artistic dreams. I have enough in savings, but what if the stock market crashes? Am I insane for doing this?\n\n—Creative in the Time of Chaos\n\nDear Creative Chaos,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf nothing is guaranteed (and yes, things do look precipitously dicey, don’t they?) why not start living the life you want now?\n\nYou could spend decades sitting in an office awaiting the perfect political and economic conditions to make your art. Or you could be brave and join your fellow artists in our attempts to make something—anything!—meaningful out of all this turmoil.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI scheduled a yoga retreat to Thailand many months ago, a treat to celebrate the end of my 200-hour yoga teacher training. I’ve been looking forward to the solitude and relaxation, but was contacted today by an old roommate, who announced she wants to join me. Evidently, she is on my yoga teacher’s email list (why, I do not know, as she does not practice yoga). I did not invite her, nor have I ever shared any details of my trip with her. I am gutted. She has never traveled internationally, let alone undertaken a flight that will require three exchanges and over 23 hours of travel.\n\nMost worrisome to me is her health. I’ve known her to have very poor health for over 20 years, ranging from heart palpitations to seizures, migraines, and muscle weakness so severe that she claims she often can’t walk. She doesn’t believe in “Western medicine” so to my knowledge is not receiving treatment. I feel cornered. Clearly, she sees this as her big chance to visit Thailand. Whereas my yogic retreat feels suddenly upended, into a time of babysitting and forced socialization. At the same time, anyone could sign up for this retreat; it’s not mine to control, and who am I to stand in the way of her travel dreams?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel terrible about resenting her intrusion. She said she’ll think about it for a few days, as she has to consider how hard this long trip will be on her body (I didn’t remind her that jet lag is also a thing). Any advice on what I could possibly say to her as she’s making her decision? Should I be brutally honest and then inevitably face feeling like a bad person? Am I justified in feeling like I’ve been placed in an unfair situation by an uninvited guest?\n\n—The Saddest Yogi\n\nDear Saddest Yogi,\n\nNow that’s a plot twist worthy of “The White Lotus”!\n\nEven if this old roommate winds up on this retreat with you, remind yourself that you’re an adult who can set boundaries and excuse yourself from any obligation in pursuit of “alone time” or “focusing on the yoga.” Plus, I’m guessing it’s been a while since you’ve seen this person. Maybe they’ve totally changed in ways that you can’t predict!\n\nBut if you want help in planting some seeds of doubt in your roommate, I would say something like, “I heard this retreat is super intense, and Thailand is hard to navigate! I don’t know about you, but I’m spending all my free time preparing for such an ambitious trip.” Chances are that if you seem intimidated, you might inspire some intimidation and second thoughts in her, too.\n\n—Delia\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nIt was my daughter’s 2nd birthday, and we had both of my husband’s sisters at our house with their husbands. One of those sisters has three kids, who were also there (ages 4, 3, and 9 months). My 6-year-old daughter was also present. Shortly after the birthday cake, I found a small bag of cocaine on top of my trash can. I questioned everyone where it had come from. My brother-in-law (the one without kids) confessed that he had dropped it and that he had bought it for later in the week.",
