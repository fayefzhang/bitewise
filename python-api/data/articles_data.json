        "content": "\"Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America,\" Altman wrote in 2016. The day after PresidentDonald Trumpreturned to office, Sam Altman, the CEO of tech giant OpenAI, stood behind the presidential seal at the White House and praised the newly sworn-in president for the $500 billion \"Stargate\" initiative he was joining to build an artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. Altman said it wouldn't have been possible without Trump. \"For AGI [artificial general intelligence] to get built here, to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, to create a new industry centered here, we wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President, and I'm thrilled that we get to,\" Altman said as he and other industry leaderssmiled for photosin the Roosevelt Room. The chummy announcement represented a stark reversal for Altman, who -- in the early days of Trump's first term -- emerged as one of Silicon Valley's first and most vocal critics of the president. From 2016 through 2022, Altman repeatedly warned about what he saw as the dangers posed by Trump's leadership and his policies. During the 2016 campaign, he compared Trump to Hitler in 1930s Germany, and he called on other tech companies to stand against Trump in the early days of the new administration. He donated hundreds of thousands to Democratic causes and candidates, including $200,000 to help reelect President Joe Biden in 2024. After Trump announced the \"Stargate\" deal, the OpenAI CEO appeared to address his reversal in a post on X, writing that \"watching [Trump] more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him,\" and adding, \"I'm not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!\" Other tech leaders have shifted their stance on Trump in recent years, even more so since his 2024 election win. Earlier this month, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announced theend of its fact-checkingprogram and eased restrictions on discussions about topics such as immigration and gender identity, following longstanding criticism from President Trump and his allies. Altman's public opposition to Trump began during the 2016 presidential campaign when, in October of that year, Altman made his first-ever presidential endorsement by backing Hillary Clinton. \"I am endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. I've never endorsed a presidential candidate before, but I'm making an exception this year, because this election is exceptional,\" Altman wrote in ablog poston Oct. 16, 2016, titled \"The 2016 Election.\" \"Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America, and voting for Hillary is the best way to defend our country against it,\" Altman wrote. Months earlier, in the heat of the presidential campaign, Altman had published ascathing critiqueof Trump, writing, \"He is irresponsible in the way dictators are.\" \"To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it's chilling to watch Trump in action,\" Altman wrote in June 2016. \"Though I know intellectually it's easy in hard economic times to rile people up with a hatred of outsiders, it's still surprising to watch this happen right in front of us.\" \"Hitler taught us about the Big Lie -- the lie so big, and so often repeated, that people end up believing it,\" Altman wrote. \"Trump's Big Lie is hiding in plain sight. His Big Lie is that he's going to Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders.\" After Trump's victory, Altman called on his fellow tech leaders to \"take a stand\" against the new Trump administration in the wake of Trump's executive order known as the so-calledMuslim ban, which Trump called \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" Altman called the 2017 order \"a breach of America's contract with all the immigrants in the nation.\" The order spurred nationwide protests and legal challenges before being modified and then overturned by President Biden in 2021. He urged the tech industry to take action, writing on his personal blog, \"The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally.\" He added that employees at tech companies \"should push their companies to figure out what actions they can take.\" \"It would be particularly embarrassing for us to fall for this -- we are a nation of immigrants, and we know that immigrants built this country (and Trump, of course, is the grandson of immigrants and married to an immigrant),\" Altman wrote. Altman himself took action by launching a website called \"Track Trump,\" which monitored Trump's fulfillment of his 2016 campaign promises over his first 100 days in office. He shared the website in a February 2017 tweet in which he said, \"For all the noise, Trump hasn't actually done very much yet.\" Altman's public criticism continued throughout Trump's first presidency. In a March 2017 tweet, Altman posted, \"I think Trump is terrible and few things would make me happier than him not being president.\" \"If you elect a reality TV star as President, you can't be surprised when you get a reality TV show,\" Altmanwrotein July 2017. At a \"Talks with Google\" event in October 2017, Altmandefendedhis outspoken criticism of Trump. Acknowledging that \"if you \"piss off the president, he might do bad things to you,\" Altman nevertheless said that \"when the future of the republic is at risk, the duty to the country and our values transcends the duty to your particular company and your stock price.\" \"I think I started that a little bit earlier than other people, but at this point I am in really good company,\" Altman added. Later, in the wake of Trump's 2020 election loss, AltmanpraisedLinkedIn chairman and Democratic supporter Reid Hoffman, writing on Twitter, \"Very few people realize just how much @reidhoffman did and spent to stop Trump from getting re-elected -- it seems reasonably likely to me that Trump would still be in office without his efforts. Thank you, Reid!\" In recent years, Altman has himself contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes, including giving $200,000 in 2023 to the Biden Victory Fund, the joint fundraising committee that sought to reelect Joe Biden in 2024, according to federal election commission records reviewed by ABC News. Early in the 2020 election cycle, he contributed to a slew of Democratic primary presidential contenders, including to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, then-Sen. Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang, then later gave $100,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign. He also gave $100,000 each to the pro-Democratic super PACs American Bridge PAC and Senate Majority PAC. He wasn't an active political contributor during the 2016 election cycle, but gave a total of $1,500 to the Obama campaign in 2008 and 2012. Although Altman has almost exclusively donated to Democrats, he has also donated to a handful of Republicans, including California Reps. Darrell Issa and Jay Obernolte, Rep. John Curtis of Utah, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Then, after Trump was reelected this past November, Altman was among the first corporate executives to publicly announce their donation to the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, as tech companies including Meta and Amazon lined up tofinancially supportTrump's inauguration. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to ABC News that Altman donated $1 million to the inaugural committee in December. Last Monday, Altman was among the select number of tech executives spotted attending Trump's swearing-in ceremony inside the Capitol rotunda. \"President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\" Altman wrote in a statement to ABC News at the time about his inauguration contribution. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "content": "The president is being sued by two co-founders of his Trump Media company. In a case that sits squarely at the intersection of his business and political interests, PresidentDonald Trumpis trying to stop a civil lawsuit against his multibillion-dollar social media company by arguing that he should be immune from civil litigation filed in state court while he serves as president. Trump and his co-defendants -- including FBI director nominee Kash Patel and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino -- asked a Delaware judge to either issue a four-year delay of the case or dismiss a lawsuit filed by Trump Media& Technology Group co-founders Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, who alleged that Trump and company executives orchestrated a scheme to prevent them fromgetting their full stakein the company after it went public. Facing an \"unprecedented\" number of civil lawsuits, Trump argued that having to fend off the litigation would be a \"distraction\" from his presidential duties and \"interfere substantially\" with the function of the executive branch. \"Without the protections of temporary Presidential immunity, the President will be forced to defend against these cases -- and the many more that are sure to arise during his second term -- all to the detriment of his office and the American people he serves,\" attorneys John Reed and Theodore Kittila wrote in a filing on Friday in Delaware Chancery Court. In December, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Morgan Zurn agreed to temporarily pause the claim so Trump could make his immunity argument, though she noted that Trump \"is not presently deemed to be immune\" from the civil case. Lawyers for Trump Media and the president asked the court to establish a \"brightline deferral rule\" to delay any civil litigation Trump faces in state court by four years. \"State courts across the country are being called upon to sit in judgment of the sitting President, to tax his time, and to second-guess his priorities. That state of affairs -- President Jefferson's nightmare -- dishonors the Presidency and debases the state courts that purport to control his actions,\" the filing said. During his first term in office, Trump was sued at least 10 times, and he returned to the presidency with at least 14 lawsuits pending, including multiple suits related to his social media company. Trump placed hisstake in the company-- 14,750,000 shares worth more than $3 billion -- into a trust controlled by his sons before entering office this month. If successful, Trump's claim of \"temporary presidential immunity\" could provide the president an additional layer of legal protection, having already entered office with newly broadened presidential power and protection from criminal liability following theSupreme Court's rulinglast year on presidential immunity. Defense lawyers, in Friday's filing, claimed without evidence that Trump's \"billionaire adversaries\" are funding a wave of litigation \"to destroy the president.\" \"The President has already been sued more than all his predecessors combined, yet his rivals promise that there is still more to come,\" the lawsuit said. \"That swell of litigation will pose an even greater threat to the operations of the Executive Branch and the standing of state courts that purport to sit in judgment of his conduct.\" While the Supreme Court established in Clinton v. Jones that a president does not have immunity from civil lawsuits related to personal conduct, lawyers for Trump Media argued that the decision only applies to cases in federal court. Though the Trump Media lawsuit does not center on official acts, Trump argued that the burden of defending himself would intrude on his official duties, citing an example of how President Bill Clinton consulted his personal attorney three times on the same day he was deliberating whether to go to war with Iraq. \"With the benefits of hindsight and lived experience, it now is clear that state civil litigation against the President causes real 'diversion' and 'harassment' of the Presidency, sufficient to interfere substantially with the operations of the Executive Branch,\" the filing said. The defense lawyers claimed that the lawsuit would occupy Trump's limited \"energies and attention,\" which is already strained by the demands of the presidency. \"During his first term, President Trump ... slept just four to five hours per night -- because the burdens of the Presidency dwarfed even his responsibilities as a global business leader,\" the filing said. In a separate filing on Friday, Trump's personal lawyers told the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that the president should be immune from any civil claims related to theJan. 6 Capitol attackbecause he was acting in his official capacity as president when he sought to challenge the results of the 2020 election. When reached for comment, regarding the Trump Media lawsuit, Richie Jones, an attorney for Moss and Litinsky, provided a quote by former President Theodore Roosevelt, saying it was \"the best we can do in terms of comment.\" \"No man is above the law, and no man is below it. Nor do we ask any man's permission when we require him to obey it,\" Jones wrote. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "content": "Thomas Mascia is accused of staging the shooting for \"attention or sympathy.\" A New York state trooper who claimed to have been shot in the line of duty in October is now facing criminal charges for having allegedly \"staged\" the shooting, according to officials. Thomas Mascia, 27, surrendered to police Monday morning, a spokesperson for the Nassau County District Attorney's Office told ABC News. He faces charges of official misconduct, falsely reporting a crime and tampering with evidence. In a press conference Monday, Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly said Mascia could face one to three years in prison for the \"unconscionable\" deception. \"He knew the fear that it would create -- and he did it anyway,\" Donnelly said. Mascia's parents, Dorothy and Thomas, also surrendered to police on Monday on charges of criminal possession of a firearm, the district attorney's office said. The firearm was not the same one used in the shooting, but Mascia's father is a convicted felon, making it illegal for him to own a gun, Donnelly said. Mascia's father, a former New York Police Department officer, was dismissed from the force in 1993 over accusations of running a cocaine ring, according toThe New York Times. Police matched the gun used in the shooting to one owned by Mascia, officials sad. It was not his service weapon, officials said. There was also \"close to $800,000\" found at the family's home, Donnelly said. All three were released on their own recognizance Monday. Mascia was on duty Oct. 30 in Hempstead when he \"initiated a radio transmission for shots fired,\" according to a felony complaint obtained by ABC News. He then \"claimed he was shot by the driver of a black Dodger Charger described as either a Black or dark-skinned Hispanic male.\" The complaint alleges Mascia actually \"staged the scene of the shooting,\" placing shell casings on the ground hours earlier. He then allegedly \"shot himself in the leg in another location before returning to the staged location\" on the Southern State Parkway. State police temporarily shut down the section of the parkway where Mascia claimed the incident occurred \"in an effort to locate the non-existent shooters, causing alarm and inconvenience to the public,\" the complaint states. The complaint accuses Mascia of staging the shooting \"for the benefit of gaining attention or sympathy for himself.\" An attorney representing Mascia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He is expected to make his next court appearance Feb. 5. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "content": "Thirty-three hostages are set to be released in the ceasefire's first phase. Many residents of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon are expected to return to their homes in the coming days and weeks, with most of the fighting in both areas paused under Israeli ceasefire agreements withHamasandHezbollah. Under Israel's multi-phased deal with Hamas, somehostagesheld in the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails have started to be released. Negotiations between Israel and Hamas are expected to continue amid the first phase of the deal, which was slated to last about six weeks. Emotional scenes played out all over the Gaza Strip on Monday as families and friends reunited for the first time in over 15 months after the Israeli military allowed movement between northern and southern Gaza. A sea of people swept the shoreline heading north along the sandy remains of the coastal highway. Many traveled on foot trudging through sand, a Palestinian flag flickering in the wind above them.   \"It feels like we're reborn!\" Om Wael, a grandmother from Gaza City, told ABC News as she carried her granddaughter in her arms, with a look of joyful determination on her face. \"Even if our home is flattened, we're so happy to return to our city, to our homes, unharmed. Thank God,\" she said. Mirvat Ajur, 29, from the Daraj neighborhood in central Gaza City, told ABC News that she walked for about five hours until she reached central Gaza. \"It was a difficult journey, but the people were very happy, singing, clapping and dancing in joy at returning to their homes,\" she said.   Approximately 300,000 people made the journey home, according to figures released by Gazan authorities. Samira Halas, 55, was among them. \"I know that my home is damaged and burned, but I want to return to it,\" Halas, from Gaza City’s Shuja'iyya neighborhood, told ABC News, describing the destruction she saw upon her return \"like an earthquake had hit it.\" \"I want to live in those burned and destroyed rooms,\" she continued. \"I am like a fish dying far from the sea.\" -ABC News' Ruwaida Amer and Zoe Magee At least 300,000 Palestinians returned home to northern Gaza on Monday, according to the Gaza government office, after Israel allowed them to cross into the north for the first time in over a year.       As people return to northern Gaza on Monday, the Gaza government said it \"immediately and urgently\" needs at least 135,000 tents because 90% of the buildings have been destroyed. The government called on the international community to help provide \"basic supplies\" for Palestinians.   Of the 33 Israeli hostages set to be released during the first phase of the ceasefire, eight have been killed by Hamas, according to Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer. Seven hostages have already been released since the start of the ceasefire, meaning 18 more living hostages will be released by Hamas in the coming weeks. More hostages are set to be released on Thursday and Saturday, Mencer said.  ",

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "The emergence of DeepSeek sent some tech stocks tumbling. China-based AI appDeepSeek, which sits atop the app store charts, made its presence widely known Monday by triggering a sharp drop in share prices for sometech giants. Shares of Nvidia, the top AI chipmaker, plunged more than 17% in early trading on Monday, losing nearly $590 billion in market value. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3.5%. The DeepSeek chatbot, known as R1, responds to user queries just like its U.S.-based counterparts. Early testingreleased by DeepSeeksuggests that its quality rivals that of other AI products, while the company says it costs less and uses far fewer specialized chips than do its competitors. The product could upend the AI industry, putting pressure on other firms to lower their costs while intensifying competition between U.S. and Chinese companies, analysts told ABC News. Concerns about data security and censorship also may expose DeepSeek to the type of scrutiny endured by social media platform TikTok, the experts added. \"This is a big moment,\" Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus of psychology and neuroscience at New York University, who specializes in AI, told ABC News. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Here's what to know about DeepSeek, and its implications for the future of AI. DeepSeek, like OpenAI'sChatGPT, is a chatbot fueled by an algorithm that selects words based on lessons learned from scanning billions of pieces of text across the internet. While made in China, the app is available in multiple languages, including English. DeepSeek soared to the top of Apple's App Store chart over the weekend and remained there as of Monday. The company said it experienced some outages on Monday affecting user signups. \"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" DeepSeeksaidin a statement. DeepSeek is fully available to users free of charge. By contrast, ChatGPT retains a version available for free, but offers paid monthly tiers of $20 and $200 to access additional capabilities. Developers of the system powering the DeepSeek AI, called DeepSeek-V3, published aresearch paperindicating that the technology relies on much fewer specialized computer chips than its U.S. competitors do. DeepSeek also says that it developed the chatbot for only $5.6 million, which if true is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by U.S. companies in the sector. \"The lower cost to train DeepSeek means it can be offered at a lower cost,\" Oren Etzioni, CEO of Allen Institute for AI and a computer science professor at the University of Washington, told ABC News. \"That puts pressure on other companies to lower their prices.\" DeepSeek's developers opted to release it as anopen-sourceproduct, meaning the code that underlies the AI system is publicly available for other companies to adapt and build upon. Llama, the AI model released by Meta in 2017, is also open source. By contrast, ChatGPT as well as Alphabet's Gemini are closed-source models. Proponents of open source say that publicly available code allows a wide community of AI engineers to identify and fix flaws in a system, or tailor it for a purpose separate from its originally intended function. Supporters of closed source argue that the best way to safeguard AI is to keep the computer code private so it stays out of the hands of bad actors who might repurpose it for malicious ends. DeepSeek flexes the strength of the Chinese tech sector in an industry previously viewed by many analysts as one dominated by U.S. firms, experts said. For some, the sudden arrival of a top China-based competitor raises concerns about data security and content manipulation similar to those leveled atTikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. Regarding the former users on social media have posted numerous examples of DeepSeek choosing to forego answers on topics potentially sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of anti-government protestors. \"It's clear that there's some censorship built into the system,\" Marcus said. \"We don't want governments in control of what people can say.\" Both foreign-owned and U.S.-based AI chatbots pose data concerns, however, since users sometimes enter personal or intimate information, which in turn could be used for commercial purposes, Marcus added. \"You have to assume that anything you type into a large language model could be seen by someone else,\" Marcus said. Still, DeepSeek's low-cost technological advance using outdated chips marks a major new entry into the AI market, Sosnick said, in turn forcing people to \"rethink assumptions that they had.\" The emergence of a relatively cost-efficient alternative to other AI chatbots helps explain Monday's dip in the share value of Nvidia, which premises future growth on increased demand for new, expensive chips, Etzioni said. In a statement to ABC News, Nvidia described DeepSeek as \"an excellent AI advancement,\" noting how the firm leveraged \"widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant\" – the latter apparently referring to controls put in place by the Biden administration that prohibit U.S. manufacturers from selling such specialized chips to firms in China. Etzioni said the open-source nature of DeepSeek also could challenge the profitability of other AI firms aiming to charge third parties for access to their products. \"We're soon going to see many models built on DeepSeek,\" Etzioni said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "content": "The number marked an increase from Sunday's arrests. President Donald Trump is carrying out his immigration crackdown nationwide, with nearly 1,000 arrests reported by ICE on Sunday alone. The actions prompted a tense standoff between the U.S. and Colombia after Colombia's president turned away deportation flights from the U.S. Trump then threatened tariffs as high as 25% against the South American nation, causing its leader to reverse course and accept deported migrants. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived for his first full day at the Pentagon after being narrowly confirmed by the Senate. Trump's other Cabinet picks, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, will face confirmation hearings later this week. The White House budget office is ordering federal agencies to cease any financial assistance spending if they suspect the program might conflict with President Donald Trump's executive orders. In a memo obtained by ABC News, Matthew Vaeth, acting director of the Office and Management and Budget, told agency chiefs that they must report back by Feb. 10 on all programs that apply. \"The memo requires federal agencies to identify and review all federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities consistent with the President's policies and requirements,\" according to the document. The memo says it is directed at programs providing \"financial assistance for foreign aid, non-governmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology and the Green New Deal.\" The order does not specify which financial aid programs would have to be suspended, although it could have sweeping implications. The federal government funds thousands of programs, including research programs, housing subsidies and educational grants. Five Quaker congregations sued the Department of Homeland Security on Monday over last week's policy reversal that allows immigration agents to conduct searches and arrests in so-called “sensitive areas” like churches and schools. The Quaker groups, known as the Religious Society of Friends, alleged that the policy change harms their congregations by deterring immigrants from worshipping in person, violating their First Amendment rights to freely associate and exercise religion. “Allowing armed government agents wearing ICE-emblazoned jackets to park outside a religious service and monitor who enters or to interrupt the service and drag a congregant out during the middle of worship is anathema to Quaker religious exercise,” the federal lawsuit filed in Maryland said. Quaker worship generally involves multiple congregants sitting together in silence to await a message from God, which can be received and shared by anyone in attendance, according to the lawsuit. “Being able to receive those messages is fundamental to Quaker religious exercise,” the lawsuit said. “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest,” Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman said in a statement announcing the policy change on Jan. 24. “The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.” -ABC News' Peter Charalambous, James Hill and Laura Romero Trump said Monday he wants to deport repeat criminal offenders who are in the U.S. legally, offering that they be held in foreign jails. \"I don't want these violent repeat offenders in our country any more than I want illegal aliens from other countries who misbehave,” Trump said during his remarks at the House GOP retreat.   \"This is subject to getting it approved, but if they've been arrested many, many times, they're repeat offenders by many numbers, I want them out of our country,” he added. \"We'll be seeking permission to do so. We're going to get approval hopefully to get them the hell out of our country along with others.\" Trump suggested that they could be maintained in a foreign country \"for a very small fee.\" -ABC News' Fritz Farrow   The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it arrested 1,749 undocumented immigrants on Monday. That marks an increase from Sunday, when the agency said it made 956 such arrests. ICE is operating at an increased tempo since the new administration took office. -ABC News' Luke Barr",

She first wore a navy and ivory ensemble, complete with a hat, from American designer Adam Lippes for the swearing-in ceremony. For the evening's inaugural balls, she donned a black-and-white gown designed by her longtime stylist Herve Pierre. She also joined President Trump as he surveyed hurricane damage in North Carolina last Friday. The two celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary last week.

Instead of talking about school and friends, her days are filled with memories of the family she lost and the uncertainty of her future afterIsraeland Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement on Jan. 15. Alma, who is 12 years old, is the sole survivor of her family after her home was bombed in December 2023 in Gaza City. Soon, she will return — not to the home she once knew, but to a graveyard where her parents and siblings rest. \"My mother, father, and brothers are all buried in one grave in our home in Gaza City,\" she told ABC News. \"I want to see them, say goodbye. But what will I do after that? There is no home to return to, no one waiting for me.\" After 15 months of living in displacement camps because of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, Alma and others like her will be allowed to return to northern Gaza on Saturday. But for Alma, returning without her family is difficult, she told ABC News. Alma's story is one of countless others unfolding across Gaza, where children like her face unimaginable challenges. The ongoing conflict has left over 17,000 children separated from their parents, according to UNICEF. Amid the challenges Alma has faced, she has one wish. \"I want to make my parents proud of me in heaven,\" Alma told ABC News. Her hope is to become a doctor, fulfilling a desire that her late father always encouraged, she said. \"Through education, I can achieve my goals. I will work hard to make my father proud,\" Alma added. Alma has been living in a tent at the Al-Barakah Orphanage Camp in Khan Younis. Mahmoud Kalakh, the camp's director, said the children in the orphanage display resilience, despite the tragedy around them. \"These children carry the weight of tragedy, yet they still dream of a better future,\" he said. \"Our role is to provide them with the support they need to heal and rebuild their lives.\" UNICEF and other humanitarian organizations have called for urgent support for children like Alma. The loss of family, education and basic necessities has created a crisis that requires immediate global attention, global aid organizations say. \"Children are the most vulnerable in conflicts,\" a UNICEF spokesperson said. \"We must ensure they have the resources and care they need to survive and thrive.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "content": "The administration has paused almost all U.S. assistance for 90 days. Internal communications reviewed by ABC News show that the Trump administration plans to strictly implement an executive order from the president mandating a 90-day freeze on almost all U.S. foreign aid amid a review, a measure that already has sparked widespread concern among humanitarian organizations. \"We get tired of giving massive amounts of money to countries that hate us, don't we?\" President Donald Trump said in a speech during the House Republicans' annual retreat in Florida on Monday, touting a blizzard of executive actions he had taken since returning to the White House. In a memo sent to U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) staff over the weekend, a high-level official within the agency stressed their \"responsibility\" to carry out Trump's directive and signaled that it would be difficult to secure waivers to continue funding for programs during the pause, which he called \"a complete halt.\" \"It is important to emphasize that it is no longer business as usual. Every program will be thoroughly scrutinized,\" Ken Jackson, USAID's assistant to the administrator for management and resources, wrote. Jackson said that the agency's only exceptions currently in place covered spending on emergency humanitarian food aid and travel for government officials who were returning to their duty stations, adding that employees should be ready \"to provide detailed information and justification\" for these expenses. Any waivers for other spending would need to clear multiple hurdles for approval, including proving that the program receiving funding was lifesaving or necessary for U.S. national security. Failure to comply with the pause or other new policies \"will result in disciplinary action,\" Jackson warned USAID staff. A separate memo sent to State Department employees last week which was also reviewed by ABC News instructed officials overseeing projects funded by grants and awards that have already been distributed to issue immediate \"stop-work orders,\" making exceptions for some travel and administrative expenses, emergency food aid, and foreign military financing to both Egypt and Israel. An administration official said on Monday that a template for submitting waiver requests had been made available and that the State Department was reviewing numerous applications that had already been submitted, but could not give a timeline for when any decisions would be made. The State Department officially announced the implementation of the freeze on Sunday. \"Secretary Rubio has paused all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for review,\" the department's spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, said in statement. \"He is initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.\" By then, panic had already set in among international aid groups that rely on U.S. funding. Sources within the international community said the freeze was so expansive that they could hardly believe it was real. \"The recent stop-work cable from the State Department suspends programs that support America's global leadership and creates dangerous vacuums that China and our adversaries will quickly fill,\" InterAction, the largest alliance of international aid organizations, said in a statement. \"This halt interrupts critical life-saving work including clean water to infants, basic education for kids, ending the trafficking of girls, and providing medications to children and others suffering from disease. It stops assistance in countries critical to U.S. interests, including Taiwan, Syria, and Pakistan. And, it halts decades of life-saving work through PEPFAR that helps babies to be born HIV-free,\" the statement continued. Beyond concern for their work, some organizations and officials have also expressed confusion. Many were caught off guard by the State Department's implementation of Trump's order, which they initially believed wouldn't impact programs funded through congressional appropriations. \"The aid community is grappling with just how existential this aid suspension is - we know this will have life or death consequences for millions around the globe, as programs that depend on this funding grind to a halt without a plan or safety net,\" Abby Maxman, the president and CEO of Oxfam, said in a statement to ABC News. \"This decision must be reversed, and funding and programming must be allowed to move forward. But at the very least, the administration must communicate clearly so the aid community can plan for the future and determine how to carry on our lifesaving work,\" Maxman added. Critics of the freeze believe dissent from international aid organizations and U.S. officials has been muted due to fear of retribution from the administration. In his memo to USAID employees, Jackson stipulated that one of the new policies they must comply with if they wished to avoid disciplinary action was a requirement that all external communication, including with the State Department, first be approved by the agency. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

Taxfiling season kicked off on Monday as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service began accepting completed tax forms. Americans can file anytime before April 15. The IRSsaidearlier this month that it expects more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed by that deadline. Refundsare typically sent within 21 days, the agency says. For paper returns, the IRS says turnaround time can last more than four weeks. The IRS is expanding a system that allows taxpayers to file directly with the agency, bypassing intermediary firms that often charge fees. The initiative,Direct File, will be made available to taxpayers in 25 states, more than doubling from 12 states last year, the IRS said. States newly offering Direct File include Alaska, Connecticut,Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine,Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. For the first time, the Direct File program will feature a “data-import tool” that allows tax filers to automatically enter information available in their IRS account, the agency said. Direct File works on mobile phones, laptops, tablets or desktop computers, the IRS said. Up to one in three Americans waits until the last minute to file their taxes, according to a 2021 survey byIPX 1031. That amounts to tens of millions of people. Taxpayers can typically file an extension that lasts six months, meaning those who obtain an extension will be allowed to submit their tax forms without penalty until Oct. 15. If a filer forgoes an extension and files late, the person risks additional fees for the tardy submission. The penalty amounts to 5% of the taxes owed for each month that the filing is late, up to a maximum of 25%. Under such circumstances, the IRS mails a letter or notice alerting the filer of a late fee. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

The Justice Department is firing \"over a dozen\" officials who were part of former special counsel Jack Smith's teams that prosecuted President Donald Trump, officials confirmed to ABC News Monday. Acting Attorney General James McHenry transmitted letters to the officials informing them of their termination, officials said, that said given their part in the prosecutions they couldn't be trusted in \"faithfully implementing the president's agenda.\" It's not immediately clear the exact number of officials who were fired on Monday, but the move was largely expected after President Trump's threats leading up to the 2024 election stating he planned to fire Smith \"on day one.\" Smith resigned prior to Trump taking office and submitted his final report to former Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland released Vol. 1 of Smith's final report detailing Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, but he was blocked by District Judge Aileen Cannon from sharing with Congress the second volume of Trump's report detailing his investigation of Trump's mishandling of classified documents after leaving his first administration. Separately, an official confirmed to ABC News that the top career official in the Justice Department, Bradley Weinsheimer, was recently informed he was being reassigned out of his role. Weinsheimer was a longtime career public official and gained notoriety last year in exchanges with President Joe Biden's attorneys as they sought to prevent Special Counsel Robert Hur from releasing portions of his final report that detailed Biden's diminished capacities. \"You played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,\" the email from Acting Attorney General McHenry said to the officials fired Monday. \"The proper functioning of the government critically depends on the trust superior officials place in their subordinates. Given your significant role in prosecuting the President, I do not believe that the leadership of the department can trust you to assist in implementing the President's agenda faithfully.\" While several career officials who played prominent roles in Smith's prosecutions departed prior to Trump taking office -- including former top DOJ national security official Jay Bratt -- several other career attorneys who were on Smith's team chose to remain and return to roles in DOJ's national security and criminal divisions. Among those officials were longtime career trial attorneys Molly Gaston, J.P. Cooney, Mary Dohrmann and Anne McNamara, all of whom were informed of their terminations Monday, an official confirmed to ABC News. It's likely the firings result in court challenges given extensive civil service protections afforded to longtime career officials. Mark Zaid, a prominent national security attorney who has represented federal officials and whistleblowers, said on 'X' Monday his firm is willing to represent pro bono any officials terminated for their roles in Smith's investigation. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

The incidents began just before 8:30 p.m. when officers responded to a report of a driver blocking someone's car at a Dollar General, Bercaw said. The two drivers argued and eventually the victim left, the chief said. Then, the victim noticed the suspect was following him to his house, and the two drivers threw items at each other, Bercaw said. The suspect then \"reversed out, hitting the victim with the car twice,\" the chief said. \"While this was happening, a friend of the victim was firing at the suspect in an attempt to stop this violent act.\" That first victim was listed in stable condition, the chief said. At 8:33 p.m., the suspect drove his white Honda in circles and then struck and killed a man in an apparently intentional act, police said. The suspect fled and then struck another pedestrian, who survived, police said. At 8:39 p.m., the suspect was seen driving toward pedestrians on a sidewalk, police said. The driver struck another man who was hospitalized with serious head injuries but is expected to be OK, Bercaw said. At 10:16 p.m., another call came in reporting that the driver intentionally veered into people, striking another person, Bercaw said. Police chased the suspect and eventually stopped his car, Bercaw said. \"The suspect was getting out of the car, reaching for what [officers] believed was a weapon, and then shots were fired,\" Bercaw said. \"The suspect did not survive.\" Three officers were injured in that incident; none of their injuries are life-threatening, Bercaw said. The 47-year-old suspect, whose name was not released, had an \"extensive violent criminal history\" and was released from prison about two years ago, the chief said. \"This was a violent night,\" the chief said. \"Our thoughts are with the family of the man who was killed,\" he added. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

The emergence of China-based AI app DeepSeek sent shares plummeting on Monday for many U.S.tech giants, including chipmakerNvidiaand AI-backer Microsoft. Nvidia, which helped catapult market wide gains in recent years, saw its share price plummet by more than 12% in early trading on Monday. Shares of Microsoft, a major stakeholder in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, fell about 4.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% in early trading on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also inched downward. The DeepSeek chatbot -- which responds to user queries, just like its U.S.-basedcounterparts-- stands atop the Apple app-store charts. Early testing suggests that the quality of DeepSeek rivals that of U.S.-based AI products. Developers of the system powering the AI, called DeepSeek-V3, published aresearch paperindicating that the technology relies on much fewer specialized computer chips than its U.S. competitors. DeepSeek has emerged despite export controls issued by the Biden administration that prohibit U.S. manufacturers from selling such specialized chips to firms in China. Ivan Feinseth, a market analyst at Tigress Financial, described DeepSeek as \"the first shot at what is emerging as a global AI space race.\" \"The potential power and low-cost development of DeepSeek is calling into question the hundreds of billions of dollars committed in the U.S,\" Feinseth said in a note to clients on Monday. Alphabet, the company behind AI chatbot Gemini, saw shares drop about 3% on Monday. The stock price of Amazon, which offers its own AI-fueled shopping assistant, also fell about 3%. The dip interrupts a yearslongsurgefor many tech giants, driven in part by enthusiasm about the future of AI. The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed more than 30% in 2024, sustaining much of its sky-high 43% growth over the year prior. Many analysts expected those robust gains to continue this year. \"When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis.

The first shooting incident was reported around 9:25 p.m. in Center City when officers located a 20-year-old man suffering from a gunshot wound. The victim was transported to a nearby hospital in stable condition. No suspects have been identified, police said. Later that night, a 39-year-old man driving on Broad Street in the Spring Garden neighborhood was also injured after gunshots were fired from a crowd, police said. The man arrived at a local hospital around 11:20 p.m. with two graze wounds to his chest and stomach, police said. No arrests have been made and the shooting remains under investigation, police said. Police are investigating other gunfire incidents, including a video circulating on social media of a man shooting into the air at Frankford and Cottman avenues, police said. A stabbing was also reported around 7:45 p.m. near Lincoln Financial Field, where the Eagles beat the Washington Commanders 55-23 and punched their ticket to the Super Bowl. A 25-year-old man was stabbed in the leg \"following a verbal altercation\" and was transported to an area hospital in stable condition, police said. The suspect -- identified by police as 34-year-old Tramayne Davis-Blockson -- was arrested at the scene and charged with aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime and recklessly endangering another person, police said. Several assaults against officers were reported on Sunday, including two who were working the NFC championship detail, police said.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Senate confirmed billionaire investorScott Bessenton Monday to serve as President Donald Trump’s treasury secretary, giving him the delicate balancing act of cutting taxes and curbing deficits while putting forward a plan on tariffs that doesn’t jeopardize growth. He was confirmed on a 68-to-29 vote, with 16 Democrats voting in favor of making him the nation’s 79th treasury secretary. The South Carolina resident will be the first openly gay individual in the role, a historic first as Trump seeks novel ways to implement a policy agenda driven by both billionaire business leaders with concerns over regulations and a populist base that wants government leaders to fight for them. Bessent, a past supporter of Democrats who once worked for George Soros, has become an enthusiastic supporter of Trump. He has said the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress does not renew key provisions of Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are set to expire Dec. 31, 2025. Negotiating the extension of those tax cuts will be one of his major responsibilities even as he has also pushed for 3% annual growth, significant trims to deficits and increasing domestic oil production by 3 million barrels a day. After Bessent was confirmed, Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said approving Bessent was “one of the easiest votes we could ever take.” However, he faced pushback from Democrats on unpaid tax liabilities.  Democrats say Bessent has engaged in tax avoidance by failing to pay nearly $1 million in Medicare taxes related to his limited partnership in his hedge fund. Bessent, meanwhile, takes issue with his tax liability to the IRS and is in litigation over the tax bill. He committed during his confirmation hearing that he would pay the tax bill if a court rules against him. Other Democrats have voiced support for Bessent, including Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. “While I disagree with many of his policy positions, particularly his support for extending tax cuts for the wealthy and President Trump’s tariff threats, I hope that he will focus the Treasury Department on bringing down costs for middle-class Americans,” Coons said in a statement, adding that he supports Bessent’s commitment to continue U.S. investment in international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Trumptook his time before settlingon Bessent as his nominee. He also mulled over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped for commerce secretary. The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president’s fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He is also a member of the president’s National Economic Council. Among his responsibilities will be investigating the feasibility ofcreating an External Revenue Serviceto collect tariff revenue from other nations. Trump announced the creation of the agency — which requires an act of Congress— on Truth Social earlier this month. Tariffs have become a benchmark of Trump’s economic agenda. He has threatened a potential 25% levy on all goods from allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China. In addition, Bessent faces a mounting and record U.S. debt load. Before leaving office this month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellenwarned congressional leadersthat Treasury would start taking “extraordinary measures,” or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hittingthe debt ceiling. And on Thursday, Treasury deployed such measures. With Trump’s return to the White House and his Republican Party controlling majorities in Congress, hisoutsider Cabinet choicesare getting confirmed despite initial skepticism and opposition from both sides of the aisle. In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining theIRS’ Direct File program— which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free — at least for the 2025 tax season, whichbegins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers say the program is a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular. He also said during his confirmation hearing that the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president’s influence and that U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.

(Andrew Esola via AP)       Within hours of taking office, President Donald Trump outlined in one of his many executive orders a mission to celebrate American greatness and to recognize those who have made contributions throughout history. He jumpstarted the effort by orderingthe name of North America’s tallest peakto be changed from Denali back to Mount McKinley in honor of the nation’s 25th president, William McKinley. He also called on the U.S. Interior Department to work with Alaska Natives and others to adopt names for other landmarks that would honor their history and culture. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names will play a role. The little known panel made up of officials from several federal agencies has been in existence since 1890. As more settlers and prospectors headed west following the American Civil War, it became apparent the federal government needed some kind of consistency for referencing landmarks on maps and in official documents. In comes President Benjamin Harrison. He issued an executive order establishing the board in hopes of resolving some of the confusion. President Theodore Roosevelt took it further in 1906, making the board responsible for standardizing geographic names for use across the federal government. That included changing names for some spots and identifying unnamed features. It was President Franklin Roosevelt who dissolved the board in 1934, opting instead to transfer duties to the Interior Department. After World War II, Congress changed course and reestablished the panel.  The board under the Trump administration will have new members, but the makeup will be the same with representatives from several agencies ranging from the Interior and Commerce departments to the Post Office and the Library of Congress. Even the CIA plays a role when the board considers place names beyond U.S. borders. The members are appointed for two-year terms by the respective heads of the agencies they represent. The committee that deals with names on U.S. soil meets monthly. The board is quite aware of the importance of a name, noting in its guidingprinciples, policies and proceduresthat the names of geographic features throughout the U.S. reflect the nation’s history and its changing face. The board points out that names of Native American origin are found sprinkled throughout the land and there are traces of the languages spoken by early explorers. “It is in these ways and many others that geographic naming gives us a clear, exciting profile of the United States that is unmatched in any other medium,” the board states. In the case of Mount McKinley, original inhabitants had unique names for the mountain long before prospectors showed up. For the Koyukon Athabaskans, it’s always been “deenaalee,” roughly translated as “the high one.” Despite never having visited Alaska, McKinley’s name became attached to the mountain in 1896, labeled by a gold prospector after the Republican was nominated as a presidential candidate. McKinley, who signed legislation in 1900 making gold the sole standard for U.S. currency, was assassinated just six months into his second term and the name Mount McKinley stuck. Alaska wasn’t a state then and it would take decades before elected officials there would petition the Board on Geographic Names to return to what locals knew best. But their efforts were repeatedly blocked. Then in 2015, after years of pressure from Alaska Natives and other advocates, President Barack Obamaissued an ordermaking Denali official for federal purposes. Like so many sites across the U.S., the peak is more than a tourist attraction. It’s woven into the cultural fabric of those who call the area home, said Valerie Grussing, executive director of the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers. “It’s a sacred place,” she told The Associated Press, adding, “the name we use for it should reflect that sacred relationship between the people and the land.” In the 1960s and 1970s, the Board on Geographic Names took action to eliminate the use of derogatory terms related to Japanese and Black people. More recently, former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland initiateda campaign to eliminate offensive namesat hundreds of places around the nation. She highlighted the work during her farewell address to department employees just weeks ago, saying theeffort to address derogatory wordswould continue. In 2023, the board voted to change Mount Evans southwest of Denver toMount Blue Skyat the request of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. Two years earlier, more than a dozen sites with racist and offensive names in Texas were renamed. In 2008, the board approved a proposal to change the name of a prominent Phoenix mountain to Piestewa Peak to honorArmy Spc. Lori Piestewa, the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military. And now there’s a campaign brewing in Alaska to have Denali restored. It’s too early to say whether that will result in a new proposal before the board. The Interior Department on Friday took steps to update the peak’s name in the federal Geographic Names Information System. Since the board’s decisions are binding only for the federal government,it’s possible Denali will live onthrough Google and Apple map applications and other private mapping services. Any person, government agency, Native American tribe or organization can submit a proposal to the board, as long as there is a compelling reason and evidence to support it. The support of local communities and historical or genealogical societies helps. “Because a name will affect many people for a long time, it should be acceptable to the community in which the feature is located and to federal departments and agencies, tribal, state and local governments, and other interested parties that have an interest in the feature,” board policy states. While its role over the years has grown, the board says its principles for deciding whose name may be applied to a natural feature for U.S. official maps and publications have stood the test of time. In some cases, the board may be able to suggest alternatives to geographic naming that might better commemorate an individual. The board prohibits consideration of any derogatory names and it won’t consider proposals involving the names of living people or anyone who has been dead less than five years. Once settled on, the names are listed in the official repository of geographic names used by the federal government. The system includes more than 2.5 million name records.

A frenzy over an artificial intelligence chatbot made by Chinese tech startup DeepSeek upended stock markets Monday, fueling debates over the economic and geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China in developing AI technology. The New York Stock Exchange is shown in New York’s Financial District on Dec. 31, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File)    NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s superstars tumbled Monday as a competitor from China threatens to upend theartificial-intelligencefrenzy they’ve beenfeastingon. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5%, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall forNvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, and they pulled the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% for its worst loss in more than a month. The damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289 points, or 0.7%, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes. The shock to financial markets came from China, where a company calledDeepSeekunveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the U.S. government hasrestricted Chinese accessto top AI chips. Tech stocks have the markets lower. More from AP business correspondent Seth Sutel. Skepticism, though, remains about how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that’s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrifyvast data centersgobbling up computing power. “It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.  DeepSeek’s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide. In Amsterdam, Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML slid 7%. In Tokyo, Japan’s Softbank Group Corp. lost 8.3% to pull closer to where it was before leaping on an announcementtrumpeted by the White Housethat it was joining apartnershipto invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure. And on Wall Street, Constellation Energy lost more than a fifth of its value, 20.8%. Thecompany has said it would restartthe shutteredThree Mile Island nuclear power plantto supply power for data centers for Microsoft. All the worries sent investors toward bonds, which can be safer investments than any stock. The rush pushed the yield of the 10-year Treasury down to 4.52% from 4.62% late Friday. It’s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast. Before Monday’s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash,Nvidia’sstock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example. It was just on Friday that Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg was saying he expects his company to invest up to $65 billion this year and grow its AI teams significantly, while talking up a data center in Louisiana that will be so large it could cover a significant part of Manhattan. A small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Their immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. That’s why many 401(k) holders felt the pain of Nvidia’s drop, even if they didn’t know they owned any Nvidia, so long as they owned a fund that tracks the S&P 500. All told, the S&P 500 fell 88.96 points to 6,012.28. The Nasdaq composite dropped 612.47 to 19,341.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 to 44,713.58. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, suggested not overreacting to Monday’s sharp swings. “It is possible that the news out of China could be overstated and then we could see a reversal of the recent market moves,” Jacobsen said. “It is also possible that the news is true, but then that would present new investment opportunities.” More big swings may be ahead. Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla are all on the schedule this upcoming week to report how much profit they made at the end of 2024. The pressure is on companies to keep delivering strong profits, particularly after arecent jump in Treasury yields. When bonds are paying more in interest, they put downward pressure on stock prices. Yields have been on the rise amid a solid U.S. economy and worries about possibly higher inflation coming fromtariffsand other policies favored by President Donald Trump. So far, big U.S. companies have been reporting better results than analysts expected. AT&T became the latest on Monday, and its stock rose 6.3%. In stock markets abroad, movements for broad indexes across Europe and Asia weren’t as forceful as for the big U.S. tech stocks. Stocks edged 0.1% lower in Shanghai after asurvey of manufacturersshowed export orders in China dropping to a five-month low. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

A frenzy over an artificial intelligence chatbot made by Chinese tech startup DeepSeek upended stock markets Monday, fueling debates over the economic and geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China in developing AI technology. A view of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Jan. 27, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)    News from Chinaupset U.S. marketsMonday and disrupted the frenzy that had built up around artificial intelligence. A company called DeepSeeksaid it had developed a large language model that can compete with U.S. AI giants but at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. Nvidia, Broadcom and Google’s parent company Alphabet were among the high-flying stocks that fell to earth, at least for now. The noise in the tech sector obscured some solid gains in other parts of the market. Here’s a look at DeepSeek’s impact on the financial markets, by the numbers: Monday’s decline in the S&P 500 tech sector, the biggest drop in the index since September 2020. Nvidia was one of eight stocks in the tech sector to post double-digit losses on the day. The decline for the index would have been worse if not for a gain of more than 3% in shares of Apple. The approximate decline in Nvidia’s market value. That decline is more than the combined market value of home improvement giants Home Depot and Lowe’s. Nvidia still carries a market value of about $2.9 trillion. The drop in Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s net worth after the selloff, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Ellison’s net worth jumped last week after President Donald Trump said a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank would spend up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to AI. Forbes says Ellison is still worth $200 billion. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, saw his net worth drop $20.8 billion to $103.6 billion.  The decline in Vistra Corp., the biggest drop for any stock in the S&P 500. Vistra isn’t a tech company — it’s an independent power producer. Its shares soared last year on expectations that the build out of AI infrastructure in the US. will require enormous amounts of power. The number of stocks in the S&P 500 that actually rose Monday. That the index dropped sharply on a day when better than three-fifths of its component stocks rose demonstrates the outsized influence of tech stocks such as Nvidia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has much less of an emphasis on tech than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, closed with a modest gain.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

Hong)                              LOS ANGELES (AP) — The first significant storm of the season brought snow and downpours to Southern California that doused wildfires and caused some ash and mud to flow across streets in the Los Angeles area on Monday. More than an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain fell in many areas, loosening Los Angeles hillsides burned bare by the recent blazenear the Pacific Palisadesneighborhood, where crews cleared inundated roadways including the famed Pacific Coast Highway. In neighboring Malibu, four schools were closed Monday “due to dangerous road conditions,” the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District said in a statement. Clouds were clearing, but flood watches from lingering pockets of rainwere still in effect forfire-scarred areas of the Palisades, Altadena and Castaic Lake. “All these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff,” said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service’s office for Los Angeles. AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports it’s been raining in wildfire damaged areas of Los Angeles. North of Los Angeles, snowy conditions late Sunday shut down the mountainous Tejon Pass section of Interstate 5, a key north-south artery for the state. It reopened Monday afternoon. The highway rises to more than 4,100 feet (1,250 meters) between LA and the San Joaquin Valley, making it susceptible to storm closures. Mountains across San Bernardino and Riverside counties were under a winter storm warning Monday and were forecast to get about a foot (0.30 meters) of snow from the storm. Chains were required for some vehicles heading to ski resorts in the Big Bear Lake area northeast of Los Angeles because of icy roads.  Parts of San Diego County received more than an inch of rain, while other areas got less. The rain began Saturday after months of dry and often gusty weather that created dangerous fire conditions. Los Angeles County crews spent much of last week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in areas devastated by thePalisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7. The Palisades Fire, the largest of the blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 12 people, reached 94% containment Monday. The Eaton Fire, which broke out near Altadena and has killed at least 17 people, was 98% contained. TheHughes Fire,which ignited north of Los Angeles last week and caused evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 people, was nearly contained. Downpours in San Diego County, helped firefighters make significant progress against the smaller Border 2 Fire churning through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. Los Angeles city and county officials last weekexpedited cleanup effortsand other measures aimed at mitigating the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants, and a White House statement on Friday said President Donald Trump has directed federal officials to help local authorities. Within five days of the order, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other departments “shall develop and execute a plan to expedite the bulk removal of contaminated and general debris,” the statement said. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones wasa toxic mixof incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from Los Angeles, wasravaged by mudslidesafter a downpour hit mountain slopes charred by a huge wildfire. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died. The rain ended a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Most of Southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought,” according to theU.S. Drought Monitor.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)         WASHINGTON (AP) — When Donald Trump took office in 2017 with promises to crack down on immigration, he was met bywidespread proteststhat filled churches, airports and union halls as Democratic lawmaker vowed to fight the new Republican president at every turn. The second time around, Democrats helpedsend an immigration billto his desk during his first week in office. Stinging from election losses, the Democratic Party has so far been splintered in responding to Trump’s push against illegal immigration. Yet the party’s soul searching comes as the stakes could hardly be higher.The new president is actingto seal off the U.S.-Mexico border border to asylum seekers and deport millions of immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. “I think Donald Trump has painted the Democratic Party into a corner on immigration, and it’s going to take us a while to get out of the corner,” said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. “I want us acting out of conviction about what we believe about immigration rather than out of fear.” On Capitol Hill, a crucial faction of Democrats are looking for places of agreement with Trump. Between the House and Senate, 58 Democrats last week voted to pass theLaken Riley Act, which requires federal authorities to detain migrants accused of theft, assaulting a police officer, or other crimes that injure or kill someone. Meanwhile, other congressional Democrats said they spent the last week addressing the fears and developing resources for those who could be deported. Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., joined a priest at Our Lady of Guadalupe church in San Diego last weekend, carrying the Eucharist from home to home because so many in the congregation feared to go outside. For Republicans, the votes on the Laken Riley Act were proof that they had found a winning message — amplified and led by Trump — on illegal immigration. They are planning to continue pushing immigration legislation, as well as a roughly $100 billion package that wouldenable Trump to carry outhis border and deportation plans. Democratic senators willing to back tougher enforcement could be crucial. It takes support from 60 senators to advance most legislation, meaning that at least a few Democrats will need to be on board. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. “It’s a really important moment for the country. And it’s always good when the right thing is also the popular thing,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., after the Laken Riley Act passed. It was named aftera Georgia nursing studentwho was killed last year by a Venezuelan man who had entered the United States illegally and was allowed to stay and to pursue his immigration case. When asked about Democratic votes for the legislation, the party’s leader in the House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, was circumspect. “House Democrats are going to continue to make decisions based on what’s right for the districts that we represent, and the politics will take care of themselves,” he said. Since last year, many Democrats havesteadily moved to the righton border security, emphasizing the need for stricter immigration enforcement afterhistoric numbers of migrantsarrived at times under Democrat Joe Biden’s presidency. Half of U.S. adults now think increasing security at the border should be a high priority for the federal government, according toa January pollfromThe Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Another 3 in 10 adults say it should be a moderate priority. While most Democrats oppose deporting all immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally, about 8 in 10 also favor deporting immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of a violent crime. The Biden administration prioritized for deportation those who posed a threat to national security. The Trump administration plans to go further by beginning its deportation operation with immigrants tied to crime. Sen. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat who last year won in Arizona while Trump also carried the state, was outspoken in his support for legislation such as the Laken Riley Act. He said that he’ was just reflecting the will of his constituents, including many Latino voters. “They want sane border security, commonsense solutions, more Border Patrol, more customs officers,” Gallego said. “They want to see bad people get deported. They want to see an opportunity for good people — to find a way for them to stay here.” Immigration advocates are frustrated by Democrats acquiescing to Trump’s tough border. They fear Trump can own the narrative around immigration. Vanessa Cárdenas, the executive director of America’s Voice advocacy group, acknowledged that it was a “tough moment” for Democrats. But, Cárdenas added, ”They need to find their backbone and put up a fight.” After the Laken Riley Act passed, leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a Democratic group that has usually played a key role in immigration policy, met with Jeffries as their party tried to formulate a united message. The group said it would focus on action to keep mixed-status families together, protect farmworkers and advocate for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Still, the group ranges from progressive members to those who voted for the new legislation. “We have to show we have the ability to build consensus internally,” New York Rep. Adriano Espaillat, chair of the Hispanic caucus, told The Associated Press. At a news conference the next day, Espaillat laid out the practical concerns of mass deportations, from forcing out immigrants who have contributed to the U.S. for decades to rising food prices if agricultural laborers are targeted. The event was intended to present a united front, yet as members of the caucus took turns at the microphone, their promises varied. “We are going to be here to fight back,” said Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y. Then Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M., spoke: “There are opportunities for us to work with Republicans, such as fighting the cartels and coyotes who traffic women and children, provide an endless supply of drugs and hurt our border communities.” Associated Press writer Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)      ▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump’s return to Washington BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The White House claimed victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S. on Sunday, hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner. Long close partners in anti-narcotics efforts, the U.S. and Colombia clashed Sunday over the deportation of migrants and imposed tariffs on each other’s goods in a show of what other countries could face if they intervene in theTrump administration’s crackdownon illegal immigration. The White House held up the episode as a warning to other nations who might seek to impede his plans. Earlier, the U.S. president had ordered visa restrictions, 25% tariffs on all Colombian incoming goods, which would be raised to 50% in one week, and other retaliatory measures sparked by President Gustavo Petro’s decision to reject two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants after Petro accusedTrumpof not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation. Petro also announced a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump said the measures were necessary because Petro’s decision “jeopardized” national security in the U.S. by blocking the deportation flights. “These measures are just the beginning,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.”  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a late Sunday statement that the “Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump’s terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.” Leavitt said the tariff orders will be “held in reserve, and not signed.” But Leavitt said Trump would maintain visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced customs inspections of goods from the country, “until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned.” The White House claimed victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S. on Sunday, hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner. The Colombian government late Sunday said it considered as “overcome” the episode with the Trump administration and Petro reposted the statement from the White House on X. “We have overcome the impasse with the United States government,” said Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo. “We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees, guaranteeing them decent conditions as citizens subject to rights.” Murillo added that the South American country’s presidential aircraft is available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes. Earlier Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was authorizing the visa restrictions on Colombian government officials and their families “who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations.” They were being imposed on top of the State Department’s move to suspend the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia’s capital, Bogota. Petro had said earlier that his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with “dignity.” Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet. “A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,” Petro said. “That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants... In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.” After Trump’s earlier tariff threat, Petro said in a post on X that he had ordered the “foreign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%.” Colombia has traditionally been the U.S.’s top ally in Latin America. But their relationship has strained since Petro, a former guerrilla, became Colombia’s first leftist president in 2022 and sought distance from the U.S. Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024. Colombia is also among the countries that last year began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama. The U.S. government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia. “This is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights,” a senior administration official told AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss issue publicly. Rubio in a statement said Petro “canceled his authorization” for the flights when the aircraft were in the air. Colombians emerged in recent years as a major presence on the U.S. border with Mexico, aided in part bya visa regimethat allows them to easily fly to Mexico and avoid trekking though the treacherous Darien Gap. They ranked fourth with 127,604 arrests for illegal crossings during a 12-month period through September, behind Mexicans, Guatemalans and Venezuelans. Mexico hasn’t imposed visa restrictions on Colombians, asthey have on Venezuelans, Ecuadoreans and Peruvians. Petro’s government in a statement later announced that the South American country’s presidential aircraft had been made available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes and guarantee them “dignified conditions.” As part of a flurry of actions to make good on Trump’s campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations. Two U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people. Colombia is the U.S.’s fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil, shipping about 209,000 barrels of oil per day last year, although booming domestic production has reduced the U.S.’ dependence on foreign oil. The South American country is also the U.S.’s largest supplier of fresh cut flowers. Regina Garcia Cano reported from Caracas, Venezuela, and Zeke Miller from Washington.

Many smiled, some hugged loved ones they hadn’t seen for months. Hundreds of thousands of Palestiniansfilled Gaza’s main coastal roadas they streamed back to homes in the north.  The mood was joyous, even though many knew their homes had been destroyed in Israeli offensives against Hamas thatleveled large parts of Gaza Cityand the surrounding north.  The important thing was to go back, they said, to prevent what many had feared would be a permanent expulsion from their homes.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)     “By returning, we are victorious,” said Rania Miqdad, who was heading back to Gaza City with her family.  Ismail Abu Mattar returned with his wife and four children to the ruins of their Gaza City home, which was partially destroyed by Israeli bombardment early in the war. Like many others whose houses are damaged, he planned to set up a tent nearby and start clearing the rubble.   “A tent here is better than a tent there,” he said, referring to the vast, squalid tent camps that arose in central and southern Gaza where he and much of the territory’s population have lived for months.  “We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors,” said Abu Mattar. His grandparents were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians driven from what is now Israelduring the 1948 war surrounding its creation.

(AP Photo/Abed Hajjar)       Under theceasefire dealbetween Israel and Hamas, Palestinians were allowed starting Monday to return north. U.N. officials estimated that some 200,000 people made their way back over the course of the day. The scenes of celebration were a sharp contrast to the misery and fear during the war as more than 1 million people fled south on the same routes to escape Israel’s assaults.  Associated Press photos, videos and drone footage showed huge crowds heading north on foot along Gaza’s main coastal road. On one side was the Mediterranean Sea; on the other stretched alandscape of destroyed buildings and bulldozed landleft behind by withdrawing Israeli forces. Armed Hamas fighters were visible in some spots, a sign of the militant group’s continued power in Gaza despite Israel’s vows to eliminate it.  Families carried bags of belongings and rolled up blankets. On their shoulders, men carried young children — or sacks of food and metal cannisters of cooking gas. Women balanced infants in their arms with satchels of clothes and jugs of water.  A little girl dressed in teddy-bear pajamas held her younger sister’s hand as they trailed their mother. A teenager strapped a pet carrier to his chest with his cat inside.  Others returned in cars and trucks piled high with mattresses and other belongings via a second route, Salah al-Din Road.  Many were smiling. A child waved a “V-for-victory” sign. People tearfully hugged relatives and friends they’d been separated from for months.  One old woman being pushed in a wheelchair sang a traditional Palestinian song of perseverance dating back to 1948.  “Stand by each other, people of Palestine, stand by each other. Palestine is gone, but it has not bid you a final farewell,” she sang with a smile on her face. Then she added, “Thank God, we’re returning to our homes, after suffering so much ruin and hunger and disease.” An aerial photograph taken by a drone shows displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip, following Israel’s decision to allow thousands of them to go back for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas, Monday, Jan. 27, 2025. (AP Photo/ Mohammad Abu Samra)       Those returning crossed through the Netzarim corridor, a swath of land bisecting the Gaza Strip that Israeli forces turned into a military zone to seal off the north. The north saw some of the most intense Israeli offensives, aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters operating in densely populated areas.  Throughout the war, Israel repeatedly ordered civilians to evacuate the north – for their safety, it said – but barred their return. Under the ceasefire’s terms, Israeli troops pulled back from the main routes to allow returns and are eventually to pull out completely from the corridor.  For some, the joy of return was blemished by the deaths of loved ones.  Kamal Hamadah was returning to Gaza City, where his eldest son, his daughter and her children were killed by bombardment early in the war. Their bodies were left buried under rubble in the streets, even as the rest of the family fled south, he said.  Then just over a month ago, another of his sons who fled with him was killed.  “When his mother learned we were going back home, she was struck by a great sadness that she was returning without the boy,” he said.  Returning home, Yasmin Abu Amshah had a happy reunion with her younger sister, Amany, who had stayed in Gaza City throughout the war. “I thought it wouldn’t happen, and we wouldn’t see each other again,” the 34-year-old mother of three said.  Her four-story building was damaged but not destroyed, so she and other members of her extended family will stay there.  Those returning face an uncertain future. If the ceasefire collapses, they could face new Israeli offensives. If peace lasts, it’s not clear when Palestinians will be able to rebuild homes, leaving much of the population in temporary housing.  Ibrahim Hammad, his wife and five children walked five hours back to their neighborhood in Gaza City – knowing their house there had been destroyed by an airstrike in December 2023. His family will stay at his brother’s house until he can clear a space in the ruins of his house to set up a tent.  “We had to return, even to the rubble,” the 48-year-old told the AP. “Here we don’t have a house, but our family is here, and we will help each other.”   Magdy reported from Cairo.

(Photo by Scott A Garfitt/Invision/AP, File)       NEW YORK (AP) — A New York judge set a March 2026 trial date on Monday and moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week as the public feud betweenBlake Livelyand her“It Ends With Us”costar and director Justin Baldoni continued to grow and accelerate. And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion. The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial. He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct. Liman took the actions after Lively’s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other. The lawyers said Baldoni’s attorney was trying to wreck Lively’s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni. The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was “engaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.”  They added: “The endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.” Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday’s assertions that the “irony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.” “We will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,” the lawyer said. “All we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.” In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the “objects of public scorn and contempt.” He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were “exiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively’s scorched-earth media campaign.” In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok. Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said. “He weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,” the filing alleges. Wallace is identified in Lively’s federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant. Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace’s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue. Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, “Deadpool” actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages. The judge said Monday that he’ll likely combine the lawsuits for trial. “It Ends With Us,” an adaptation ofColleen Hoover’s bestselling 2016 novelthat begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August,exceeding box office expectationswith a $50 million debut. But the movie’s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Lively came to fame through the 2005 film “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,” and bolstered her stardom on the TV series “Gossip Girl” from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including “The Town” and “The Shallows.” Baldoni starred in the TV comedy“Jane the Virgin,”directed the 2019 film “Five Feet Apart” and wrote “Man Enough,” a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.

As afragile ceasefireheld into a second week, Israel was told by Hamas that eight of the hostages to be freed during the deal’s first phase are dead.  Joyous crowdsof Palestinians, some holding babies or pushing wheelchairs, walked along a seaside road all day and into the night, carrying bedrolls, bottles of water and other belongings. Armed and masked Hamas fighters flashed a victory sign. The crowd was watched over by Israeli tanks on a nearby hill.

The United Nations said over 200,000 people were observed moving north on Monday morning.  Palestinians who have been shelteringin squalid tent campsand former schools are eager to return to their homes — even thoughthey are likely damaged or destroyed. Many had feared that Israel wouldmake their displacement permanent.     Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her damaged but habitable Gaza City home. She saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year.  “It was a long trip, but a happy one,” she said. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on the return of Palestinians to their homes in devastated Northern Gaza, after Israel lifted a long-time blockade there following a ceasefire deal with Hamas.  Many saw their return as an act of steadfastness after Israel’s military campaign, which was launched in response to the Hamas militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The return was also seen as a repudiation of U.S.President Donald Trump’s suggestionthat many Palestinians be resettled in Egypt and Jordan. Both countries rejected the idea.

(AP Photo/Mahmoud illean)       Whether hostages are still alive inside Gaza has been a heartbreaking question for waiting families who have pushed Israel’s government to reach a deal to free them, fearing that time was running out.  Before Monday’s announcement, Israel believed that at least 35 of the about 90 hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack and still in Gaza were dead.  Government spokesman David Mencer told journalists that a list received overnight from Hamas on the status of the 33 hostages being freed under the ceasefire’s first phase showed eight were dead.  The families have been informed, he said, adding that the information matched what Israeli intelligence had believed.  The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 assault and abducted another 250.  Israel responded with an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.  In all, around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced, and they facenew health risksas they return.

(AP Photo/Abed Hajjar)       Ismail Abu Mattar, a father of four who waited for days near the crossing point for northern Gaza, described scenes of jubilation, with people singing, praying and crying.  “It’s the joy of return,” said Abu Mattar, whose relatives were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. “We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.”  In the war’s opening days, Israel ordered the evacuation of the north and sealed it off after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled south while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting andthe worst destruction.  The opening to the north was delayed for two days as Israel said Hamas had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Local medical officials said Israeli forces opened fire at the waiting crowd and killed several Palestinians over the weekend. Israel’s military said it fired warning shots at approaching groups it deemed a threat.  Mediatorsresolved the dispute overnight. Hamas called the return “a victory for our people.”  Later Monday in central Gaza, Awda hospital said it received the body of a child killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp when returnees were hit, and three others were wounded. It said three more were wounded in a separate attack near the camp.

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)   Israel’s military said one of its aircraft fired “to distance a number of suspicious vehicles” moving north in unauthorized areas. And it said it fired shots in northern Gaza to “remove” someone it deemed a threat who didn’t move away.    Palestinians were crossing on foot without inspection through part ofthe Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles opened later on Gaza’s main north-south highway, where traffic was backed up for around 3 kilometers (2 miles).  Under the ceasefire agreement, vehicles are to be inspected for weapons before entering the north.  An Egyptian official said Egyptian contractors, along with a U.S. firm, run checkpoints that inspect vehicles heading via Salahuddin road. The contractors are part of an Egyptian-Qatari committee implementing the ceasefire, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The contractors are cleared by Israel.  Israel had delayed the crossing’s opening, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. Israel said she should have been released before four female soldiers who werefreed on Saturday.  Qatar, a key mediator, announced early Monday that Yehoud and two other hostages would be released by Friday. Israel said the release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. Another three hostages should be released on Saturday as previously planned.  There were mixed emotions among Israelis watching the scene in Gaza from the nearby city of Sderot. Some expressed mistrust toward the Palestinians. Others were empathetic.  “Let them come back home safely and conduct a normal life,” said one, Rachel Osher. “We also want it. We want the same on both sides of the border.”   Shurafa and Hana reported from Wadi Gaza, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) NEW YORK (AP) — One of Neil Gaiman’s publishers has dropped him as theBritish authorfaces multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment. And his name is not on the website of the agency which has for years handled his speaking appearances. Dark Horse Comicsannounced on X last weekend that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman’s novel, “Anansi Boys.” The seventh of eight planned editions came out earlier this month. “Dark Horse takes seriously the allegations against Neil Gaiman and we are no longer publishing his works,” reads the statement from Dark Horse, which still includes Gaiman’s books on its website. Allegations against Gaiman, known for such bestsellers as “Coraline” and “The Sandman” series, first emerged last summer on a Tortoise Media podcast. After a lengthy New York Magazine article in January included allegations from eight women of assault, abuse and coercion, Gaiman responded with a blog post,denying any wrongdoing. “Like most of us, I’m learning, and I’m trying to do the work needed, and I know that that’s not an overnight process,” he wrote. “At the same time, as I reflect on my past – and as I re-review everything that actually happened as opposed to what is being alleged – I don’t accept there was any abuse.” Gaiman’s office and his literary agent did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.  Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment. Gaiman still lists the Stephen Barclay Agency onhis websiteas a contact for personal appearances, but his name doesn’t appear on theagency’s client list.Barclay did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Disney has paused a planned adaptation of Gaiman’s “The Graveyard Book,” while Netflix is still scheduled to release a second season based on “The Sandman.”   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)          DORAL, Fla. (AP) —President Donald Trumpregaled House Republicans on Monday with a rhetorical highlight reel from his first week in office, and he urged them to support his immigration crackdown and border security proposals. “We have no apologies and we’re moving very fast,” Trump said. “I really focus on the border more than anything else,” he said,downplaying the importance of inflation, an issue that fueled his candidacy last year but one that he has less control over as president. Speaking at House Republicans’ annual policy retreat, Trump made clear his political ambitions as he rallied lawmakers to advance their conservative agenda. “We’re forging a new political majority that’s shattering and replacing Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition, which dominated American politics for over 100 years,” he said. The conference is being held at Trump National Doral Miami, a posh resort with four golf courses owned by the billionaire president. Although Republicans are euphoric over election victories that have given them total control in Washington, they’re also facing difficult negotiations in the coming weeks and months. They need to find consensus on a spending bill before a March 14 deadline, when funding for the federal government expires. In addition, Republicans are working on a budget blueprint that would set the stage for their broader plans, including tax cuts, fossil fuel development and border security. With thin majorities in the House and Senate, they will need near-unanimity to pass their proposals without Democratic support.  Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, set the first week of February for the House Budget Committee to pass the blueprint that is key to the whole process. “That will be where the lion’s share of these campaign promises we made are fulfilled,” Johnson said. “And that’s what all the hard work here is, in the room with all of us negotiating and coming to consensus.” Political capital is almost always at its peak at the start of a new presidential term, even more so because this is Trump’s second and he is prevented under the Constitution from a third. However, that didn’t stop Trump from joking Monday about running again. “I think I’m not allowed to run again,” Trump said as he turned to Johnson. “Am I allowed to run again, Mike?” Johnson is trying to lump many of the Republican priorities into one massive catch-all bill that Senate Democrats cannot filibuster, but many Republican senators think it would be better to do two bills — the first focused on border security and defense, and the second on extending and expanding upon the tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term. “Whether it’s one bill, two bills, I don’t care,” Trump said in Doral. Republicans are also eyeing potential changes to key safety net programs, such as work requirements for those participating in Medicaid, to help offset the cost of enacting their priorities. Trump has pushed expensive ideas like exempting tipped wages and Social Security checks from income taxes. House Republicans said they expect more specifics to be announced after the retreat in Doral. Until then, they were highlighting Trump’s first week in office, particularly reveling in theshowdownTrump had with Colombia this past weekend over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Colombia agreed to all of Trump’s terms, “including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.” “Think about it, President Trump, I don’t even think had finished the front nine before he successfully forced the Colombian president to take back their illegal immigrants,” said Rep.Lisa McClain, R-Mich. “The days of America being walked all over are long gone thanks to President Trump.” On the budget fight to come, Democrats are already casting it as one that would primarily benefit the wealthy at the expense of others, with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries labeling the Republican effort a “contract against America.” “It will hurt working families, hurt the middle class, hurt our children, hurt our seniors and hurt our veterans,” Jeffries said. Republicans are warning that if Congress does not act quickly to extend tax relief, capital will remain on the sidelines and families next year would see child tax credits and a guaranteed tax deduction greatly reduced, upping their federal tax bill. One of Trump’s parting admonitions to lawmakers in the room was to stick together because “we have a chance to win like never before.” “There’s nothing we cannot achieve as long as the Republican Party remains united. I hope you can remain united,” Trump said.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

Still circling Earth, Firefly Aerospace’s lunar lander fired its thrusters Thursday to put it on a path to reach the moon in over a month. Dubbed Blue Ghost, the spacecraft beamed back photos and video of the Blue Marble, our planet. The Texas company released the images Friday. It carries experiments for NASA, part of the space agency’s effort toreturn astronauts to the moonthis decade. Blue Ghost is one of two lunar landers launched from Florida by SpaceX on Jan. 15. It’s targeting a moon touchdown on March 2. The other lander is sponsored by the Japanese company ispace and taking an even longer route, with a landing in late May or early June. It’s the first moonshot for Firefly and the second for ispace, whichcrashed its first landerinto the moon in 2023.

        "content": "Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. In this photo provided by Pasadena, Calif., resident Matt Logelin, flames burn beneath transmission towers owned by Southern California Edison in Eaton Canyon in the early evening of Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2025. (Matt Logelin via AP) GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) — Southern California Edison on Monday reported a fault on a power line connected miles away from ones located near the origin of the Eaton Fire, the deadly blaze that ignited outside of Los Angeles on Jan. 7 and killed at least 17 people. Edison says that there is still no evidence that its equipment caused the blaze, which has destroyed more than 9,000 structures in and around the community of Altadena. The official investigation into the fire’s cause has not been completed. The utility’s new filing with the California Public Utilities Commission comes on the same day as a court hearing ina casefiled by attorneys for a homeowner whose property was destroyed in the fire. The attorneys allege the utility’s equipment sparked the fire, pointing to video taken during the fire’s early minutes that shows large flames beneath electrical towers. The attorneys have now introduced new video they say shows arcing and electrical sparking on a transmission tower in Eaton Canyon just before the wind whipped the fire into a fast-moving and destructive blaze. They say the video came from security footage of a gas station. The Eaton Fire was one of two massive and deadly blazes that sparked on Jan. 7 amid hurricane-force winds that whipped across the parched Los Angeles region. At least 28 people have died and firefighters have continued battling the blazes for weeks. The Eaton Fire is now nearly contained, meaning firefighters almost have it surrounded, as the region gets its first rain in months.  In its new filing, Edison reported that the fault occurred at 6:11 p.m. While those lines that experienced the fault do not traverse Eaton Canyon, they are connected to the system, which did experience a surge, the utility reported. “Preliminary analysis shows that, because SCE’s transmission system is networked, the fault on this geographically distant line caused a momentary and expected increase in current on SCE’s transmission system, including on the four energized lines (in the fire area),” SCE’s filing said. “The current increase remained within the design limits and operating criteria for these circuits and, as intended, did not trigger system protection on these lines.” Attorneys for Altadena resident Evangeline Iglesias argued that, together, the fault and gas station video provide “evidence that SCE’s equipment in Eaton Canyon was the source of the initial ignition, and there is a near-certainty that physical evidence of the cause exists somewhere along the SCE transmission lines that run parallel to the line on the tower that erupted in flame.” Video and photos taken by residents also captured flames beneath Edison’s electrical towers in the Eaton Canyon area in the early minutes of the fire. One resident said he heard a loud pop at the outset of the conflagration. Kathleen Dunleavy, a spokesperson for Southern California Edison, said the company received the footage of the gas station video from The New York Times on Saturday night and contacted authorities to ensure they had the video as well. She said it was premature for them to comment on the footage as experts investigated what caused the blaze. “As of today, January 26, no one knows what caused the Eaton Fire,” Dunleavy said in an email Sunday. “Our investigation is ongoing, and we will continue our longstanding commitment to transparency.” Iglesias’ attorneys have accused the utility ofdestroying evidence. A judge last week ordered Edison to preserve evidence in the area, concerned that the utility is discarding equipment that may hold clues to the fire’s origin. SCE’s attorneys say the company has preserved evidence in the area where the fire originated as its crews work to restore power to about 2,000 homes in Altadena that are still dark. In an earlier filing to the CPUC, Edison reported two days after the fire started that it had not received any suggestions that its equipment was involved in the ignition. “Preliminary analysis by SCE of electrical circuit information for the energized transmission lines going through the area for 12 hours prior to the reported start time of the fire shows no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire,” the utility reported. This assertion was repeated in the utility’s Monday filing.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)           LOS ANGELES (AP) —Beyoncéleads the 2025 Grammys nominee pack, but Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Charli xcx are vying for their moment in the spotlight. Beyoncé is up for 11 awards thanks to “Cowboy Carter,” tying Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” record for most nominations for a single album.” She’s also the most awarded artist in Grammys’ history. Is itfinally her timeto take home the top prize? If she wins the album of the year, she’ll become the first Black woman to do so in the 21st century. Who else will be victorious, earningthose gramophone-shaped trophieson Sunday? The Associated Press’ Maria Sherman and Jonathan Landrum Jr. break down the close races for Grammy glory. “New Blue Sun,” André 3000; “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé; “Short n’ Sweet,” Sabrina Carpenter; “BRAT,” Charli xcx; “Djesse Vol. 4, “Jacob Collier; “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” Billie Eilish; “Chappell Roan The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” Chappell Roan; “The Tortured Poets Department,” Taylor Swift SHERMAN: I’ve got my gloves on, let the boxing begin. The album of the year category is stacked with some of the biggest pop releases in recent history.Jacob Collierfeels like a long shot; in some ways, so does André 3000, though it would be great for acompletely instrumental, alt-jazz albumtake home the top prize. He’s won before, with Outkast, for 2004’s “Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.” My money is on Beyoncé. She leads the nominations this year. And while “Cowboy Carter” is a masterclass in reclamation, a necessary work that existsin opposition to country music’s rigid power structures, it is not her best album. But her AOTY trophy is long overdue. (Lest we forget the “Lemonade” snub, AP’s pick forbest album of the last decade.)She’s the most awarded artist in Grammy history and has never won the top prize. Let’s fix that!  LANDRUM: Hope you’ve got a good corner, because I don’t pull punches. Sure, this category is stacked, but there’s only one who stands tall: Beyoncé’s “Cowboy Carter.” Her win shouldn’t be about past snubs. It’s about the fact that she delivered the best overall project. Period. Beyoncé dove into country music headfirst, shining a spotlight on Black country acts like Shaboozey, Brittney Spencer and Tiera Kennedy while redefining the genre’s possibilities. Eilish’s “Hit Me Hard and Soft” is incredible and well-deserving of a win here. But Beyoncé didn’t just make history by becoming the first Black woman to top Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart in 80 years, she owned this high risk, high reward opportunity. If this doesn’t lead to Beyonce’s first album of the year win, then voters clearly missed the memo. “Now and Then,” the Beatles; “Texas Hold ’Em,” Beyoncé; “Espresso,” Sabrina Carpenter; “360,” Charli xcx; “Birds of a Feather,” Billie Eilish; “Not Like Us,” Kendrick Lamar; “Good Luck, Babe!”, Chappell Roan; “Fortnight,” Taylor Swift featuring Post Malone SHERMAN: Beyoncé has never won in this category, but I think her big win will be for album of the year. The Beatles have also never won record of the year. But giving them the prize in 2024 would be less forthe AI-assisted track,and more for the fact that we’re talking about a new Beatles song. Lamar deserves to win, but we all know the Grammys love Eilish… I think it is hers to lose. LANDRUM: The Grammys love handing out trophies to Eilish and Lamar — 17 for him, nine for her. Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” is an infectious, breezy melody, no doubt. But “Not Like Us” should win. Why? This was a game-changing track where Lamar delivered the final knockout blow during an epic rap beef to Drake, following a string of power punches from hits like “Like That,” “Euphoria,” and “6:16 in LA.” And who could forget when Lamar performed the song five times in a row at hisJuneteenth “Pop Out” concertlast summer? That was a mic drop moment for the culture. “Not Like Us” has become a daily affirmation for many(well, maybe not Drake).It’s the kind of track that’s so impactful you almost hope Lamar performs it multiple times during his upcomingSuper Bowl halftime show performance. Will that happen? Probably not. But hey, a brotha can dream, right? Much respect to the other nominees, but “Not Like Us” deserves to win, proving once and for all that nothing else even came close. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)\"; “Birds of a Feather\"; “Die with a Smile”; “Fortnight”; “Good Luck, Babe!\"; “Not Like Us\"; “Please Please Please\"; “Texas Hold ’Em.” See the full list ofsongwriters here. LANDRUM: Picture this: the presenter opens the envelope and announces, “‘Not Like Us’ by Kendrick Lamar,” as the crowd erupts in cheers. They can’t resist reciting the chorus: “They not like us, they not like us, they not us!” It’s not far-fetched to imagine this happening. Lamar’s pen was as lethal as ever on this track. Just ask Drake. With Lamar as the track’s sole songwriter, this feels like the perfect moment for him to finally snag his first win in this category. SHERMAN: If there’s any justice in this world, you’re correct! And it is about time Lamar earns a trophy in a top four category. Benson Boone; Sabrina Carpenter; Doechii;Khruangbin;RAYE;Chappell Roan;Shaboozey;Teddy Swims SHERMAN: Last yearwe were agreementthat Victoria Monét would win best new artist, and then she did. Will lightning strike twice? There’s no shortage of deserving talent here, but I think it will come down to Carpenter and Roan.Shaboozey is an innovatorbut his song eclipsed his album; Doechii’s mainstream rise to fame arrived too late in the year. Between the two pop ladies, I’d love for it to go to Roan — who feels like a breath of fresh air in music’s mainstream. However, I think it will go to Carpenter, despite the fact that she is on her sixth album. LANDRUM: I think we’re both in agreement: This is Carpenter’s category to lose. But let’s be real. Crowning a best new artist who’s ontheir sixth albumfeels off. It’s like letting a sixth-year college football player compete against freshmen and sophomores. Sure, they’re technically eligible, but it doesn’t quite sit right. They should be competing in the pros. Still,rules are rules, and here we are. Carpenter might win, but it’s hard not to question if this “new artist” title hits a little differently. Maybe it needs to be tweaked. “Bodyguard,” Beyoncé; “Espresso,” Sabrina Carpenter; “Apple,” Charli xcx; “Birds of a Feather,” Billie Eilish; “Good Luck, Babe!”, Chappell Roan SHERMAN: First things first — it is exciting to see an all-woman lineup and it comes as no surprise: they’redominating streaming growthin the U.S. Something tells me this will go to Sabrina Carpenter for her summertime-and-then-some smash, “Espresso.” LANDRUM: In this all-women category, I see Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather” soaring to victory. “Enough (Miami),” Cardi B; “When the Sun Shines Again,” Common and Pete Rock featuring Psdnuos; “Nissan Altima,” Doechii; “Houdini,” Eminem; “Like That,” Future and Metro Boomin featuring Kendrick Lamar; “Yeah Glo!”, GloRilla; “Not Like Us,” Kendrick Lamar LANDRUM: There are some big names in this category, but none of the nominees are quite like Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” The only real challenger? Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That,” which, um, features Lamar himself. Either way, Lamar takes the win. SHERMAN: It is Lamar’s, no question about it. “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé; “F-1 Trillion,” Post Malone; “Deeper Well,” Kacey Musgraves; “Higher,” Chris Stapleton; “Whirlwind,” Lainey Wilson SHERMAN: A few things can be true at once: I believe, in my heart of hearts,Post Malonemay earn his first Grammy at the 2025 award show. I believe Beyoncé will win album of the year for “Cowboy Carter.” But when it comes to the best country album category – and the namesChris StapletonandLainey Wilsonare included – it’s hard for me to imagine they’d lose, given the Grammys’ track record. LANDRUM: If Beyoncé doesn’t win best country album, how can she possibly take home album of the year? Shrugs. Make it make sense. A loss in this category would feel like a tell-all sign for how the evening might play out for Beyoncé ahead of the ceremony’s top honor. In my humble opinion, crowning Stapleton — or any other artist — over Beyoncé in this category wouldn’t make sense, especially since she’s the only nominee in this category that’s up for album of the year. Plus, her culturally groundbreaking album isn’t just a genre-defying masterpiece; it’s a cultural moment that should rightfully dominate the night. Voters have made some questionable calls in the past. But if justice prevails, Queen Bey should be leaving with this country music crown. “11:11 (Deluxe),” Chris Brown; “Vantablack,” Lalah Hathaway; “Revenge,” Muni Long; “Algorithm,” Lucky Daye; “Coming Home,” Usher LANDRUM: Did you know it’s been a decade sinceUsherlast took home a Grammy? 2015 to be exact. I think Usher’s Grammy-winning drought finally comes to an end with his “Coming Home” album. That said, don’t sleep onMuni Long’s “Revenge,”which could sneak in and steal the spotlight. SHERMAN: I often find that Grammy voters award an artist fortheir very big years.After strategically dropping the great “Coming Home” ahead of his Super Bowl performance and following it up with a tour after his super popular Vegas residency, how could it not go to Usher? “BRAT,” Charli xcx; “Three,” Four Tet; “Hyperdrama,” Justice; “Timeless,” KAYTRANADA; “Telos,” Zedd SHERMAN:Charli xcx’s “BRAT”was more than an album, it was a zeitgeist-shifting movement where the rules are have fun, be messy, go to a rave and embrace a vomit-y chartreuse color. Right? I believe she will win her first Grammy at this year’s show, and I believe at least one of them will be for best dance/electronic album – unless, of course, the Justice fans emerge out of the woodwork. LANDRUM: This feels like “BRAT” is destined to win, especially since it’s the only project in this category also up for album of the year. However, if Beyoncé could potentially lose best country album, then anything’s possible including KAYTRANADA’s “Timeless” pulling off the upset. Both projects are on par with each other, and KAYTRANADA along with Justice have triumphed in this category before. But it just feels like the stars are aligning for Charli xcx to take this one. “Funk Generation,” Anitta; “El Viaje,” Luis Fonsi; “GARCÍA,” Kany García; “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,” Shakira; “ORQUÍDEAS,” Kali Uchis SHERMAN: While música Mexicana continues to grow globally (and that category will likely see another win from Peso Pluma — or maybeCarin Leónfor his hooky “Boca Chueca, Vol. 1”) I wanted to talk through the Latin pop album category, because I think there’s some potential for competition here. Kali Uchis’ “ORQUÍDEAS” was not only one ofAP’s picks for best of 2024,but it was also met with wide-spread acclaim. Could Recording Academy members agree? Kany García won a few trophies at the 2024 Latin Grammys, but my money is on Shakira’s“Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran.”It is her first new album in seven years, and I think she will be awarded accordingly. LANDRUM: Shakira might have a strong shot at taking this category, but my money’s on“ORQUIDEAS.”With out-of-this-world production, Uchis effortlessly switches between Spanish and English, taking listeners on a journey that flows from melodic vibes to full-on dance floor energy. It’s the perfect fusion, and the ultimate recipe for a win. The 67th Grammy Awards will be held Sunday at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. The show will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File) Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler walks on the court after an NBA basketball game against the San Antonio Spurs, Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025, in Miami. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)     MIAMI (AP) — Jimmy Butler was back from suspension. Again. And then Butler got suspended by the Miami Heat. Again. Butler has been suspended for the third time this month by the Heat, this one starting basically just as the second one was ending. The team said that Butler left Monday’s morning shootaround practice early, in advance of a game against the Orlando Magic — something the team called “intentionally withholding services.” The suspension is without pay and indefinite for now, with the team saying it will last at least five games. Butler was expected to come back from his second suspension on Monday — only to be suspended for a third time. Butler, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, was told during the shootaround that he was not going to be back in the starting lineup for that night’s game against Orlando. He left the shootaround not long afterward, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team did not release that detail publicly. “The Miami Heat are suspending Jimmy Butler without pay effective immediately for an indefinite period to last no fewer than five games,” read the team statement. “The suspension is due to a continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services. This includes walking out of practice earlier today.” Butler was suspended for Miami’s most recent two gamesafter missing a team flight to Milwaukee last week.  Butler had missed14 of Miami’s last 19 games entering Monday, including nine of the last 12 because of the suspensions —the first a seven-game banforconduct that the team deemed detrimental,followed by the two-game suspension. Butler’s role going forward — starter or non-starter — was in some question even before the latest suspension was announced. Butler hasn’t come off the bench in a game since Jan. 27, 2017, exactly eight years ago Monday in a game against Miami, ironically, when he and then-Chicago teammate Dwyane Wade criticized how the Bulls were playing. Including playoffs, Butler has started in each of his last 560 appearances. “It kind of feels normal now at this point,” Heat guard Tyler Herro said at the morning shootaround when asked what it’s like to have Butler available again after a suspension — those words coming a few hours before the latest suspension was announced. “Kind of is what it is, but nothing’s guaranteed. We’ve just got to be ready to roll with whatever cards we’re dealt tonight. We’ve just got to be ready to go.” Butler wants a trade, and Miami is trying to comply.But moving Butler and his $48.8 million salary this season is likely going to be more complicated that it would have been in past seasons, largely because of the league’s aprons — salary levels installed as part of the new collective bargaining agreement that restrict the ways bigger-spending teams can make certain moves. It has been a sagathat has lasted nowfor nearly two monthsand figures to come to a head — one way or another — over the next week and a half. The NBA’s trade deadline is Feb. 6, which meant the game against Orlando could have been one of the final times Butler plays a home game in Miami. Counting the Magic game, there are only six games left for Miami before the trade deadline, raising the possibility that Butler will not play for the team again. “We didn’t talk about anything today other than preparing for the Magic. ... We’re just focusing on the task at hand,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “There’s no better place to be than just the present moment.” The Heat next play at home on Wednesday against Cleveland. After that, they leave for a four-game trip to San Antonio, Chicago, Philadelphia and Brooklyn — that Nets game getting played on Feb. 7, one day after the deadline. Butler has said repeatedly throughout this process that he still loves Miami, in the off-the-court sense. “I love this city with everything that I have,” he said this weekend while appearing at a padel tournament that he co-chaired. The issue, for him, is with the team. Butler became eligible last summer for a two-year, $113 million extension that the Heat have not offered him.Heat president Pat Riley said after last seasonthat the team had reservations about such a deal since Butler has missed about one of every four Miami games since he joined the team. Butler entered the seasonsaying he was not upset about the extension not getting done. It appears that stance changed in recent weeks, and the team announced earlier this month that Butler asked for a trade — something he cannot do publicly by league rule. Butler is averaging 17 points this season. He had one of the best statistical games in Heat history against Detroit on Dec. 16 — 35 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists. In six appearances entering Monday since then, including one in which he departed in the first quarter with an illness, Butler is averaging 9.5 points, 2.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists. He has also lost at least $3 million in salary — and counting, since this latest suspension is also without pay — since then because of the suspensions. The National Basketball Players Association has said it plans to appeal the first suspension, which means Butler could get some money back.

The former Beatle has dabbled in the music ever since singing the country hit “Act Naturally” with the Beatles in 1965, and he’s now about to release a whole country album. Starr says in an interview with The Associated Press’ Andrew Dalton that he’s put a bit of country in most everything he’s done, so the album wasn’t too big a stretch. Starr says the project began when he bumped into his friend, classic country aficionado T-Bone Burnett, and asked him to write a song. Burnett came back with nine.

Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Trap.” Hartnett is now 46 and lives in England with his wife and four children. While he’s been working steadily since breaking out in 1998 with a “Halloween” sequel and “The Faculty,” he intentionally moved away from studio movies and leading man roles after being typecast as his fame grew with movies like “Black Hawk Down” and “Pearl Harbor.” In “Trap,” Hartnett plays a father with a secret who takes his daughter to a pop concert — which is surrounded by police searching for a serial killer.  M. Night Shyamalan has been at least partly self-financing his films since 2015’s “The Visit,” risking his own money on box office success. His latest is “Trap,” starring Josh Hartnett as a father with a secret and Shyamalan’s daughter Saleka as a pop star whose concert is surrounded by police looking to capture a serial killer. Shyamalan spoke with AP entertainment editor Ryan Pearson about his high-risk, high-reward, lower-budget filmmaking approach, guiding his daughters’ artistic pursuits — and his philosophy that “talent is process.”  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)                   FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Brian Schottenheimer carried a card in his wallet when he was still in college, inscribed with his goal at the time. Become the youngest head coach in the NFL. Didn’t quite work out that way for theson of the late coach Marty Schottenheimer, in part because he said it wasn’t too many years later when the younger Schottenheimer thought maybe he wasn’t ready. The 51-year-old Schottenheimer says he is now, and the Dallas Cowboys promoted him from offensive coordinator to be the 10th coach in the storied franchise’s history. “I thought for a while it might not happen, but it’s been a lifelong dream,” Schottenheimer said at his introductory news conference Monday, with his family and Marty Schottenheimer’s widow, Pat, watching along with franchise quarterback Dak Prescott and several teammates. “That notecard was in my wallet at an early age, and it’s been a long time coming, but it’s here,” the younger Schottenheimer said. He was quick to address the skeptics who questioned the hiring of a coach considered a career assistant, a suggestion even dropped by owner Jerry Jones when he announced the decision last week. Schottenheimer broached the touchy subject even before taking a moment to recognize his father, who was 200-126-1 in 21 seasons as a head coach with stops in Cleveland, Kansas City, Washington and San Diego. The elder Schottenheimer died four years ago at age 77.  “I’ve had some opportunities when I was a much younger man, that I didn’t feel like I was ready,” Brian Schottenheimer said. “I’m ready now. I know what I want. I know what it looks like.” The Cowboys promoted him less than two weeks afterparting ways with Mike McCarthy, who brought Schottenheimer in as a consultant in 2022 and was on an expiring contract after a 7-10 season. Schottenheimer was the offensive coordinator the past two seasons with McCarthy calling plays. The Dallas front office was in discussions to keep McCarthy before both sides decided to move on. Executive vice president of personnel Stephen Jones said Schottenheimer would have left the staff had McCarthy stayed because he wanted to pursue play-calling opportunities. Talk of Schottenheimer staying and calling plays morphed into conversations about him being head coach. He plans to call plays, too. Schottenheimer was an assistant with the St. Louis Rams, Kansas City, Washington, the San Diego Chargers and Jacksonville along with three one-year stops in college. His 14 years as an offensive coordinator include six with the Jets, three with the Rams and Seahawks and two with the Cowboys. “How often do you have someone that has 25 ... years of working through the human relationship and working, aspiring to learn or have his ears and eyes wide open and looking for techniques and looking for things that make coaches better,” Jerry Jones said. “He’s had 25 years being around the kinds of things that he’s going to have to draw on to be a coach of the Dallas Cowboys.” Schottenheimer said his first chance to consider head coaching came during his first stint as an NFL play-caller, from 2006-11 with the New York Jets. He said he had “pause,” and a three-year run as Pete Carroll’s offensive coordinator with the Seattle Seahawks almost a decade later played a big role in him believing he could be a head coach, in part from the challenges Carroll presented him. Jones spent more than 10 minutes answering the first question of the news conference, defending the hire and bristling over the suggestion that it was a conversative move by picking a coach on the existing staff. “Without this thing being about me in any way, if you don’t think I can’t operate out of my comfort zone, you’re so wrong,” Jones said. “It’s unbelievable. This is as big a risk as you can take, as big a risk as you could take. No head coaching experience.” Schottenheimer is the 10th coach in franchise history, and the ninth hired by Jones since be bought the team in 1989 and fired the only coach from Dallas’ first 29 seasons, Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Landry. It’s the seventh coach since the last time the Cowboys reached an NFC championship game, on the way to their fifth Super Bowl title in 1995. It’s the longest drought in the NFC without reaching the conference title game. The Cowboys went to the playoffs three consecutive years with 12-5 records under McCarthy but were 1-3 in the postseason. Asked how things would be different, Schottenheimer spoke extensively about building relationships. “This business has never been about X’s and O’s,” Schottenheimer said. “It’s about people.” And the Cowboys believe they found the right person, even if McCarthy was the one who brought him here. McCarthy’s NFL coaching career started under Marty Schottenheimer in 1993. “Would he do things different, is he going to do things different than Mike? Absolutely,” Stephen Jones said. “I think we’ve got a great plan on defense. I think we’ve got a great plan on special teams. We’re putting that all together. That has to come together as a staff, and certainly Schotty leads that.” Perhaps the biggest thing working Schottenheimer’s favor was the relationship he built the past two years with Prescott, who is about to start the $260 million, four-year contract he signed in 2024. It’s the first NFL contract with an average annual value of $60 million. “Dak’s not making any coaching decisions, nor does he want to,” Stephen Jones said. “But, I can tell you, every team who made a coaching decision was looking at how they solve for their quarterback. That’s how you win in this league.” AP NFL:https://apnews.com/hub/nfl   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

NASA’s four Magnetospheric Multiscale, or MMS, satellites at the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, March 2015. (NASA via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have detected cosmic waves thatsound like birds chirpingin an unexpected place. These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency ashuman hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimichigh-pitched bird calls. Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they’ve never been measured before. “That opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,” said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on scientists sensing a chirping chorus in an unexpected place. Scientists still aren’t sure how the perturbations happen, but they thinkEarth’s magnetic fieldmay have something to do with it. The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft — NASA’s Van Allen Probes — heard the chirps from Earth’s radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection. The latest notes were picked up by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun’s magnetic fields. The new researchwas published Wednesdayin the journal Nature. Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.   “They are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,” said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email. The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth’s magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn’t expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form. “It’s very captivating, very compelling,” Jaynes said. “We definitely need to find more of these events.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

USAID humanitarian aid destined for Venezuela is displayed for the media at a warehouse next to the Tienditas International Bridge on the outskirts of Cucuta, Colombia, Feb. 19, 2019. (AP Photo/Fernando Vergara, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — At least 56 senior officials in the top U.S. aid and development agency were placed on leave Monday amid an investigation into an alleged effort to thwart President Donald Trump’s orders. A current official and a former official at the U.S. Agency for International Development confirmed the reason given for the move Monday. Both spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Several hundred contractors based in Washington and elsewhere also were laid off, the officials said. It follows Trump’s executive order last week that directed a sweeping90-day pause on most U.S. foreign assistancedisbursed through the State Department. As a result of the freeze, thousands of U.S.-funded humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide had stopped work or were preparing to do so. Without funds to pay staff, aid organizations were laying off hundreds of employees. An internal USAID notice sent late Monday and obtained by The Associated Press said new acting administrator Jason Gray had identified “several actions within USAID that appear to be designed to circumvent the President’s Executive Orders and the mandate from the American people.” “As a result, we have placed a number of USAID employees on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice while we complete our analysis of these actions,” Gray wrote. Trump has signed many executive orders since taking office a week ago, but the notice did not say which orders the employees were suspected of violating.  The senior agency officials put on leave were experienced employees who had served in multiple administrations, including Trump’s, the former USAID official said. Before those officials were removed from the job Monday, they were scrambling to help U.S.-funded aid organizations cope with the new funding freeze and seek waivers to continue life-saving activities, from getting clean water to war-displaced people in Sudan to continuing to monitor for bird flu globally, the former official said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has specifically exempted only emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt from the freeze on foreign assistance. The Trump administration and GOP lawmakers, many of them skeptical of the need for foreign aid and eager to see other countries pay more, say they will review each foreign assistance program to determine whether it is directly in U.S. interests and eliminate those that are deemed wasteful or liberal social engineering. Politico first reported the USAID officials being put on leave.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

Saturday, May 24, 1980. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)               Patrick Mahomes and theKansas City Chiefsaccomplished a feat that had never been done before: Getting back to the NFL’s championship game following back-to-back Super Bowl wins. Next up is the rare championship three-peat that hasn’t been accomplished in the NFL, NBA, NHL or Major League Baseball in more than 20 years. The most recent team in those four leagues to win three straight championships was the Los Angeles Lakers with Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant in the 2000-02 NBA Finals. Only two NFL teams have ever won three straight championships with Green Bay doing it from 1929-31 when the champion was determined by regular-season record and then again in the 1965-67 seasons. Vince Lombardi’s Packers won the final NFL championship before the start of the Super Bowl era in 1966 and then won the first two games between the AFL and NFL champions that determined the true kings of pro football. Since the end of that Green Bay run, there have been seven three-peats in the four biggest North American pro sports leagues. Here’s a look at those dynastic teams: Charlie Finley’s Swingin’ A’s dominated baseball in the early 1970s with a roster filled with big characters. Led by slugger Reggie Jackson, dominant starters Catfish Hunter and Vida Blue, the A’s knocked off the Reds, Mets and Dodgers in successive seasons to join the Yankees as the only baseball franchises to win three straight titles. Montreal dominated the NHL for decades with 23 Stanley Cups. The majority of those came in the pre-expansion Original Six era, but the Canadiens put together an impressive run in the late 1970s under coach Scotty Bowman. Led by dynamic scorer Guy LaFleur, two Cup-clinching goals by Jacque Lemaire, Hall of Fame defenseman Larry Robinson and goalie Ken Dryden, Montreal raced to four straight titles with a 48-10 record in the four postseason runs.  As soon as the Canadiens’ dynastic run ended, the Islanders started one of their own as the last hockey team to win at least three straight titles. Al Arbour’s squad was led by high-scoring wing Mike Bossy, defenseman Denis Potvin and goalie Billy Smith. The run started with an overtime clincher by Bobby Nystrom against Philadelphia in the 1980 Stanley Cup Final and then they lost only once in three other trips to the Final. After coming up short in back-to-back seasons against the Detroit Pistons, Michael Jordan and the Bulls broke through in the 1991 NBA Finals by beating Magic Johnson and the Lakers in five games. Chicago then dominated for most of the decade, repeating as champs in 1992 and 1993 for the NBA’s first three-peat since Boston won eight straight titles from 1959-66. After a brief step back in the 1994-95 seasons after Jordan stepped away to play baseball, the Bulls were even more dominant in their second run. Chicago won a then-record 72 regular-season games on the way to the title in 1996 and then won again the next two years before Jordan temporarily retired and the team broke up. The Yankees had several dynastic runs in their history, winning four straight World Series from 1936-39 and then five in a row from 1949-53. But they are the only team to win three straight World Series in the free agency era. Led by homegrown stars Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Bernie Williams, Joe Torre’s squad won the franchise’s first title in 18 years in 1996. After a playoff loss to Cleveland the next season, New York won three in a row starting with a then-record 114 wins in 1998. The Yankees dominated in the postseason with a 33-8 record. After helping the Bulls to both of their three-peats in the 1990s, coach Phil Jackson did the same when he joined a talented Lakers team led by O’Neal and Bryant that had underperformed before his arrival. The Lakers needed an epic Game 7 comeback against Portland in the Western Conference Finals in 2000 on the way to the first title, went 15-1 in the postseason to repeat the following year and then had to pull out another Game 7 conference final win in 2002 against Sacramento on the way to the three-peat.

        "content": "\"This is the very beginning of the Space Age.\" If one were to observe that I have written critically about Blue Origin over the last half-decade, they would not be wrong. The reality is that the space company founded by Jeff Bezos has underperformed. Its chief executive for most of this time, Bob Smith, was poorly regarded by his employees. He brought the worst of \"old space\" tendencies to Blue Origin from Honeywell. And under Smith's leadership, Blue was litigious, slow, and unproductive. Frankly, it was a bad look for Bezos. He was pumping something on the order of $2 billion a year into Blue Origin for what, exactly? Lawsuits against NASA? Jokes about BE-4 rocket engine delays? Ars published critical articles about Blue Origin because the company could be so much more, and the Western spaceflight community desperately wants a second new space contender to challenge SpaceX's increasingly dominant position. Finally, about 18 months ago, Bezos moved on from Bob Smith. He installed a long-time lieutenant from Amazon, Dave Limp, to get Blue Origin moving forward. Although there were concerns about Limp's background, which included little aerospace experience, it now seems clear that he has taken a strong hand at Blue since he took over the reins in December 2023. In the time I have spent with him, Limp seems energetic, enthused, and committed to turning the ship around at Blue Origin. He has made it clear that the mandate he received from Bezos is to execute on the company's programs—and to do so with urgency. \"Everybody believes in this mission,\" Limp said of Blue Origin's plans to enable millions of people to live and work in space. \"So that was kind of the foundation which you could build a house on. But I think that getting the organization a little bit more focused was critical. We had a lot of balls in the air. We still do, but it was important to make sure that the organization knows what the priorities were for us this year. We weren't getting anywhere without engines and without New Glenn.\" When I met with Limp and Bezos earlier this month on a balcony overlooking the main factory in Florida where future New Glenn rockets are built, there did seem to be a clear sense of urgency. Several times during our interview, one of us had to speak up to be heard over the clanging of this or banging of that. Days later, the New Glenn rocket took flight for the first time. The flight was a smashing success, with both the rocket's first and second stages performing nominally, an impressive achievement for a company's first orbital launch attempt. Although the first stage was not recovered, it was not expected to be on the first try. Many aerospace engineers and technicians will tell you that a rocket company doesn't become a real rocket company until it reaches orbit. Well, by that definition, Blue Origin is now a real rocket company. And with Limp's leadership and Bezos' renewed energy and enthusiasm, the successful launch appears to mark a critical moment for Blue looking ahead. The near-term step is clear: getting better at building engines and rockets and flying New Glenn regularly. At times during his remarks, Bezos sounded a lot like SpaceX founder Elon Musk,who has spoken about\"building the machine that builds the machine\" over the last decade with respect to both Tesla vehicles and SpaceX rockets. Asked about Blue's current priorities, Bezos responded, \"Rate manufacturing and driving urgency around the machine that makes the machine.\" He noted that Blue Origin built a factory in Huntsville, Alabama, but it took time to get it up and running, and then running efficiently. \"Same thing here with the second stage,\" he said, referring to the New Glenn factory in Florida. \"We need to produce a lot of second stages. And we need to produce a lot of booster stages, too. We’re completely vertically integrated, so it’s making those valves, it’s making the igniters. There needs to be rate manufacturing of everything you can imagine that goes into a rocket.\" One of the key questions about Blue Origin is whether it will push toward full reusability with New Glenn. In 2021,Ars first reportedon an effort codenamed \"Project Jarvis\" to develop a stainless steel upper stage that could be reused. The companyeven built a test tank, although the effort was eventually shelved. The current upper stage of the rocket uses two BE-3U engines and is 23 meters (77 feet) tall. Multiple sources have said the upper stage is expensive, at least in its initial configuration, and that this significantly inflates the cost of building New Glenn. Bezos said the company would \"compete\" two solutions to this problem against one another: developing a reusable upper stage or driving down the manufacturing cost of the stage. \"If you can drive your manufacturing costs low enough in rate manufacturing—if you ever get to a really well-oiled machine that makes the machine—it's possible that, because of the performance increase that you get with an expendable upper stage, that could be the right solution for a long time,\" Bezos said. \"So we're going to try to make the expendable upper stage so cheap to manufacture that a reusable stage can never compete with it. And we're going to try to make the reusable stage so operable that an expendable stage can never compete with it.\" This competition will play out over the coming years as Blue Origin seeks to ramp up its launch cadence. \"We'll see which one wins,\" Bezos said. \"It's not something that you can do on paper. You just have to try both.\" Blue Origin has not disclosed its internal costs to produce New Glenn, but with seven main engines on the booster stage, it's likely not cheap. From talking to Bezos and Limp, it's clear they want to drive down those costs. \"There is still a lot of room with these heavy lift vehicles to reduce cost even further,\" Limp said. \"To get a kilogram to any orbit or to the lunar surface, we've got to take two orders of magnitude out of the cost. If you think about what happened in the automotive industry or television industry, you can really crank down costs. So this is the very beginning of that.\" Blue Origin's motto is \"Gradatim Ferociter,\" which is Latin for \"Step by Step, Ferociously.\" (We're big fans of Latin at Ars. If you've ever stumbled over the name of the site, it's Latin for \"the art of technology,\" which is what we cover.) The long-running joke in the space industry is that we'd all like to see a little less \"gradatim\" and a little more \"ferociter\" from Blue Origin. The company's coat of arms—yes, it has one—prominently features two turtles. A turtle logo is also stamped onto a New Shepard spacecraft after every mission. This is a reference to one of Aesop's Fables, \"The Tortoise and the Hare,\" in which the slow and steady tortoise wins the race. Bezos clearly believes Blue Origin is the tortoise that will win the space race. When someone points out that Blue Origin has existed for nearly a quarter of a century, defenders of the company will say that Blue spent the first decade of that time largely operating as a think tank. Although this is, to some extent, true, Blue Origin was developing hardware by around 2005. From my reporting on the early years of SpaceX, I spoke with multiple engineers who were poached by Blue Origin or vice versa. There was a hot competition for the sharpest rocket scientists coming out of the best schools during this time. So yes, Blue Origin started as a think tank, and it remained small, but it absolutely has been developing hardware for two decades now. And what deliverables does it have to show for this? Its suborbital launch system, New Shepard, has flown 28 missions. Four of its BE-4 rocket engines have powered two launches of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket to orbit. And there was this month's New Glenn launch. That's it. It feels almost cruel to compare Blue Origin to SpaceX, which would be the \"hare\" in this fable. But it's necessary to do so. Founded in 2002, a couple of years after Blue Origin, SpaceX has launched about 450 orbital rockets to Blue Origin's one. It has put nearly six dozen astronauts into orbit, saving NASA from having to rely on Russia at a time of heightened geopolitical tension. Its Starlink constellation of more than 7,000 satellites delivers broadband Internet around the world. SpaceX is also developing the largest rocket in the world, Starship, with the aim of full reusability. When I wroteReentry, my book about the Falcon 9 era at SpaceX, I spoke with someone who had worked at both companies. I asked them what the biggest difference between the two environments was. The quote, from the time period long before Limp became chief executive, reveals the magnitude of the challenge. \"They are the world’s largest single-donor nonprofit,\" this person told me of Blue Origin. \"There is zero incentive to operate like SpaceX. Like, zero. I know I’m going to get fed no matter what. The doors will never close. They start off with a huge disadvantage there. When you have a funding model like that, you attract the dreamer who says, ‘Where can I go to work on something crazy and make a good salary at 40 hours a week? Where can you work on a space elevator and get paid? Who are the types of people who want to work on space elevators?’ So there’s a selection bias. You need to take extraordinary measures to account for that, and they don’t have them.\" In Blue Origin's defense, the products they have delivered have been of high quality. New Shepard has set the bar for suborbital space tourism. The BE-4 engine has performed excellently. And, of course, New Glenn performed well on its first flight. But there are many people in the industry who would like to see Blue Origin move much faster, and indeed, to come close to SpaceX, it must do exactly that. I asked Bezos about this. \"I would say, 'Stay tuned,'\" he said. \"This is the very beginning of the Space Age. When the history is finally written hundreds of years from now, the 1960s will be a certain kind of beginning, and [there were] certainly incredible accomplishments. But now we're really getting started. That was kind of pulled forward from its natural time, the space race with the Soviets. And now is the time when the real movement, the kind of golden age of space, is going to happen. It's still absolutely day one. There are going to be multiple winners. SpaceX is going to be successful. Blue Origin is going to be successful. And there are other companies who haven't even been founded yet that are going to grow into fantastic, giant space companies. So the vision that I think people should have is that this is the absolute beginning.\" When one walks through the New Glenn factory in Florida, the impressive scale is inescapable. Critically, the company appears to be hardware-rich, with multiple first and second stages in various states of work. When Bezos talks about launching several more times this year, it seems plausible. In the lobby of the main building, there's a mock-up of the company's first lunar lander, Mark 1. It towers three stories tall. It's massive. \"That’s the small one,\" Bezos commented. \"Mark 2 is twice as tall and twice as wide.\" These are impressive vehicles, built on a large scale. They're important first steps toward delivering cargo—Mark 1 could launch within the next 12 to 18 months—and eventually crew. But none of these next steps can happen without New Glenn as the foundational first step. That's why this month's launch was so important. Bezos is clearly thinking through all this methodically. First, develop the road to space. And once you have that, what's next? You need to learn to live off the land. \"In my mind, the next big step is in situ resource development,\" he said. \"So that's really a big unlock. For example, if you can make propellant on the Moon, that's a really big deal. You know, lifting a kilogram of mass off the Moon takes 25 times less energy than lifting a kilogram of mass off Earth. So if you're talking about moving about the Solar System, being able to get propellants and other materials, construction materials and so on from heavenly bodies is a big deal.\" It's a great vision, and it's nice to finally see Blue taking the first steps. What happens next will come down to Bezos' will, his finances, and whatever path the US government decides to follow. Days after New Glenn's first launch, Bezos attended the inauguration of Donald Trump, standing near Musk. The founder of SpaceX played a major role in getting Trump elected and has been advising him on space policy. Bezos and Musk, the tortoise and the hare, appeared chatty and friendly in a way that has not been the norm for the rivals. More commonly, they have sniped at one another rather than chummed it up. Perhaps now, they'll team up to help America spread among the stars. We'll see. Musk is interested in Mars, and Bezos is more fixated on the Moon. Ultimately, Trump may tell them both to follow their hearts, with the US government coming along for the ride. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

It was apparently a busy weekend for key players involved in Donald Trump's efforts to make a deal to save TikTok. Perhaps the most appealing option for ByteDance could be if Trump blessed a merger between TikTok and Perplexity AI—a San Francisco-based AI search company worth about $9 billion that appears to view a TikTok video content acquisition as a path to compete with major players like Google and OpenAI. On Sunday, Perplexity AI submitted a revised merger proposal to TikTok-owner ByteDance,reviewedby CNBC, which sourcestold AP Newsincluded feedback from the Trump administration. If the plan is approved, Perplexity AI and TikTok US would be merged into a new entity. And once TikTok reaches an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, the US government could own up to 50 percent of that new company, CNBC reported. In the proposal, Perplexity AI suggested that a \"fair price\" would be \"well north of $50 billion,\" but the final price will likely depend on how many of TikTok's existing investors decide to cash out following the merger. ByteDance has maintained a strong resistance to selling off TikTok, especially a sale including its recommendation algorithm. Not only would this option allow ByteDance to maintain a minority stake in TikTok, but it also would leave TikTok's recommendation algorithm under ByteDance's control, CNBC reported. The deal would also \"allow for most of ByteDance’s existing investors to retain their equity stakes,\" CNBC reported. But ByteDance may not like one potential part of the deal. An insider source told AP News that ByteDance would be required to allow \"full US board control.\" According to AP News, US government ownership of a large stake in TikTok would include checks to ensure the app doesn't become state controlled. The government's potential stake would apparently not grant the US voting power or a seat on the merged company's board. A source familiar with Perplexity AI's proposal confirmed to Ars that the reporting from CNBC and AP News is accurate. Over the weekend, there was also a lot of speculation about Oracle's involvement in negotiations. NPRreportedthat two sources with direct knowledge claimed that Trump was considering \"tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's global operations.\" That would be a seemingly bigger grab for the US than forcing ByteDance to divest only TikTok's US operations. \"The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,\" one source told NPR. \"ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.\" Oracle apparently met with the Trump administration on Friday and has another meeting scheduled this week to discuss Oracle buying a TikTok stake \"in the tens of billions,\" NPR reported. But Trump has disputed that, saying this past weekend that he \"never\" spoke to Oracle about buying TikTok, AP News reported. \"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Trump said, confirming that he would only make a deal to save TikTok \"if the United States benefits.\" All sources seemed to suggest that no deal was close to being finalized yet. Other potential Big Tech buyers include Microsoft oreven possibly Elon Musk(can you imagine TikTok merged with X?). On Saturday, Trump suggested that he would likely announce his decision on TikTok's future in the next 30 days. Meanwhile, TikTok access has become spotty in the US. Google and Apple dropped TikTok from their app stores when the divest-or-ban law kicked in, partly because of the legal limbo threatening hundreds of billions in fines if Trump changes his mind about enforcement. That means ByteDance currently can't push updates to US users, and anyone who offloads TikTok or purchases a new device can't download the app in popular distribution channels. \"If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing,\" Trump said. The divest-or-ban law is formally called theProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. For months, TikTok was told in court that the law required either a sale of TikTok US operations or a US ban, but nowByteDance seems to believethere's another option to keep TikTok in the US without forcing a sale. It remains unclear if lawmakers will approve Trump's plan if it doesn't force a sale of TikTok. US Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), who co-sponsored the law, issued astatementlast week insisting that \"ByteDance divesting remains the only real solution to protect our national security and guarantee Americans access to TikTok.\" Krishnamoorthi declined Ars' request to comment on whether leaked details of Trump's potential deal to save TikTok could potentially violate the divest-or-ban law. But debate will likely turn on how the law defines \"qualified divestiture.\" Under the law, qualified divestiture could be either a \"divestiture or similar transaction\" that meets two conditions. First, the transaction is one that Trump \"determines, through an interagency process, would result in the relevant foreign adversary controlled application no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" Second, the deal blocks any foreign adversary-controlled entity or affiliate from interfering in TikTok US operations, \"including any cooperation\" with foreign adversaries \"with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.\" That last bit seems to suggest that lawmakers might clash with Trump over ByteDance controlling TikTok's algorithm, even if a company like Oracle or Perplexity serves as a gatekeeper to Americans' data safeguarding US national security interests. Experts told NPR that ByteDance could feasibly maintain a minority stake in TikTok US under the law, with Trump seeming to have \"wide latitude to interpret\" what is or is not a qualified divestiture. One congressional staffer told NPR that lawmakers might be won over if the Trump administration secured binding legal agreements \"ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app.\" The US has tried to strike just such a national security agreement with ByteDance before, though, and it ended in lawmakers passing the divest-or-ban law. During the government's court battle with TikTok over the law, the government repeatedlyarguedthat prior agreement—also known as \"Project Texas,\" which ensured TikTok's US recommendation engine was stored in the Oracle cloud and deployed in the US by a TikTok US subsidiary—was not enough to block Chinese influence. Proposed in 2022, the agreement was abruptly ended in 2023 when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) determined only divestiture would resolve US concerns. CFIUS did not respond to Ars' request for comment. The key problem at that point was ByteDance maintaining control of the algorithm, the government successfully argued in a case thatended in a Supreme Court victory. \"Even under TikTok’s proposed national security agreement, the source code for the recommendation engine would originate in China,\" the government warned. That seemingly leaves a vulnerability that any Trump deal allowing ByteDance to maintain control of the algorithm would likely have to reconcile. \"Under Chinese national-security laws, the Chinese government can require a China-based company to 'surrender all its data,'\" the USargued. That ultimately turned TikTok into \"an espionage tool\" for the Chinese Communist Party. There's no telling yet if Trump's plan can set up a better version of Project Texas or convince China to sign off on a TikTok sale. Analysts have suggested that China may agree to a TikTok sale if Trump backs down on tariff threats. ByteDance did not respond to Ars' request for comment.

        "content": "A new approach to simulating the electrons of small molecules like catalysts. One of the most frequently asked questions about quantum computers is a simple one: When will they be useful? If you talk to people in the field, you'll generally get a response in the form of another question: useful for what? Quantum computing can be applied to a large range of problems, some of them considerably more complex than others. Utility will come for some of the simpler problems first, but further hardware progress is needed before we can begin tackling some of the more complex ones. One that should be easiest to solve involves modeling the behavior of some simple catalysts. The electrons of these catalysts, which are critical for their chemical activity, obey the rules of quantum mechanics, which makes it relatively easy to explore them with a quantum computer. But it's not easy to understand how those simulations will actually work or what limits dictate the hardware we'll need before we can run them—generally estimated to be around 100 error-corrected qubits. On Wednesday, Nature Physics published a paper that describes the simulation of some aspects of simple catalysts on quantum computers and provides a way to dramatically simplify the calculations. The resulting algorithmic improvements mean that we may not need to wait for error correction to run useful simulations. The behavior of a catalyst depends on its electrons, and their behavior depends on a combination of the orbital they occupy and their spin (which can be up or down). If electrons share an orbital with a partner, they will have opposite spins and essentially cancel each other out. But a lot of chemistry involves unpaired electrons, which have what you might think of as exposed spin. The spins affect the energy levels they can occupy and can interact with unpaired spins elsewhere in the molecule. But spin is a quantum property, with all the complications that ensue from that. And the more unpaired spins a molecule has, the more complicated the interactions among them. The net result is that predicting the spins of a molecule like a catalyst quickly becomes computationally intractable. But since a molecule's spins are a quantum system, it's possible to simulate their behavior on other quantum systems. In fact, a number of approaches to quantum computers, including those involving trapped ions or neutral atoms, store qubits in spins. But fully simulating how the electrons of a molecule interact over time involves a lot of qubits and a long series of the one- and two-qubit gate operations that are central to quantum computations. The new work, performed primarily by researchers at Berkeley and Harvard, describes a method to make a simulation work far more efficiently. The process begins by using regular computers to simplify a problem to be solved using quantum hardware. This essentially gets rid of some aspects of the problem that aren't particularly relevant to most catalysts, like their behavior under extreme conditions. Instead, it simplifies the description of the system (termed a Hamiltonian) down to focus on the behavior of any unpaired spins when the system is at low energies. The Hamiltonian that describes the spins is then mapped onto a quantum processor, with a cluster of linked qubits devoted to the behavior of each individual spinning electron. This system is generic enough to be mapped onto any quantum hardware, and it can be made to evolve over time, just as the real-world system does. But the researchers found they could get better performance on the quantum side of things by using a quantum computer based on neutral atoms. A typical quantum computing algorithm assumes that all computational operations, termed gates, are done using either an individual qubit or pairs of qubits (these are termed one- or two-qubit gates). But since neutral atoms can be moved around, it's possible to group even more of them so that a small cluster of atoms performs a gate. These multi-qubit gates turn out to allow the specific computations needed here to be performed far more efficiently than they ever could if limited to two-qubit gates. The net result is a much faster operation involving far fewer gates. That's important because errors in quantum hardware increase as a function of both time and the number of operations. The researchers then used this approach to explore a chemical, Mn4O5Ca, that plays a key role in photosynthesis. Using this approach, they showed it's possible to calculate what's called the \"spin ladder,\" or the list of the lowest-energy states the electrons can occupy. The energy differences between these states correspond to the wavelengths of light they can absorb or emit, so this also defines the spectrum of the molecule. We're not quite ready to run this system on today's quantum computers, as the error rates are still a bit too high. But because the operations needed to run this sort of algorithm can be done so efficiently, the error rates don't have to come down very much before the system will become viable. The primary determinant of whether it will run into an error is how far down the time dimension you run the simulation, plus the number of measurements of the system you take over that time. \"The algorithm is especially promising for near-term devices having favorable resource requirements quantified by the number of snapshots (sample complexity) and maximum evolution time (coherence) required for accurate spectral computation,\" the researchers wrote. But the work also makes a couple of larger points. The first is that quantum computers are fundamentally unlike other forms of computation we've developed. They're capable of running things that look like traditional algorithms, where operations are performed and a result is determined. But they're also quantum systems that are growing in complexity with each new generation of hardware, which makes them great at simulating other quantum systems. And there are a number of hard problems involving quantum systems we'd like to solve. In some ways, we may only be starting to scratch the surface of quantum computers' potential. Up until quite recently, there were a lot of hypotheticals; it now appears we're on the cusp of using one for some potentially useful computations. And that means more people will start thinking about clever ways we can solve problems with them—including cases like this, where the hardware would be used in ways its designers might not have even considered.

        "content": "Flaws also allowed access to one year of location history. About a year ago, security researcher Sam Curry bought his mother a Subaru, on the condition that, at some point in the near future, she let him hack it. It took Curry until last November, when he was home for Thanksgiving, to begin examining the 2023 Impreza's Internet-connected features and start looking for ways to exploit them. Sure enough, he and a researcher working with him online, Shubham Shah, soon discovered vulnerabilities in a Subaru web portal that let them hijack the ability to unlock the car, honk its horn, and start its ignition, reassigning control of those features to any phone or computer they chose. Most disturbing for Curry, though, was that they found they could also track the Subaru's location—not merely where it was at the moment but also where it had been for the entire year that his mother had owned it. The map of the car’s whereabouts was so accurate and detailed, Curry says, that he was able to see her doctor visits, the homes of the friends she visited, even which exact parking space his mother parked in every time she went to church. “You can retrieve at least a year's worth of location history for the car, where it's pinged precisely, sometimes multiple times a day,” Curry says. “Whether somebody's cheating on their wife or getting an abortion or part of some political group, there are a million scenarios where you could weaponize this against someone.” Curry and Shah todayrevealed in a blog posttheir method for hacking and tracking millions of Subarus, which they believe would have allowed hackers to target any of the company's vehicles equipped with its digital features known as Starlink in the US, Canada, or Japan. Vulnerabilities they found in a Subaru website intended for the company's staff allowed them to hijack an employee's account to both reassign control of cars’ Starlink features and also access all the vehicle location data available to employees, including the car’s location every time its engine started, as shown in their video below. Curry and Shah reported their findings to Subaru in late November, and Subaru quickly patched its Starlink security flaws. But the researchers warn that the Subaru web vulnerabilities are just the latest in a long series of similar web-based flaws they and other security researchers working with them have found that have affected well over a dozen carmakers, including Acura, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia, Toyota, and many others. There’s little doubt, they say, that similarly serious hackable bugs exist in other auto companies' web tools that have yet to be discovered. In Subaru's case, in particular, they also point out that their discovery hints at how pervasively those with access to Subaru's portal can track its customers' movements, a privacy issue that will last far longer than the web vulnerabilities that exposed it. “The thing is, even though this is patched, this functionality is still going to exist for Subaru employees,” Curry says. “It's just normal functionality that an employee can pull up a year's worth of your location history.” When WIRED reached out to Subaru for comment on Curry and Shah's findings, a spokesperson responded in a statement that “after being notified by independent security researchers, [Subaru] discovered a vulnerability in its Starlink service that could potentially allow a third party to access Starlink accounts. The vulnerability was immediately closed and no customer information was ever accessed without authorization.” The Subaru spokesperson also confirmed to WIRED that “there are employees at Subaru of America, based on their job relevancy, who can access location data.\" The company offered as an example that employees have that access to share a vehicle's location with first responders in the case when a collision is detected. “All these individuals receive proper training and are required to sign appropriate privacy, security, and NDA agreements as needed,” Subaru's statement added. “These systems have security monitoring solutions in place which are continually evolving to meet modern cyber threats.” Responding to Subaru's example of notifying first responders about a collision, Curry notes that would hardly require a year's worth of location history. The company didn't respond to WIRED asking how far back it keeps customers' location histories and makes them available to employees. Shah and Curry's research that led them to the discovery of Subaru's vulnerabilities began when they found that Curry's mother's Starlink app connected to the domain SubaruCS.com, which they realized was an administrative domain for employees. Scouring that site for security flaws, they found that they could reset employees' passwords simply by guessing their email address, which gave them the ability to take over any employee's account whose email they could find. The password reset functionality did ask for answers to two security questions, but they found that those answers were checked with code that ran locally in a user's browser, not on Subaru's server, allowing the safeguard to be easily bypassed. “There were really multiple systemic failures that led to this,” Shah says. The two researchers say they found the email address for a Subaru Starlink developer on LinkedIn, took over the employee's account, and immediately found that they could use that staffer's access to look up any Subaru owner by last name, zip code, email address, phone number, or license plate to access their Starlink configurations. In seconds, they could then reassign control of the Starlink features of that user's vehicle, including the ability to remotely unlock the car, honk its horn, start its ignition, or locate it, as shown in the video below. Those vulnerabilities alone, for drivers, present serious theft and safety risks. Curry and Shah point out that a hacker could have targeted a victim for stalking or theft, looked up someone's vehicle's location, then unlocked their car at any time—though a thief would have to somehow also use a separate technique to disable the car's immobilizer, the component that prevents it from being driven away without a key. Those car hacking and tracking techniques alone are far from unique. Last summer, Curry and another researcher, Neiko Rivera,demonstrated to WIREDthat they could pull off a similar trick with any of millions of vehicles sold by Kia. Over the prior two years, a larger group of researchers, of which Curry and Shah are a part,discovered web-based security vulnerabilities that affected carssold by Acura, BMW, Ferrari, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Rolls Royce, and Toyota. More unusual in Subaru's case, Curry and Shah say, is that they were able to access fine-grained, historical location data for Subarus going back at least a year. Subaru may in fact collect multiple years of location data, but Curry and Shah tested their technique only on Curry's mother, who had owned her Subaru for about a year. Curry argues that Subaru's extensive location tracking is a particularly disturbing demonstration of the car industry's lack of privacy safeguards around its growing collection of personal data on drivers. “It's kind of bonkers,” he says. “There's an expectation that a Google employee isn't going to be able to just go through your emails in Gmail, but there's literally a button on Subaru's admin panel that lets an employee view location history.” The two researchers’ work contributes to a growing sense of concern over the enormous amount of location data that car companies collect. In December, information a whistleblower provided to the German hacker collective the Chaos Computer Computer and Der Spiegel revealed that Cariad, a software company that partners with Volkswagen, hadleft detailed location datafor 800,000 electric vehicles publicly exposed online. Privacy researchers at the Mozilla Foundation in Septemberwarned in a reportthat “modern cars are a privacy nightmare,” noting that 92 percent give car owners little to no control over the data they collect, and 84 percent reserve the right to sell or share your information. (Subaru tells WIRED that it “does not sell location data.”) “While we worried that our doorbells and watches that connect to the Internet might be spying on us, car brands quietly entered the data business by turning their vehicles into powerful data-gobbling machines,” Mozilla's report reads. Curry and Shah's discovery of Subaru's security vulnerabilities in its tracking demonstrate a particularly egregious exposure of that data—but also a privacy problem that's hardly less disturbing now that the vulnerabilities are patched, says Robert Herrell, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of California, which hassought to create legislationfor limiting a car's data tracking. “It seems like there are a bunch of employees at Subaru that have a scary amount of detailed information,” Herrell says. “People are being tracked in ways that they have no idea are happening.” This story originally appeared onwired.com.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Physicist used interaction graphs to show how pieces attack and defend to analyze 20,000 top matches. The game of chess has long been central to computer science and AI-related research, most notably in IBM's Deep Blue in the 1990s and, more recently, AlphaZero. But the game is about more than algorithms, according toMarc Barthelemy, a physicist at the Paris-Saclay University in France, with layers of depth arising from the psychological complexity conferred by player strategies. Now, Barthelmey has taken things one step further by publishing anew paperin the journal Physical Review E that treats chess as a complex system, producing a handy metric that can help predict the proverbial \"tipping points\" in chess matches. In his paper, Barthelemy citesRichard Reti, an early 20th-century chess master who gave a series of lectures in the 1920s on developing a scientific understanding of chess. It was an ambitious program involving collecting empirical data, constructing typologies, and devising laws based on those typologies, but Reti's insights fell by the wayside as advances in computer science came to dominate the field. That's understandable. \"With its simple rules yet vast strategic depth, chess provides an ideal platform for developing and testing algorithms in AI, machine learning, and decision theory,\" Barthelemy writes. Barthelemy's own expertise is in the application of statistical physics to complex systems, as well as the emerging science of cities. He realized that the history of the scientific study of chess had overlooked certain key features, most notably how certain moves at key moments can drastically alter the game; the matches effectively undergo a kind ofphase transition. The rise of online chess platforms means there are now very large datasets ripe for statistical analysis, and researchers have made use of that,studyingpower-lawdistributions, for example, as well asresponse time distributionin rapid chess and long-rangememory effectsin game sequences. For his analysis, Barthelemy chose to represent chess as a decision tree in which each \"branch\" leads to a win, loss, or draw. Players face the challenge of finding the best move amid all this complexity, particularly midgame, in order to steer gameplay into favorable branches. That's where those crucial tipping points come into play. Such positions are inherently unstable, which is why even a small mistake can have a dramatic influence on a match's trajectory. Barthelemy has re-imagined a chess match as a network of forces in which pieces act as the network's nodes, and the ways they interact represent the edges, using an interaction graph to capture how different pieces attack and defend one another. The most important chess pieces are those that interact with many other pieces in a given match, which he calculated by measuring how frequently a node lies on the shortest path between all the node pairs in the network (its \"betweenness centrality\"). He also calculated so-called \"fragility scores,\" which indicate how easy it is to remove those critical chess pieces from the board. And he was able to apply this analysis to more than 20,000 actual chess matches played by the world's top players over the last 200 years. Barthelemy found that his metric could indeed identify tipping points in specific matches. Furthermore, when he averaged his analysis over a large number of games, an unexpected universal pattern emerged. “We observe a surprising universality: the average fragility score is the same for all players and for all openings,” Barthelemy writes. And in famous chess matches, \"the maximum fragility often coincides with pivotal moments, characterized by brilliant moves that decisively shift the balance of the game.” Specifically, fragility scores start to increase about eight moves before the critical tipping point position occurs and stay high for some 15 moves after that. \"These results suggest that positional fragility follows a common trajectory, with tension peaking in the middle game and dissipating toward the endgame,\" he writes. \"This analysis highlights the complex dynamics of chess, where the interaction between attack and defense shapes the game's overall structure.\" Physical Review E, 2025.

        "content": "New research \"Computer-Use Agent\" AI model can perform multi-step tasks through a web browser. On Thursday, OpenAI released a research preview of \"Operator,\" a web automation tool that uses a new AI model calledComputer-Using Agent(CUA) to control a web browser through a visual interface. The system performs tasks by viewing and interacting with on-screen elements like buttons and text fields similar to how a human would. Operator is available today for subscribers of the $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan atoperator.chatgpt.com. The company plans to expand to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users later. OpenAI intends to integrate these capabilities directly into ChatGPT and later release CUA through its API for developers. Operator watches on-screen content in its virtual environment while it uses an internal browser and executes tasks through simulated keyboard and mouse inputs. The Computer-Using Agent processes screenshots of its browser interface to understand the browser's state and then makes decisions about clicking, typing, and scrolling based on its observations. OpenAI's release follows other tech companies as they push into what are often called \"agentic\" AI systems, which can take actions on a user's behalf. Google announcedProject Marinerin December 2024, which performs automated tasks through the Chrome browser, and two months earlier, in October 2024, Anthropic launched a web automation toolcalled \"Computer Use\"focused on developers that can control a user's mouse cursor and take actions on a computer. \"The Operator interface looks very similar to Anthropic's Claude Computer Use demo from October,\"wroteAI researcher Simon Willison on his blog, \"even down to the interface with a chat panel on the left and a visible interface being interacted with on the right.\" To use a browser like you would, the Computer-Using Agent works in multiple steps. First, it captures screenshots to monitor its progress, then analyzes those images (using GPT-4o's vision capabilities with additional reinforcement learning) to process raw pixel data. Next, it determines what actions to take and then performs virtual inputs to control the browser. This iterative loop design reportedly lets the system recover from errors and handle complex tasks across different applications. While it's working, Operator shows a view of its browser window and of the actions taking place. The technology behind Operator is still relatively new and far from perfect. The model reportedly performs best at repetitive web tasks like creating shopping lists or playlists. It struggles more with unfamiliar interfaces like tables and calendars, and does poorly with complex text editing (with a 40 percent success rate), according to OpenAI's internal testing data. OpenAI reported the system achieved an 87 percent success rate on theWebVoyagerbenchmark, which tests live sites like Amazon and Google Maps. OnWebArena, which uses offline test sites for training autonomous agents, Operator's success rate dropped to 58.1 percent. For computer operating system tasks, CUA set an apparent record of 38.1 percent success on theOSWorldbenchmark, surpassing previous models but still falling short of human performance at 72.4 percent. With this imperfect research preview, OpenAI hopes to gather user feedback and refine the system's capabilities. The company acknowledges CUA won't perform reliably in all scenarios but plans to improve its reliability across a wider range of tasks through user testing. At the moment, all of the browsing and activity takes place within Operator's virtual environment. OpenAI says it built multiple safety controls into Operator, requiring user confirmation before completing sensitive actions like sending emails or making purchases. Operator also has limits on what it can browse, set by OpenAI. It cannot access certain website categories, including gambling and adult content. To catch attempts at subverting Operator with jailbreaks andprompt injections, which might hypothetically be embedded in websites that the AI model browses, OpenAI says it has implemented real-time moderation and detection systems. OpenAI reports the system recognized all but one case of prompt injection attempts during an early internal red-teaming session. However, Willison, who frequently covers AI security issues, isn't convinced Operator can't be subverted, especially as new threats emerge. \"Color me skeptical,\" hewrotein his blog post. \"I imagine we'll see all kinds of novel successful prompt injection style attacks against this model once the rest of the world starts to explore it.\" As Willison points out, OpenAI acknowledges these risks in its System Card documentation: \"Despite proactive testing and mitigation efforts, certain challenges and risks remain due to the difficulty of modeling the complexity of real-world scenarios and the dynamic nature of adversarial threats.\" OpenAI says it has implemented several privacy controls: Users can opt out of having their data used for model training through ChatGPT settings, delete all browsing data with one click in Operator settings, and log out of all sites simultaneously. When users need to input sensitive information like passwords or payment details, a \"takeover mode\" activates where Operator stops collecting screenshots. Even with these precautions, Willison provided his own Operator privacy advice on his blog: \"Start a fresh session for each task you outsource to Operator to ensure it doesn't have access to your credentials for any sites that you have used via the tool in the past. If you're having it spend money on your behalf, let it get to the checkout, then provide it with your payment details and wipe the session straight afterwards.\" This article was updated on Janary 25, 2025 to clarify that Operator works within its own virtual browser environment.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "With help from Google, a focused team wants to make sustainable watches. \"We're making new Pebble watches,\" writes original Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky onthe \"rePebble\" launch page. Eight years after Pebble's time as an upstart watchmakercame to an end, Migicovsky says that he's working with a small team on \"a Pebble-like smartwatch that runs open source PebbleOS.\" There should be some new features, but new watches would stay \"true to the core Pebble vision.\" With enough signups, the site claims, that watch gets built. Pebble, launched in 2012, was one of the first smartphone-era smartwatches, selling 2 million models and serving as an earlysuccess story for hardware crowdfunding. After the relativelyinexperienced hardware firmran into funding gaps and stiff competition from the Apple Watch, Pebble stopped making its own watches afteran IP-only sale to Fitbit in 2016.Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, gaining some original Pebble workers as well, who then helpedthe Rebble projectlaunch replacement web services for the watch and kept the watch working onthe newest Android phones. Why would someone want to make 2016's e-paper watches again? One big reason is that Google, pushed along by its in-house Pebble vets and Rebble volunteers, hasreleased most of the source code for Pebble's operating system. It's missing some blobs of proprietary chipset and Bluetooth stack code, but it can be built, if not fully compiled. There is \"a non-trivial amount of work to do in finding replacements\" for those pieces, as well as bringing years-old source code up to date, Google's post notes. But anyone who wants to make a Pebble-ish watch can nowuse Pebble's code. With that code, Migicovsky can address the second reason for a new Pebble—nothing has really replaced the original.On his blog, Migicovsky defines the core of Pebble's appeal: always-on screen; long battery life; a \"simple and beautiful user experience\" focused on useful essentials; physical buttons; and \"Hackable,\" including custom watchfaces. Migicovsky writes that a small team is tackling the hardware aspect, making a watch that runs PebbleOS and \"basically has the same specs and features as Pebble\" but with \"fun new stuff as well.\" Crucially, they're taking a different path than the original Pebble company: \"This time round, we’re keeping things simple. Lessons were learned last time! I’m building a small, narrowly focused company to make these watches. I don’t envision raising money from investors, or hiring a big team. The emphasis is on sustainability. I want to keep making cool gadgets and keep Pebble going long into the future.\" Ars asked Migicovsky by email if modern-day Pebbles would have better interoperability with Apple's iPhones than the original models. \"No, even less now!\" Migicovsky replied, pointing tothe Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple in 2024. That lawsuit claims that Apple \"limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches\" to keep people using Apple Watches and then, as a result, less likely to switch away from iPhones. Apple has limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches so that users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones. The core functionality Migicovsky detailed, he wrote, was still possible on iOS. Certain advanced features, like replying to notifications with voice dictation, may be limited to Android phones. Migicovsky's site and blog do not set a timeline for new hardware. His last major project, the multi-protocol chat app Beeper, wassold to WordPress.com owner Automatticin April 2024, following aprotracted battle with Appleover access to its iMessage protocol.

        "content": "US agencies wasting billions on empty offices an “embarrassment,” RTO memo says. All federal agencies received amemoWednesday requiring the termination of remote work options, with return-to-office plans due by end of day Friday. In the memo, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, Charles Ezell, told the heads and acting heads of all departments and agencies that the change is due to Donald Trump'sReturn to In-Person Workpresidential memorandum, which carved out space for some exemptions and ordered: Heads of all departments and agencies in the executive branch of Government shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis, provided that the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary. According to the memo, \"most federal offices presently are virtually abandoned,\" with \"the vast majority of federal office workers\" having \"not returned to in-person work\" after transitioning to remote work during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only has this \"devastated\" the local economy in Washington, D.C., the memo said, but having so many federal offices sitting empty also serves as a \"national embarrassment.\" \"Virtually unrestricted telework has led to poorer government services and made it more difficult to supervise and train government workers,\" Ezell said, citing areportfrom the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. That report was published last week, calling out the lack of data supporting remote work policies. It found that \"American taxpayers are wasting billions to pay for owned and leased federal office space that remain largely vacant\" and accused the Biden administration of making \"no real attempt to determine the effects of widespread telework.\" \"While the Biden-Harris Administration has touted the benefits of telework, it generally has had no means of measuring the effects of telework on agency mission outcomes or on addressing any existing recruitment or retention challenges,\" the report noted among key findings. Ezell's memo expanded criticism of the Biden administration's approach to remote work, suggesting that it enabled federal unions' alleged attempts \"to abuse the collective-bargaining process to guarantee full-time telework into the indefinite future and forestall any requirement to return to the office.\" Suspecting that the \"rampant use of telework is likely underreported,\" the committee's report concluded that \"even the reported levels are excessive, there is little evidence that it is enhancing productivity or addressing recruitment and retention gaps, and there is evidence it is harming agency missions and citizen-facing services.\" To overcome these supposed deficiencies, the committee recommended that remote work policies be linked to performance metrics, rather than \"employee preferences or union demands.\" Any remote work that is granted should be tracked through automated systems, the report further prescribed, and any attempts for federal agencies to compete for talent using remote work perks should not be tolerated. This will allow the government to alleviate the \"national embarrassment\" of empty offices and \"dispose of unneeded property and terminate unnecessary leases,\" the report said. While some employees may be eligible for RTO exemptions—either to accommodate a disability or qualifying medical condition, or for some \"other compelling reason certified by the agency head and the employee’s supervisor\"—Ezell's memo insisted that a general return-to-office push was necessary. He said that Trump's presidential memo reflected \"a simple reality\" that \"the only way to get employees back to the office is to adopt a centralized policy requiring return-to-work for all agencies across the federal government.\" \"Seeking to cajole individual agencies to try to get employees to return to the worksite has not succeeded,\" Ezell said. Although Trump's memo set no deadline for RTO efforts to begin, Ezell gave federal agency heads rather short notice to fall in line. All agencies must submit their RTO plans by 5 pm ET on Friday, January 24, Ezell's memo said. Those plans should specify \"the date that the agency will be in full compliance with the new telework policy,\" with a recommended deadline of 30 days to comply, Ezell said.

        "content": "Apple has released software updates for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and more. As is custom, Apple rolled out software updates to all its platforms at once today. All users should now have access to the public releases of iOS 18.3, macOS Sequoia 15.3, watchOS 11.3, iPadOS 15.3, tvOS 15.3, and visionOS 2.3. Also, as usual, the iOS update is the meatiest of the bunch. Most of the changes relate toApple Intelligence, a suite of features built on deep learning models. The first Apple Intelligence features were introduced in iOS 18, with additional ones added in iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2 iOS 18.3 doesn't add any significant new features to Apple Intelligence—instead, it tweaks what's already there. Whereas Apple Intelligence was opt-in in previous OS versions, it is now on by default in iOS 18.3 on supported devices. For the most part, that shouldn't be a noticeable change for the majority of users, except for one thing: notification summaries. As we'vereported, the feature that summarizes large batches of notifications using a large language model is hit-and-miss at best. For most apps, not much has changed on that front, but Apple announced that with iOS 18.3, it'stemporarily disabling notification summariesfor apps from the \"News & Entertainment\" category in light of criticismsby the BBCand others about how the feature was getting the substance of headlines wrong. The feature will still mess up summarizing your text messages and emails, though. Apple says it has changed the presentation of summaries to make it clearer that they are distinct from other, non-AI generated summaries and that they are in beta and may be inaccurate. Other updates include one to visual intelligence, a feature available on the most recent phones that gives you information on objects your camera is focused on. It can now identify more plants and animals, and you can create calendar events from flyers or posters seen in your viewfinder. On the macOS side, Macs now have access to Genmoji, a tool for creating emojis from text prompts. Both macOS and iPadOS got most of the same notification summary changes as on iOS, too. The Apple Watch didn't get much with the watchOS 11.3 update—just a new watch face. tvOS, visionOS, and the HomePod software also got updates, but they just contain bug fixes. Visual intelligence with Camera Control (All iPhone 16 models) - Add an event to Calendar from a poster or flyer- Easily identify plants and animals Notification summaries (All iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max) - Easily manage settings for notification summaries from the Lock Screen- Updated style for summarized notifications better distinguishes them from other notifications by using italicized text as well as the glyph- Notification summaries for News & Entertainment apps are temporarily unavailable, and users who opt-in will see them again when the feature becomes available This update includes the following enhancements and bug fixes: - Calculator repeats the last mathematical operation when you tap the equals sign again- Fixes an issue where the keyboard might disappear when initiating a typed Siri request- Resolves an issue where audio playback continues until the song ends even after closing Apple Music Some features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices.

        "title": "For real, we may be taking blood pressure readings all wrong",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Blood pressure readings while lying down beat seated readings at predicting heart risks. Last year, a study highlighted thatyour doctor's office might be taking your blood pressure wrong. The current best practice is to take seated blood pressure readings with a detailed protocol: Patients must not eat, drink, or exercise for 30 minutes prior; they must have an empty bladder and sit calmly for five minutes prior to the first reading; they must sit with their feet uncrossed and flat on the floor; their back should be supported; and—a big one that's often overlooked—they must keep the arm to be measured resting on a flat surface at the height of their heart, not higher or lower. While the setup is often different from what happens in a bustling medical office, a new study blows away quibbles over protocol and suggests that even when done perfectly, the method is second-rate. We shouldn't be sitting at all when we take our blood pressure—we should be lying down. According tothe study, published in JAMA Cardiology and led by researchers at Harvard, blood pressure readings measured while lying down were significantly better at indicating risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and death than were seated blood pressure readings alone. For instance, people who had high blood pressure readings while lying down but not while seated had an estimated 53 percent higher relative risk of coronary heart disease than people with normal blood pressure. They had a 51 percent higher risk of heart failure, a 62 percent higher risk of stroke, a 78 percent higher risk of fatal coronary heart disease, and a 34 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality. For people who had high blood pressure readings only when sitting (normal readings while lying down), there was no statistically significant difference in risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, or stroke compared to people with normal blood pressure. The only statistically significant differences were a 41 percent higher risk of fatal coronary heart disease (compared to the 78 percent seen in those with high readings lying down) and an 11 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality. (In this study, high blood pressure readings were defined for both positions as those with systolic readings (the top number) of 130 mm Hg or greater or diastolic readings (the bottom number) of 80 mm Hg or greater.) The people with the highest risks across the board were those who had high blood pressure readings while both sitting and lying down. \"These findings suggest that measuring supine [lying down] BP may be useful for identifying elevated BP and latent CVD risk,\" the researchers conclude. For now, the findings should be considered preliminary. Such an analysis and finding should be repeated with a different group of people to confirm the link. And as to the bigger question of whether using medication to lower supine blood pressure (rather than seated blood pressure) is more effective at reducing risk, it's likely that clinical trials will be necessary. Still, the analysis had some notable strengths that make the findings attention-worthy. The study's size and design are robust. Researchers tapped into data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a study established in 1987 with middle-aged people living in one of four US communities (Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington County, Maryland). This study included data from 11,369 ARIC participants, mostly White and Black, and as such, the results are considered generalizable to a broad population. ARIC study staff underwent rigorous training to conduct the study. Measurements were highly standardized, researchers had extensive health information and data on the participants, and the data included more than three decades of follow-up. The findings also jibe with previous studies finding that high blood pressure readings during nightly sleep (when people are generally lying down) are also strongly linked to higher cardiovascular risks. Normally, blood pressure naturally drops during sleep, but those who maintain a higher pressure face substantial risk. While the ARIC study did not include blood pressure readings during sleep, it's hypothesized that the lying-down position may be a factor in the associated risks of nocturnal high blood pressure. As for why lying-down blood pressure may be more telling than sitting pressure, researchers only have hypotheses. It could be that lying-down readings are a more precise assessment of true resting blood pressure, which is what seated readings try to ascertain (hence the detailed protocol). It could be that the bodily mechanisms causing high blood pressure while lying down are more directly linked to cardiovascular outcomes. Or maybe high blood pressure while lying down is simply harder on the heart and brain than it is when upright. Researchers will need more data to clarify the role of lying-down blood pressure readings in estimating cardiovascular risks. But for those with blood pressure monitors at home, it might not be a terrible idea to see how your readings compare between sitting and lying down. The authors note that in the ARIC study, lying-down readings were done after a 20-minute rest period in that position. Readings were taken up to 5 times every 20 to 30 seconds over the course of two minutes. The researchers note that future studies evaluating the use of lying-down measurement in medical appointments should look to see if shorter rest periods would also work.

        "content": "The MX-5 is the perfect antidote to all those big SUVs. DAYTONA, Florida—This might make you feel old, but the Mazda MX-5 Miata just turned 35. Still in its fourth generation—better known to Miata nerds as the \"ND\"—this small, affordable, lightweight sports car is the perfect antidote to, well, just about everything else on the roads. And to celebrate this latest milestone, Mazda has created a new special anniversary edition, which it unveiled at this past weekend's Rolex 24 at Daytona. When the Miata debuted in 1989, it was something of a game-changer. Inspired by classic European roadsters like those built by MG and Alfa Romeo, it was small, lithe, and, most importantly, reliable. It didn't hurt that it looked nice and was great to drive. It's also been something of a hit among amateur racers—Mazda is proud that each weekend, more Miatas are on track than any other make of car. That goes some way to explaining why Mazda chose this year's Rolex 24 at Daytona to reveal the new 35th Anniversary Edition—the MX-5 Cup series is probably IMSA's most exciting support series. The 35th Anniversary Edition is the latest in a long line of special edition Miatas, including anniversary cars for the 10th, 20th, 25th, and 30th editions. The focus here was on \"classic elegance,\" with Artisan Red paint that's almost burgundy, plus a tan Nappa leather interior that will remind some of the tan leather interiors that Mazda used on some NAs. The 35th Anniversary Edition is similar to the Grand Touring trim, which means features like heated seats, and Mazda says it has added a limited-slip differential, additional bracing, and some newly tuned Bilstein dampers. There's also a beige convertible roof and some shiny 17-inch alloy wheels. It's also a bit more expensive than other Miatas, with an MSRP of $36,250. That's $1,620 more expensive than the next-most-expensive six-speed Miata (the Grand Touring), but it does come with the aforementioned extra equipment. Getting a hold of one might be a bit tricky, though—Mazda will only import 300 into the US. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "A new Chinese AI app is sparking existential panic in American AI companies and investors. On Monday, Nvidia stockdove 17 percentamid worries over the rise of Chinese AI companyDeepSeek, whose R1 reasoning modelstunned industry observerslast week by challenging American AI supremacy with a low-cost, freely available AI model, and whose AI assistant appjumped to the topof the iPhone App Store's \"Free Apps\" category over the weekend, overtaking ChatGPT. The drama started around January 20 when Chinese AI startup DeepSeekannounced R1, a new simulated reasoning (SR) model that it claimed could match OpenAI's o1 in reasoning benchmarks. Like o1, R1 is trained to work through a simulated chain of thought process before providing an answer, which can potentially improve the accuracy or usefulness of the AI models' outputs for some types of questions posed by the user. That first part wasn't too surprising since other AI companieslike Googleare hot on the heels of OpenAI with their own simulated reasoning models. In addition, OpenAI itself hasannounced an upcoming SR model(dubbed \"o3\") that can surpass o1 in performance. There are three elements of DeepSeek R1 that really shocked experts. First, theChinese startupappears to have trained the model for only$6 million(reportedlyabout 3%of the cost of training o1) as a so-called \"side project\" while using less powerfulNvidia H800AI-acceleration chips due toUS export restrictionson cutting-edge GPUs. Secondly, it appeared just four months after OpenAI announced o1 in September 2024. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, DeepSeek released the model weights for free with an open MIT license, meaning anyone can download it, run it, and fine-tune (modify) it. It suddenly seemed to many observers on social media that American tech companies like OpenAI and Google—which have so far thrived on proprietary, closed models—have \"no moat,\" as tech insiders often say, which means that those companies' technological lead, access to cutting-edge hardware, or impressive bankrolls do not necessarily protect them from upstart market challengers. On Friday, venture capitalist Marc Andreessenwroteon X that DeepSeek R1 is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen\" and a \"profound gift to the world.\" The endorsement from the Andreessen Horowitz cofounder added fuel to the growing buzz around DeepSeek. On top of that, over the weekend,DeepSeek's app, which allows users to experiment with both the R1 model and the company's V3 conventional large language model (LLM) for free, shot to the top of the US iPhone App Store. Multiple AI-related Reddit threads have suddenly been plastered with DeepSeek-related posts, leading to so-farunfoundedaccusationsthat someone in China is astroturfing—pretending to be ordinary users but actually posting with an agenda to support something—to artificially drum up support for the Chinese AI company. Over the past weekend, social media has been overtaken with a sort of \"sky is falling\" in AI mentality, coupled with geopolitical angst about US economic rival China catching up with America, which perhaps inspired a measure of panic in big tech investors and led to the Nvidia stock sell-off, despite the fact that DeepSeek used Nvidia chips for training. As tempting as it is to frame this as a geopolitical tech battle, the \"US versus China\" framing has been overblown, according to some experts. On LinkedIn, Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun, who frequently champions open-weights AI models and open source AI research,wrote, \"To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think: 'China is surpassing the US in AI.' You are reading this wrong. The correct reading is: 'Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.'\" From the start, DeepSeek has claimed that R1 can match OpenAI's o1 model in AI benchmarks, but benchmarks have historically been easy to game and do not necessarily tell you much about how the models might be used in everyday scenarios. Over the past week, we have experimented with both DeepSeek-V3 (which is roughly the counterpart to OpenAI's GPT-4o), and DeepSeek-R1, and from informal testing, they both seem to be roughly equivalent to OpenAI's ChatGPT models, although that can vary dramatically based on how they are used and prompted. DeepSeek's AI assistant, which you can try atchat.deepseek.com, can also search the web like ChatGPT. We will likely evaluate R1 more formally in a future article. Ultimately, a cheaply trained open weights AI model that can match America's best commercial models is genuinely a threat to closed-source AI companies, but it should not be a surprise to anyone who has been watching the rapid rate of progress in AI. The history of computing is replete with examples of information technology getting cheaper and smaller, becoming a commodity, and eventually being absorbed as a component into larger products. Many software components of modern operating systems (including built-in apps, features, codecs, and utilities) wereonce separate productsthat retailed for thousands of dollars when they were first invented. Microprocessors supplanted massive, expensive computer systems and eventually becameembedded into everything. We suspect that AI models and software that processes data with simulated reasoning—even hypothetical human-level AI or beyond (if it is ever achieved)—will be no different. Tech companies come and go, the next new thing is created, and the cycle repeats itself. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "content": "3D-printed gun parts are worth real money on the black market. It's a truism at this point to say that Americans own a lot of guns. Case in point: This week, a fire chief in rural Alabamastopped to help a driver who had just hit a deer. The two men walked up the driveway of a nearby home. For reasons that remain unclear, a man came out of the house with a gun and started shooting. This was a bad idea on many levels, but most practically becauseboth the fire chief and the driver were also armed. Between the three of them, everyone got shot, the fire chief died, and the man who lived in the home was charged with murder. But despite the ease of acquiring legal weapons, a robust black market still exists to traffic in things like \"ghost guns\" (no serial numbers) andmachine gun converters(which make a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic). According to amajor new reportreleased this month by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, there was a 1,600 percent increase in the use of privately made \"ghost guns\" during crimes between 2017 and 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, the seizure of machine gun converters also increased by 784 percent. Ars Technica hascovered these issues for years, since both \"ghost guns\" and machine gun converters can be produced using 3D-printed parts, the schematics for which are now widely available online. But you can know about an issue and still be surprised when local prosecutors start talking about black market trafficking rings, inept burglary schemes, murder—and 3D printing operations being run out of a local apartment. I live in the Philadelphia area, and this is a real Philadelphia story; I know all of the places in it well. Many people in this story live in Philadelphia proper, but the violence (and the 3D printing!) they are accused of took place in the suburbs, in places like Jenkintown, Lower Merion township, and Bucks County. If you know Philly at all, you may know that these are all west and northwest suburban areas and that all of them are fairly comfortable places overall. Indeed, The New York Times ran a long story this month called \"How Sleepy Bucks County Became a Rival to the Hamptons.\" Lower Merion is one of the wealthier Philly suburbs, while Jenkintown is a charming little northwest suburb that was also the setting for the long-running sitcomThe Goldbergs.Local county prosecutors are more oftenbusting up shipments of fake Jason Kelce-autographed merchor going after—and laternot going after—comedian Bill Cosby. But today, prosecutors in Montgomery Countyannounced something different: they had cracked open a local 3D-printing black market gun ring—and said that one of the group's 3D-printed guns was used last month to murder a man during a botched burglary. It's a pretty bizarre story. As the police tell it, things began with 26-year-old Jeremy Fuentes driving north to a Bucks County address. Fuentes worked for a junk hauling company in nearby Willow Grove, and he had gone to Bucks County to give an estimate for a job. While the homeowner was showing Fuentes around the property, Fuentes allegedly noticed \"a large gun safe, multiple firearms boxes, gun parts and ammunition\" in the home. Outside of work, Fuentes was said to be a member of a local black market gun ring, and so when he saw this much gun gear in one spot—and when he noted that the homeowners were elderly—he saw dollar signs. Police say that after the estimate visit, Fuentes contacted Charles Fulforth, 41, of Jenkintown, who was a key member of the gun ring. Fuentes had an idea: Fulforth should rob the home and steal all the gun-related supplies. Unfortunately, the group was not great at directions. Fuentes didn't provide complete and correct information, so when Fulforth and an accomplice went to rob the home in December 2024, they drove to a Lower Merion home instead. This home was not in Bucks County at all—in fact, it was 30 minutes south—but it had a similar street address to the home Fuentes had visited. When they invaded the Lower Merion home on December 8, the two burglars found not an elderly couple but a 25-year-old man named Andrew Gaudio and his 61-year-old mother, Bernadette. Andrew was killed, while Bernadette was shot but survived. Police arrested Fulforth just three days later, on December 11, and they picked up his fellow burglar on December 17. But the cops didn't immediately realize just what they had stumbled into. Only after they searched Fulforth's Jenkintown apartment and found a 9 mm 3D-printed gun did they realize this might be more than a simple burglary. How had Fulforth acquired the weapon? According to astatement on the casereleased today by the Montgomery County District Attorney, the investigation involved \"search warrants on multiple locations and forensic searches of mobile phones,\" which revealed that Fulforth had his own \"firearm production facility\"—aka, \"a group of 3D printers.\" Detectives even found a video of aTaurus-stylegun part being printed on the devices, and they came to believe that the gun used to kill Andrew Gaudio was \"one of many manufactured by Fulforth.\" In addition to making ghost gun parts at his \"highly sophisticated, clandestine firearms production facility,\" Fulforth was also accused of making machine gun converters with 3D-printed parts. These parts would be preinstalled in the guns that the group was trafficking to raise their value. According to investigators, \"From the review of the captured cellphone communications among the gun trafficking members, the investigation found that when [machine gun conversion] switches were installed on AR pistols, it increased the price of the firearm by at least $1,000.\" Fuentes, who had initially provided the address that led to the murder, was arrested this morning. Authorities have also charged five others with being part of the gun ring. So, a tragic and stupid story, but one that highlights just how mainstream 3D-printing tech has become. No massive production facility or dimly lit warehouse is needed—just put a few printers in a bedroom and you, too, can become a local gun trafficking kingpin. There's nothing novel about any of this, and in fact, fewer people were shot than in that bizarre Alabama gun battle mentioned up top.

        "content": "Works with original PS1 accessories, and supports other MiSTer FPGA cores. Retro game enthusiasts may already be acquainted with Analogue, a company that designs and manufactures updated versions of classic consoles that can play original games but also be hooked up to modern televisions and monitors. The most recent of its announcements isthe Analogue 3D, a console designed to play Nintendo 64 cartridges. Now, a company called Retro Remake is reigniting the console wars of the 1990s with itsSuperStation one, a new-old game console designed to play original Sony PlayStation games and work with original accessories like controllers and memory cards. Currently availableas a $180 pre-order, Retro Remake expects the consoles to ship no later than Q4 of 2025. The base console is modeled on the redesigned PSOne console from mid-2000, released late in the console's lifecycle to appeal to buyers on a budget who couldn't afford a then-new PlayStation 2. The Superstation one includes two PlayStation controller ports and memory card slots on the front, plus a USB-A port. But there are lots of modern amenities on the back, including a USB-C port for power, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port for new TVs, DIN10 and VGA ports that support analog video output, and an Ethernet port. Other analog video outputs, including component and RCA outputs, are located on the sides behind small covers. The console also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The console won't play original game discs natively, but Retro Remake offers an optional tray-loading CD drive in a separate \"SuperDock\" accessory; it also includes an internal M.2 drive for an SSD and four additional USB-A ports. Buyers will have to put $5 down on the SuperDock now and pay whatever the final cost ends up being when the console ships (Retro Remake claims to be targeting a price of roughly $40). Like most Analogue consoles, the SuperStation uses an FPGA chip to emulate the original PlayStation's hardware rather than trying to emulate the console in software as most PC-based or Raspberry Pi-based retro consoles do. This has the benefit of reproducing all the quirks and oddities of the old hardware, making games run more accurately (and with lower input latency) than they do in software-based emulators. But unlike most of Analogue's consoles, the SuperStation supports installing and running other FPGA \"cores\" to re-create other consoles (think of FPGA cores like you'd think of software emulators—generally, you're going to need a separate one for every console you want to emulate). The SuperStation is based on the established MiSTer platform, which already hasa huge library of console and PC cores available, including but not limited to the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn. Retro Remake also says that being based on the MiSTer platform makes the console \"open source from day 1.\" Analogue has its own competing open source library of FPGA cores, calledOpenFPGA. But so far, the handheld Analogue Pocket is the only one of the company's consoles to support the initiative. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "content": "Rocket Lab announced it will soon launch a batch of eight German-owned wildfire-detection satellites. Welcome to Edition 7.28 of the Rocket Report! After last week's jam-packed action in the launch business, things are a bit quieter this week. Much of the space world's attention has turned to Washington as the Trump administration takes the helm of the federal government. Some of the administration's policy changes will likely impact the launch industry, with commercial spaceflight poised to become a beneficiary of actions over the next four years. As for the specifics, Ars has reported that NASA is expected to review the future of the Space Launch System rocket. Investments in the military space program could bring in more business for launch companies. And regulatory changes may reduce government oversight of commercial spaceflight. As always, wewelcome reader submissions. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. What happened to China's reusable rocket testbed?A Chinese state-owned company performed a rocket flight on January 18 (US time) aimed at testing reusable launch vehicle technology without announcing the outcome,Space News reports. The Longxing-2 test article lifted off from a makeshift launch area near Haiyang, Shandong province. The methane-fueled rocket was expected to fly to an altitude of 75 kilometers (about 246,000 feet) before performing a reentry burn and a landing burn to guide itself to a controlled splashdown in the Yellow Sea, replicating the maneuvers required to recover a reusable booster like the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9. This was China's most ambitious reusable rocket demonstration flight to date. State-sanctioned silence...Amateur footagenear the launch area showed the rocket rise slowly from the tower and perform an ascent phase with no apparent anomalies. But the video ended before the rocket descended to Earth, and there have been no official updates on the results of the test flight from the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST), the state-owned enterprise responsible for the demonstration. SAST published results and video footage of a previous reusable rocket demonstration to an altitude of 12 kilometers last year. The lack of official updates this time raises questions about the success of the test, which could indicate challenges during reentry or landing phases. (submitted by EllPeaTea) A timely launch for Rocket Lab.A dedicated flight of Rocket Lab's Electron launcher will soon deploy eight small spacecraft for a German company building a constellation of wildfire-monitoring satellites. Rocket Labannounced the deal Wednesday, saying the mission will launch from the company's spaceport in New Zealand. The eight satellites are owned by the German startup OroraTech. Rocket Lab said the launch will take place within \"just a few weeks,\" representing a relatively quick turnaround from contract signing to liftoff. This schedule will allow OroraTech to \"meet the season-sensitive requirements of its wildfire-detection mission,\" Rocket Lab said. Infrared eyes... OroraTech's satellites will host thermal infrared cameras to provide 24/7 monitoring of wildfires globally, supporting better and faster wildfire response to protect forests, people, and infrastructure, according to Rocket Lab. These eight satellites follow the launch of OroraTech's first three prototype wildfire-detection spacecraft since 2022. The company plans to expand its constellation with up to 100 satellites by 2028. While this launch isn't directly tied to the ongoing wildfire crisis in Southern California, OroraTech's mission highlights the role of space-based detection for future firefighters. (submitted by EllPeaTea) US green-lights space-related exports to Norway.The United States and Norway have signed an agreement to allow the export of American space hardware to Norway for launches there,Space News reports. The Technology Safeguards Agreement, or TSA, ensures the protection of US space technology exported to Norway. It allows for American satellites and potentially launch vehicles to operate from Andøya Spaceport, located on an island above the Arctic Circle in Norway. A valuable alliance... There are no US companies with publicly known plans to launch from Andøya, but the US military has touted the value of allies in funding, launching, and operating space-based platforms for communications, navigation, and reconnaissance. This agreement, announced on January 16 in the final days of the Biden administration, follows similar space tech transfer agreements with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The German rocket startup Isar Aerospace is scheduled to launch its first Spectrum rocket from the Norwegian spaceport as soon as this year. (submitted by EllPeaTea) Lunar lander test-fires uprated rocket engine.The Leros 4 rocket engine, developed by Nammo UK in Buckinghamshire, has successfully ignited in space, powering the Firefly Aerospace Blue Ghost lunar lander,European Spaceflight reports. This is a higher-thrust version of Nammo's flight-proven Leros engine design that has provided propulsion for NASA probes to the planets and for numerous telecommunications satellites. Like other engines in the Leros line, the Leros 4 consumes a bipropellant mix of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, which combust when coming into contact with one another. Thrusting toward the Moon... Firefly announced the successful main engine burn Sunday to begin raising the Blue Ghost spacecraft's orbit around the Earth. Subsequent burns will further raise the craft's altitude before eventually attaining enough speed to reach the Moon for a landing in early March. This is the first time a Leros 4 engine has fired in space. The variant flying on Blue Ghost is known as the \"Leros 4-Extra Thrust\" version, and it provides approximately 294 pounds of thrust (1,310 newtons), roughly double the power of Nammo's next-largest engine. It's designed specifically for interplanetary missions and is particularly well-suited for lunar landers because it can sustain thrust for lengthy burns or pulse at high frequency to control a spacecraft's descent rate toward the Moon's surface. Trump's DOT nominee says he'll review FAA's SpaceX fines.President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the US Transportation Department said he'd review penalties aviation regulators have proposed against SpaceX if confirmed for the role,Bloomberg reports. Transportation Secretary nominee Sean Duffy told senators during a hearing on January 15 that he'd also look into \"what's been happening at the FAA with regard to launches.\" Last year, the FAA proposedmore than $633,000 in fineson SpaceX due to alleged violations of the company's launch license associated with two flights of the company's Falcon 9 rocket from Florida. It is rare for the FAA's commercial spaceflight division to fine launch companies. It's about more than the money... In addition to the proposed fines related to SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Elon Musk's space company has also criticized regulators for taking too much time to review applications for launch licenses for the Starship mega-rocket. Some of the regulatory reviews were triggered by environmental concerns rather than public safety, which the FAA is responsible for ensuring during commercial rocket launches and reentries. Musk's close relationship with Trump has led to speculation that the FAA will now have a lighter touch with SpaceX. So far, there's no clear evidence of this happening, but it warrants observation. The FAA ordered a grounding of SpaceX's Starship rocket after a failure of a test flight on January 16, and there's been no announcement of a change in the agency's posture regarding this test flight. Falcon 9 flexes its muscles.SpaceX launched its latest batch of Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on Tuesday, and this time, the company set a new record by deploying 27 second-generation Starlinks on the same rocket,Spaceflight Now reports. The mission was delayed from Sunday after an aircraft strayed into a keep-out zone near the launch site. This launch included a new type of Starlink spacecraft bus, or chassis, called the Starlink V2 Mini Optimized version. These satellites are considerably lighter than the previous V2 Mini design but also debut upgrades, such as a new backhaul antenna with a SpaceX-designed and built dual-band chip and improved avionics, propulsion, and power systems. 29 at a time ...This means SpaceX can launch up to 29 Starlink V2 Mini Optimized satellites on a single Falcon 9 rocket. Before now, SpaceX never launched more than 24 V2 Mini satellites on a single flight. SpaceX has launched the V2 Mini satellite design since 2023. Initially, this design was supposed to be a stopgap until SpaceX began launching much larger Starlink V3 satellites on the Starship rocket. However, SpaceX has now launched more than 3,000 V2 Mini satellites, and the debut of the optimized version suggests SpaceX plans to keep the V2 Mini around for a while longer. Coming together in Kourou. ArianeGroup has shared that the core stage and two solid-fueled boosters for the second flight of the Ariane 6 rocket have been assembled on the ELA-4 launch pad at the Guiana Space Center in South America,European Spaceflight reports. At the same time, the flight’s payload, the French military CSO-3 spy satellite, arrived at Félix Eboué airport in French Guiana aboard an Antonov transport plane. With the launch campaign in full swing in French Guiana, it's likely that the liftoff of the second Ariane 6 flight is just a few weeks away. The most recent publicly available schedule showed the launch is slated for February 25, but this information is now a couple of months old. What it was made for …This launch follows the largely successful inaugural flight of Europe's Ariane 6 rocket last July, in which the launcher deployed multiple CubeSats into an on-target orbit, but faltered before completing a deorbit burn to maneuver the upper stage toward reentry. Nevertheless, European officials are confident the issue that caused the upper-stage problem last year will not affect the upcoming launch of the French military's newest surveillance satellite. This is the kind of mission the often-criticized Ariane 6 rocket was made for—launching a sensitive and costly European government payload to orbit with a European rocket from European territory.(submitted by EllPeaTea) Jan. 24:Falcon 9 | Starlink 11-6 | Vandenberg Space Force Base, California | 14:07 UTC Jan. 25:Long March 8A | Demo Flight | Wenchang Space Launch Site, China | 10:00 UTC Jan. 27:Falcon 9 | Starlink 12-7 | Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida | 19:21 UTC Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "content": "Nvidia last dropped Game Ready driver support for older GPUs in 2021. Nvidia is launching the first volley of RTX 50-series GPUs based on its new Blackwell architecture, starting with the RTX 5090 and working downward from there. The company also appears to be winding down support for a few of its older GPU architectures, according to theseCUDA release notesspotted byTom's Hardware. The release notes say that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPU architectures \"is considered feature-complete and will be frozen in an upcoming release.\" While all of these architectures—which collectively cover GeForce GPUs from the old GTX 700 series all the way up through 2016's GTX 1000 series, plus a couple of Quadro and Titan workstation cards—are still currently supported by Nvidia's December Game Ready driver package, the end of new CUDA feature support suggests that these GPUs will eventually be dropped from these driver packages soon. It's common for Nvidia and AMD to drop support for another batch of architectures all at once every few years; Nvidia last dropped support for older cardsin 2021, and AMD dropped support for several prominent GPUsin 2023. Both companies maintain a separate driver branch for some of their older cards, but releases usually only happen every few months, and they focus on security updates, not on providing new features or performance optimizations for new games. The Maxwell and Pascal architectures powered a few graphics cards that used to be a big deal. Those include the Maxwell-basedGeForce GTX 750 Ti, which was widely praised for keeping pace with AMD cards that used twice as much energy, and the Pascal-based GeForce GTX 1060, which was the single most popular graphics card model in the Steam Hardware Surveyfor over five years. (As of this writing, the GTX 1060 still occupies the no. 12 spot, above any GPU of any model or vintage from AMD or Intel.) We've asked Nvidia if it has anything to share about its plans for these older GPUs, and will update if we receive a response.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Drag optimization means it's very quiet inside, but it's also quite expensive. This year marks the return of the Jeep Wagoneer, which formerly served as a more luxurious version of the Cherokee but now hits the market as Jeep's first full EV. The challenge? How to merge the modern electric lifestyle with the outdoorsy, rugged ethos that defines Jeep as a brand, alongside the more recent addition of the internal-combustion Grand Wagoneer SUV's enormous luxury. First of all, the new Wagoneer S wound up much smaller in person than I expected. The overall profile falls more in line with the shape of mid-size electric crossovers including theKia EV6,Hyundai Ioniq 5,Chevrolet Equinox, and of course, Tesla's Model Y. But the interior volume belies that relatively compact exterior, with plenty of space for me at 6-foot 1-inch (185 cm) to sit comfortably in both the front and rear seats. Total cargo volumes of 30.6 cubic feet (866 L) with the second row up and 61 cubic feet (1,727 L) with the second row folded flat end up mattering less than the large floor footprint, because the height used to calculate those measurements drops with the low sloping roofline and rear window. Much of the interior space can be attributed to packaging of the Wagoneer EV's battery. Rather than going for all-out kilowatt-hours in a dedicated skateboard layout, Jeep instead used the Stellantis group's STLA Large platform, in this case stuffed with a 100.5-kWh lithium-ion pack built on 400 V architecture. That's enough for an EPA-estimated 303 miles of range (487 km), a solid figure but not a seriously impressive efficiency stat. In comparison, the world-beatingLucid Air Pure RWDmanages about 40 percent more range per kilowatt-hour, and aPolestar 3 AWDdoes about 18 percent worse. Claimed DC fast charge times of 23 minutes for a 20-80 percent top up, or 100 miles (160 km) in 10 minutes, similarly get the job done without standing out from the pack. Credit:\n\n          \n          Jeep That modular STLA Large chassis can house either a full internal-combustion engine, a hybrid powertrain, or fully electric components. The Wagoneer S uses two matching 335 hp (250 kW) motors, front and rear, for a combined 600 hp (447 kW) and 618 lb-ft of torque (838 Nm). In typical EV fashion, the latter comes on quick and makes this undoubtedly the fastest accelerating Jeep ever, as I learned while battling horrendous headwinds in fire-ravaged Southern California (which served as something of a nonstop reminder of the importance of taking baby steps, a la Jeep's first EV, toward a more sustainable transportation future). Pushing deep into the \"throttle\" pedal, the Wagoneer S will happily chirp all four tires in Sport mode. And the jerk thrusting my torso and skull back into the plush seat suggests that Jeep's claimed 0–60 mph time of 3.4 seconds might just be accurate, potentially thanks to being able to do a true launch by stepping on the brake and gas pedals simultaneously—possible because Jeep chose to retain more standard mechanical brakes rather than a brake-by-wire system as on the EV6/Ioniq siblings and Model Y. The suspension tuning definitely trends toward the typical tautness of today's crossover segment, where aspirational sporty dynamics can sometimes create harsh and uncomfortable ride quality. But I still might have ventured to call the Wagoneer S somewhat softer than most of the competition, until the roughest of roads revealed the 5,667 lb (2,570 kg) curb weight. For an EV, that figure falls roughly in the middle of the pack, but this crossover weighs about as much as a full-size internal-combustion three-row SUV. Still, even at highway speeds (in gale-force winds) or on those roughest of roads, the Wagoneer S remains shockingly quiet. And not just to enhance the experience of the Wagoneer S Launch Edition's 1,200 W McIntosh sound system. Instead, Jeep exterior designer Vince Galante walked me through the design process, which kicked off with a targeted 0.30 coefficient of drag despite the need to stick with a squared-off, upright SUV posture typical of Jeeps throughout history. \"On the exterior design portion, the aerodynamic drag is our biggest contributor,\" Galante told me. \"It kind of comes up off the hood, up the A pillar, and tapers down towards the back, and finishes in a square, yet tapered, pillar reminiscent of the original Wagoneer. But through the middle of the car, it's basically ideal for what the wind wants to do.\" From the front or side perspective, this Wagoneer looks almost as boxy as a 1980s Jeep. But a rear viewing angle reveals the massive rear wing creating that illusion, which sits well off the sloping line of the rear roof and glass. Credit:\n\n          \n          Michael Teo Van Runkle \"Any time we do a floating element, we think 'Yeah, there's no way engineering's gonna let us get away with this,'\" Galante laughed. \"We work really collaboratively with the engineers, and they were like, 'Let's test it. Let's see what it does.' And they came back and said, 'You know, yeah, this has potential. But you guys gotta make it sit off the surface three times more dramatically.'\" Galante estimates the original wing design rose up 2 inches, while the final production version is more like 9 inches off the rear window. He also pointed out a host of other less obvious details, from body panels that step in by fractions of millimeters to differently rounded radii of wheel arch edges, and especially the confluence where the A pillar connects to the body. \"The windshield, the A pillar, the side glass, the mirror, the post that holds the mirror, the fender, everything comes together there,\" he said. \"I think every vehicle I've ever worked on, that was the last thing to finalize in the wind tunnel… I mean, we're talking tenths of millimeters for some of the iterations that we're doing in those areas. Especially the front edge of the A pillar, I can recall trying 20, 30, 40 different radii on there to get that just right.\" Credit:\n\n          \n          Michael Teo Van Runkle All the aero considerations attempt to coax air to stick to surfaces, then break off suddenly and evenly. The rear wing therefore pushes air down toward the rear window, while creating as little turbulence as possible. The final range figure critically—and barely—cracking 300 miles justified so much refinement in Jeep's new rolling road wind tunnel, thanks to a final Cd of 0.294. Maybe juggling production cost savings of the STLA Large platform dictated such extensive aerodynamic efforts more than a dedicated skateboard battery layout might have, but the resulting quietude that combating those inefficiencies produced does truly border on a luxury experience, even if we're not quite at Audi (or Lucid) levels of silence. On the interior, Jeep also tried to lean into the Wagoneer S' sustainability, using quality materials with textural designs and as little piano-black plastic as possible. The fabrics, plastics, and aluminum trim come almost entirely from recycled sources—62 percent for suede and 100 percent for fabric and carpeting, in fact—and you'll see zero chrome anywhere on the car, since chroming is apparently one of the most environmentally deleterious processes in all of automaking. But the Wagoneer S similarly leans into a tech-heavy user experience, with almost 55 inches of screen visible from the front seats: the gauge cluster, center infotainment, climate controls, passenger dash screen, and digital rearview mirror all contribute to that total. Climate control, especially, seems critical—and an often overlooked element for many EV manufacturers. Rather than a full panoramic glass roof, as on the Lucids and Polestars of the world, this Jeep gets a long sunroof with a retracting insulated cover to keep out heat. The excellent ventilated front and rear seats (and massaging, for the fronts!) also more efficiently cool down passengers. For my taste, the digitalization of driving went a little too far. I never enjoy a rotating shift knob, but this one clicks into gear with a positive heft. I also noticed some pixelation and latency in the gauge cluster's navigation maps, as if the refresh rate was too slow for the speed I was driving. Not that I started ripping up the road too much in this luxury crossover, or at least, not more than scientific experimentation demanded (and a similar problem also affectedthe Dodge Charger EVwe drove recently). Sport mode brought out some of my inner grinning child, but I actually preferred the Wagoneer S in Eco mode. So much power split to the front and rear wheels can create some torque steer and throttle response that borders on touchy. The electrically assisted steering also prioritizes a heavy on-center zone, then snaps to light inputs with the slightest turn of the wheel, which made holding a steady line slightly distracting. Instead, Eco dulls down the throttle response, and the steering becomes a bit less reactive. The Wagoneer S will then also more regularly disconnect the front wheels for improved efficiency—though at the hubs, rather than the axles, so some reciprocating mass still saps precious electrons. It would be more efficient to disconnect the rears, but this decision also centers around maintaining some semblance of Jeep-ness, although the Wagoneer S aligns most closely with recent Cherokee and Grand Cherokee models, rather than the off-roady Wrangler and Gladiator or the super-luxe Grand Wagoneer. The forthcoming Trailhawk version promises to double down on the 4x4 capability, with a locking rear differential, better tires, and hopefully better suspension than I experienced on a quick sojourn off the asphalt onto a slightly rutted gravel road east of San Diego. More importantly, cheaper trims will arrive later in 2025, which is wise, because the Launch Edition's tall ask of $71,995 almost doubles the starting sticker of an Equinox EV, seriously eclipses either a Model Y, EV6, or Ioniq 5, and also somehow costs more than a Polestar 3 or even a Lucid Air. Jeep so far wants to keep pricing for those lower-spec Wagoneer EVs under wraps, though, even if the heart of the run will undoubtedly help the first electric Jeep more effectively escape from unfortunate comparisons to such stiff competition.

        "content": "Brendan Carr dumps plan to ban bulk billing deals that lock renters into one ISP. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has dropped the previous administration's proposal to ban bulk billing deals that require tenants to pay for a specific provider's Internet service. In March 2024, then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcelproposeda ban on arrangements in which \"tenants are required to pay for broadband, cable, and satellite service provided by a specific communications provider, even if they do not wish to take the service or would prefer to use another provider.\" Rosenworcel's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was opposed by Internet providers and sat on the FCC's list of items on circulationthroughout 2024without any final vote, despite the commission having a 3–2 Democratic majority at the time. Carr, who was elevated to the chairmanship by President Trump, emptied thelist of itemsunder consideration by commissioners on Friday. With bulk billing deals in which a company agrees to provide service to every tenant of a building, residents are billed a prorated share of the total cost. Tenants may be billed by either the landlord or the telco provider.Bulk billing contracts areonly bannedby the FCC when they give a provider the exclusive right to access and serve a building. But when tenants are forced to pay for one provider's service, other providers aren't likely to see much opportunity in entering the building. Technically, Rosenworcel's plan would have allowed bulk billing arrangements to continue as long as tenants are given the ability to opt out of them. In March, Rosenworcel's office said her plan would \"increase competition for communications service in these buildings by making it more profitable for competitive providers to deploy service in buildings where it is currently too expensive to serve consumers because tenants are required to take a certain provider's service.\" \"Too often, tenants living in these households are forced to pay high prices with limited choices for Internet or other services,\" Rosenworcel's office said in March, arguing that her plan would \"lower costs and address the lack of choice for broadband services\" in apartments, condos, and public housing. Housing industry lobby groups praised Carr in apress releaseissued by the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), National Apartment Association (NAA), and Real Estate Technology and Transformation Center (RETTC). \"His decision to withdraw the proposal will ensure that millions of consumers—renters, homeowners and condominium owners—will continue to reap the benefits of bulk billing,\" the press release said. The industry press release claims that bulk billing agreements negotiated between property owners and Internet service providers \"typically secur[e] high-speed Internet for renters at rates up to 50 percent lower than standard retail pricing\" and remove \"barriers to broadband adoption like credit checks, security deposits, equipment rentals, or installation fees.\" \"Bulk billing arrangements have made high-speed internet more accessible and affordable for millions of Americans, especially for low-income renters and seniors living in affordable housing,\" NMHC President Sharon Wilson Géno said. While the FCC prohibits deals in which a service provider has the exclusive right to access and serve a building, there are other ways in which competitors can be effectively shut out of buildings. In 2022, the FCC said its existing rules weren't strong enough and added aban on exclusive revenue-sharing agreementsbetween landlords and ISPs in multi-tenant buildings. The revenue-sharing ban was approved 4–0, including votes from both Rosenworcel and Carr. Comcast, Charter, Cox, and cable lobby group NCTAopposed Rosenworcel's planfor a bulk billing ban, saying that \"interfering with the ability of building owners to offer these arrangements to their tenants will result in higher broadband and video prices and other harms for consumers, with questionable and limited benefits.\" Carr issued a statement today, saying, \"During the Biden-Harris Administration, FCC leadership put forward a 'bulk billing' proposal that could have raised the price of Internet service for Americans living in apartments by as much as 50 percent. This regulatory overreach from Washington would have hit families right in their pocketbooks at a time when they were already hurting from the last administration's inflationary policies. That is why you saw a broad and bipartisan coalition of groups opposing the plan. After all, seniors, students, and low-income individuals would have been hit particularly hard.\" Carr also said that he plans more actions \"to reverse the last administration's costly regulatory overreach.\" Consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and 30 other groupsurged the FCCto approve Rosenworcel's proposal in July. \"As they exist now, bulk billing arrangements sacrifice consumer choice to preserve in-building monopolies at the expense of tenants,\" the groups said in a letter to the commission. \"For the many tenants trapped with high-cost or less-capable Internet that does not meet their needs, an opt-out option provides a vital escape. This is especially true for those eligible for low-income plans or Lifeline subsidy, which by definition are not available in a bulk billing arrangement.\" Because Rosenworcel's plan was in the form of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FCC would have sought public comments before making a final decision. \"The best way to determine whether bulk billing does more harm or more good, whether providers genuinely need 100 percent sign up to make service viable, or other questions as to whether allowing opt out better serves the public by offering more competition, is to move forward with the item,\" the advocacy groups' letter said. John Bergmayer, legal director at Public Knowledge, told Ars today that a bulk billing ban would have made the commission's rules more effective \"by eliminating one of the ways that landlords, HOAs, and telecom and cable companies collaborate to bypass the intended effort of those rules, and require people to pay for Internet service they don't want or need. It's a shame. The arguments on the pro-bulk-billing side were spurious or overblown, and the MTE [multiple tenant environments] access rules have broad, bipartisan support, as well as a lot of industry support.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Even setting aside Frame Generation, this is a fast, power-hungry $2,000 GPU. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 starts at $1,999 before you factor in upsells from the company's partners or price increases driven by scalpers and/or genuine demand. It costs more than my entire gaming PC. The new GPU is so expensive that you could build an entire well-specced gaming PC with Nvidia's next-fastest GPU in it—the $999 RTX 5080, which we don't have in hand yet—for the same money, or maybe even a little less with judicious component selection. It's not the most expensive GPU that Nvidia has ever launched—2018's $2,499 Titan RTX has it beat, and 2022's RTX 3090 Ti also cost $2,000—but it's safe to say it's not really a GPU intended for the masses. At least as far as gaming is concerned, the 5090 is the very definition of a halo product; it's for people who demand the best and newest thing regardless of what it costs (the calculus is probably different for deep-pocketed people and companies who want to use them as some kind of generative AI accelerator). And on this front, at least, the 5090 is successful. It's the newest and fastest GPU you can buy, and the competition is not particularly close. It's also a showcase for DLSS Multi-Frame Generation, a new feature unique to the 50-series cards that Nvidia is leaning on heavily to make its new GPUs look better than they already are. We won’t spend too long talking about the specific designs of Nvidia’s Founders Edition cards since many buyers will experience the Blackwell GPUs with cards from Nvidia’s partners instead (the cards we’ve seen so far mostly look like the expected fare: gargantuan triple-slot triple-fan coolers, with varying degrees of RGB). But it's worth noting that Nvidia has addressed a couple of my functional gripes with the 4090/4080-series design. The first was the sheer dimensions of each card—not an issue unique to Nvidia, but one that frequently caused problems for me as someone who tends toward ITX-based PCs and smaller builds. The 5090 and 5080 FE designs are the same length and height as the 4090 and 4080 FE designs, but they only take up two slots instead of three, which will make them an easier fit for many cases. Nvidia has also tweaked the cards’ 12VHPWR connector, recessing it into the card and mounting it at a slight angle instead of having it sticking straight out of the top edge. The height of the 4090/4080 FE design made some cases hard to close up once you factored in the additional height of a 12VHPWR cable or Nvidia’s many-tentacled 8-pin-to-12VHPWR adapter. The angled connector still extends a bit beyond the top of the card, but it’s easier to tuck the cable away so you can put the side back on your case. Finally, Nvidia has changed its cooler—whereas most OEM GPUs mount all their fans on the top of the GPU, Nvidia has historically placed one fan on each side of the card. In a standard ATX case with the GPU mounted parallel to the bottom of the case, this wasn’t ahugedeal—there’s plenty of room for that air to circulate inside the case and to be expelled by whatever case fans you have installed. But in “sandwich-style” ITX cases, where a riser cable wraps around so the GPU can be mounted parallel to the motherboard, the fan on the bottom side of the GPU was poorly placed. In many sandwich-style cases, the GPU fan will dump heat against the back of the motherboard, making it harder to keep the GPU cool and creating heat problems elsewhere besides. The new GPUs mount both fans on the top of the cards. Nvidia’s Founders Edition cardshave had heat issues in the past—most notably the 30-series GPUs—and that was my first question going in. A smaller cooler plus a dramatically higher peak power draw seems like a recipe for overheating. At least for the 5090, the smaller cooler does mean higher temperatures—around 10 to 12 degrees Celsius higher when running the same benchmarks as the RTX 4090 Founders Edition. And while temperatures of around 77 degrees aren’t hugely concerning, this is sort of a best-case scenario, with an adequately cooled testbed case with the side panel totally removed and ambient temperatures at around 21° or 22° Celsius. You’ll just want to make sure you have a good amount of airflow in your case if you buy one of these. A new high-end Nvidia GPU is a good reason to tweak our test bed and suite of games, and we’ve done both here. Mainly, we addeda 1050 W Thermaltake Toughpower GF A3 power supply—Nvidia recommends at least 1000 W for the 5090, and this one has a native 12VHPWR connector for convenience. We’ve also swapped the Ryzen 7 7800X3D for a slightly faster Ryzen 7 9800X3D to reduce the odds that the CPU will bottleneck performance as we try to hit high frame rates. As for the suite of games, we’ve removed a couple of older titles and added some with built-in benchmarks that will tax these GPUs a bit more, especially at 4K with all the settings turned up. Those games include the RT Overdrive preset in the perennially punishingCyberpunk 2077andBlack Myth: Wukongin Cinematic mode, both games where even the RTX 4090 struggles to hit 60 fps without an assist from DLSS. We’ve also addedHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered, a recent release that doesn’t include ray-tracing effects but does support most DLSS 3 and FSR 3 features (including FSR Frame Generation). We’ve tried to strike a balance between games with ray-tracing effects and games without it, though most AAA games these days include it, and modern GPUs should be able to handle it well (best of luck to AMD with its upcoming RDNA 4 cards). For the 5090, we've run all tests in 4K—if you don't care about running games in 4K, even if you want super-high frame rates at 1440p or for some kind of ultrawide monitor, the 5090 is probably overkill. When we run upscaling tests, we use the newest DLSS version available for Nvidia cards, the newest FSR version available for AMD cards, and the newest XeSS version available for Intel cards (not relevant here, just stating for the record), and we use the \"Quality\" setting (at 4K, that equates to an actual rendering version of 1440p). Before we talk about Frame Generation or \"fake frames,\" let's compare apples to apples and just examine the 5090's rendering performance. The card mainly benefits from four things compared to the 4090: the updated Blackwell GPU architecture, a nearly 33 percent increase in the number of CUDA cores, an upgrade from GDDR6X to GDDR7, and a move from a 384-bit memory bus to a 512-bit bus. It also jumps from 24GB of RAM to 32GB, but games generally aren't butting up against a 24GB limit yet, so the capacity increase by itself shouldn't really change performance if all you're focused on is gaming. And for people who prioritize performance over all else, the 5090 is a big deal—it's the first consumer graphics card from any company that is faster than a 4090, as Nvidia never spruced up the 4090 last year when it did its mid-generation Super refreshes of the 4080, 4070 Ti, and 4070. Comparing natively rendered games at 4K, the 5090 is between 17 percent and 40 percent faster than the 4090, with most of the games we tested landing somewhere in the low to high 30 percent range. That's an undeniably big bump, one that's roughly commensurate with the increase in the number of CUDA cores. Tests run with DLSS enabled (both upscaling-only and with Frame Generation running in 2x mode) improve by roughly the same amount. You could find things to be disappointed about if you went looking for them. That 30-something-percent performance increase comes with a 35 percent increase in power use in our testing under load with punishing 4K games—the 4090 tops out around 420 W, whereas the 5090 went all the way up to 573 W, with the 5090 coming closer to its 575 W TDP than the 4090 does to its theoretical 450 W maximum. The 50-series cards use the same TSMC 4N manufacturing process as the 40-series cards, and increasing the number of transistors without changing the process results in a chip that uses more power (though it should be said that capping frame rates, running at lower resolutions, or running less-demanding games can rein in that power use a bit). The 5090's 30-something percent increase over the 4090 might also seem underwhelming if you recall that the 4090was around 55 percent fasterthan the previous-generation 3090 Ti while consuming about the same amount of power. To beeven fasterthan a 4090 is no small feat—AMD's fastest GPU is more in line with Nvidia's 4080 Super—but if you're comparing the two cards using the exact same tests, the relative leap is less seismic. That brings us to Nvidia's answer for that problem: DLSS 4 and its Multi-Frame Generation feature. As a refresher, Nvidia's DLSS Frame Generation feature, as introduced in the GeForce 40-series, takes DLSS upscaling one step further. The upscaling feature inserted interpolated pixels into a rendered image to make it look like a sharper, higher-resolution image without having to do all the work of rendering all those pixels. DLSS FG would interpolate an entire frame between rendered frames, boosting your FPS without dramatically boosting the amount of work your GPU was doing. If you used DLSS upscaling and FG at the same time, Nvidia could claim that seven out of eight pixels on your screen were generated by AI. DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (hereafter MFG, for simplicity's sake) does the same thing, but it can generate one to three interpolated frames for every rendered frame. The marketing numbers have gone up, too; now, 15 out of every 16 pixels on your screen can be generated by AI. Nvidia provided reviewers with a preview build ofCyberpunk 2077with DLSS MFG enabled, which gives us an example of how those settings will be exposed to users. For 40-series cards that only support the regular DLSS FG, you won't notice a difference in games that support MFG—Frame Generation is still just one toggle you can turn on or off. For 50-series cards that support MFG, you'll be able to choose from among a few options, just as you currently can with other DLSS quality settings. The “2x” mode is the old version of DLSS FG and is supported by both the 50-series cards and 40-series GPUs; it promises one generated frame for every rendered frame (two frames total, hence \"2x\"). The “3x” and “4x” modes are new to the 50-series and promise two and three generated frames (respectively) for every rendered frame. Like the original DLSS FG, MFG can be used in concert with normal DLSS upscaling, or it can be used independently. One problem with the original DLSS FG was latency—user input was only being sampled at the natively rendered frame rate, meaning you could be looking at 60 frames per second on your display but only having your input polled 30 times per second. Another is image quality; as good as the DLSS algorithms can be at guessing and recreating what a natively rendered pixel would look like, you'll inevitably see errors, particularly in fine details. Both these problems contribute to the third problem with DLSS FG: Without a decent underlying frame rate, the lag you feel and the weird visual artifacts you notice will both be more pronounced. So DLSS FG can be useful for turning 120 fps into 240 fps, or even 60 fps into 120 fps. But it's not as helpful if you're trying to get from 20 or 30 fps up to a smooth 60 fps. We'll be taking a closer look at the DLSS upgrades in the next couple of weeks (including MFG and the new transformer model, which will supposedly increase upscaling quality and supports all RTX GPUs). But in our limited testing so far, the issues with DLSS MFG are basically the same as with the first version of Frame Generation, just slightly more pronounced. In the built-inCyberpunk 2077benchmark, the most visible issues are with some bits of barbed-wire fencing, which get smoother-looking and less detailed as you crank up the number of AI-generated frames. But the motiondoeslook fluid and smooth, and the frame rate counts are admittedly impressive. But as we noted in last year's 4090 review, the xx90 cards portray FG and MFG in the best light possible since the card is already capable of natively rendering such high frame rates. It's on lower-end cards where the shortcomings of the technology become more pronounced. Nvidia might say that the upcoming RTX 5070 is \"as fast as a 4090 for $549,\" and it might be right in terms of the number of frames the card can put up on your screen every second. But responsiveness and visual fidelity on the 4090 will be better every time—AI is a good augmentation for rendered frames, but it's iffy as areplacementfor rendered frames. The GeForce RTX 5090 is an impressive card—it's the only consumer graphics card to be released in over two years that can outperform the RTX 4090. The main caveats are its sky-high power consumption and sky-high price; by itself, it costs as much (and consumes as much power as) an entire mainstream gaming PC. The card is aimed at people who care about speed way more than they care about price, but it's still worth putting it into context. The main controversy, as with the 40-series, is how Nvidia talks about its Frame Generation-inflated performance numbers. Frame Generation and Multi-Frame Generation are tools in a toolbox—there will be games where they make things look great and run fast with minimal noticeable impact to visual quality or responsiveness, games where those impacts are more noticeable, and games that never add support for the features at all. (As well-supported as DLSS generally is in new releases, itisincumbent upon game developers to add it—and update it when Nvidia puts out a new version.) But using those Multi-Frame Generation-inflated FPS numbers to make topline comparisons to last-generation graphics cards just feels disingenuous. No, an RTX 5070 will not be as fast as an RTX 4090 for just $549, because not all games support DLSS MFG, and not all games thatdosupport it will run it well. Frame Generation still needs a good base frame rate to start with, and the slower your card is, the more issues you might notice. Fuzzy marketing aside, Nvidia is still the undisputed leader in the GPU market, and the RTX 5090 extends that leadership for what will likely be another entire GPU generation, since bothAMDandIntelare focusing their efforts on higher-volume, lower-cost cards right now. DLSS is still generally better than AMD's FSR, and Nvidia does a good job of getting developers of new AAA game releases to support it. And if you're buying this GPU to do some kind of rendering work or generative AI acceleration, Nvidia's performance and software tools are still superior. The misleading performance claims are frustrating, but Nvidia still gains a lot of real advantages from being as dominant and entrenched as it is.

        "content": "ByteDance apparently sees several non-sale options as Trump mulls resolution. TikTok owner ByteDance isreportedlystill searching for non-sale options to stay in the US after theSupreme Court upheld a national security lawrequiring that TikTok's US operations either be shut down or sold to a non-foreign adversary. Last weekend, TikTok briefly went dark in the US,only to come back online hours laterafter Donald Trump reassured ByteDance that the US law would not be enforced. Then, shortly after Trump took office, hesigned an executive orderdelaying enforcement for 75 days while he consulted with advisers to \"pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans.\" Trump's executive order did not suggest that he intended to attempt to override the national security law's ban-or-sale requirements. But that hasn't stopped ByteDance, board member Bill Ford told World Economic Forum (WEF) attendees, from searching for a potential non-sale option that \"could involve a change of control locally to ensure it complies with US legislation,\" Bloombergreported. It's currently unclear how ByteDance could negotiate a non-sale option without facing a ban. Joe Biden's extended efforts throughProject Texasto keep US TikTok data out of China-controlled ByteDance's hands without forcing a sale dead-ended, prompting Congress to pass the national security law requiring a ban or sale. At the WEF, Ford said that the ByteDance board is \"optimistic we will find a solution\" that avoids ByteDance giving up a significant chunk of TikTok's operations. \"There are a number of alternatives we can talk to President Trump and his team about that are short of selling the company that allow the company to continue to operate, maybe with a change of control of some kind, but short of having to sell,\" Ford said. Ford also said that he was \"optimistic\" about Trump's \"emerging\" dialog with China's president, Xi Jinping. While tensions between the US and China remain—Trump recentlyrenewed his threats to impose new tariffs—the US president also hopes topersuade China to reduce its nuclear stockpile, andChina reportedly hopes that an attractive TikTok deal will be a bargaining chipto ease some of those tensions. Soon after taking office, Trump endorsed the idea of selling TikTok to a US tech billionairelike Elon Muskor Larry Ellison, Bloombergreported. Trump has not yet indicated whether he'd be open to TikTok staying under ByteDance's control, but a clash with Musk might sully his potential candidacy as the US buyer Trump would find most appealing. On Thursday, Trump and Musk seemed to publicly butt heads over Trump's$500 billion plan to launch a Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure projectthrough a joint investment with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. Trump called the investment “a resounding declaration of confidence in America’s potential” to become a global AI leader. But on X (formerly Twitter), Musk questioned the investment,writingthat he had it on\"good authority\"that “they don’t actually have the money. SoftBank has well under $10B secured.\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pushed back,callingMusk \"wrong,\" inviting him to visit the project site, and accusing Musk of failing to always put America \"first.\" (The billionaires are currentlyduking it out in a lawsuitwhere Musk has accused Altman of abandoning OpenAI's mission to make AI for the public good, withMusk actively trying to stop OpenAI from transitioning into a for-profit company.)

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Optimum wasn't ready to comply with law, rejected low-income man's request twice. When New York's law requiring $15 or $20 broadband plans for people with low incomes took effect last week, Optimum customer William O'Brien tried to sign up for the cheap Internet service. Since O'Brien is in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), he qualifies for one of the affordable plans that Internet service providers must offer New Yorkers who meet income eligibility requirements. O'Brien has been paying Optimum $111.20 a month for broadband—$89.99 for the broadband service, $14 in equipment rental fees, a $6 \"Network Enhancement Fee,\" and $1.21 in tax. He was due for a big discount under theNew York Affordable Broadband Act (ABA), which says that any ISP with over 20,000 customers must offer either a $15 plan with download speeds of at least 25Mbps or a $20 plan with at least 200Mbps speeds, and that the price must include \"any recurring taxes and fees such as recurring rental fees for service provider equipment required to obtain broadband service and usage fees.\" Despite qualifying for a low-income plan under the law's criteria, O'Brien's request was denied by Optimum. He reached out to Ars, just like many other people who have read our articles about bad telecom customer service. Usually, these problems are fixed quickly after we reach out to an Internet provider's public relations department on the customer's behalf. That seemed to be the way it was going, as Optimum's PR team admitted the mistake and told us that a customer relations specialist would reach out to O'Brien and get him on the right plan. But O'Brien was rejectedagainafter that. We followed up with Optimum's PR team, and they had to intervene a second time to make sure the company gave O'Brien what he's entitled to under the law. The company also updated its marketing materials after we pointed out that itsOptimum Advantage Internetwebpage still said the low-income plan wasn't available to current customers, former users who disconnected less than 60 days ago, and former customers whose accounts were \"not in good standing.\" The New York law doesn't allow for those kinds of exceptions. O'Brien is now on a $14.99 plan with 50Mbps download and 5Mbps upload speeds. He was previously on a 100Mbps download plan and had faster upload speeds, but from now on he'll be paying nearly $100 less a month. Obviously, telecom customers shouldn't ever have to contact a news organization just to get a basic problem solved. But the specter of media coverage usually causes an ISP to take quick action, so it was surprising when O'Brien was rejected a second time. Here's what happened. O'Brien contacted Optimum (which used to be called Cablevision and is now owned by Altice USA) after learning about the New York law froman Ars article. \"I immediately got on Optimum's website to chat with live support but they refused to comply with the act,\" O'Brien told us on January 15, the day the law took effect. A transcript of O'Brien's January 15 chat with Optimum shows that the customer service agent told him, \"I did check on that and according to the policy we don't have that credit offer in Optimum right now.\" O'Brien provided the agent a link to the Ars article, which described the New York law and mentioned that Optimum offers a low-income plan for $15. \"After careful review, I did check on that, it is not officially from Optimum and in Optimum we don't have that plan,\" the agent replied. O'Brien provided Ars with documents showing that he is in SNAP and thus qualifies for the low-income plan. We provided this information to the Optimum PR department on the morning of January 17. \"We have escalated this exchange with our teams internally to ensure this issue is rectified and will be reaching out to the customer directly today to assist in getting him on the right plan,\" an Optimum spokesperson told us that afternoon. A specialist from Optimum's executive customer relations squad reached out to O'Brien later on Friday. He missed the call, but they connected on Tuesday, January 21. She told O'Brien that Optimum doesn't offer the low-income plan to existing customers. \"She said their position is that they offer the required service but only for new customers and since I already have service I'm disqualified,\" O'Brien told us. \"I told her that I'm currently on food stamps and that I used to receive the$30 a month COVID creditbut this did not matter. She claimed that since Optimum offers a $15, 50Mbps service... that they are in compliance with the law.\" Shortly after the call, the specialist sent O'Brien an email reiterating that he wasn't eligible, which he shared with Ars. \"As discussed prior to this notification, Optimum offers a low-income service for $15.00. However, we were unable to change the account to that service because it is an active account with the service,\" she wrote. We contacted Optimum's PR team again after getting this update from O'Brien. On Tuesday evening, the specialist from executive customer relations emailed O'Brien to say, \"The matter was reviewed, and I was advised that I could upgrade the account.\" After another conversation with the specialist on Wednesday, O'Brien had the $15 plan. O'Brien told us that he \"asked why I had to fight tooth and nail for this\" and why he had to contact a news organization to get it resolved. \"I claimed that it's almost like no one there has read the legislation, and it was complete silence,\" he told us. On Wednesday this week, the Optimum spokesperson told us that \"it seems that there has been some confusion among our care teams on the implementation of the ABA over the last week and how it should be correctly applied to our existing low-cost offers.\" Optimum has offered its low-cost plan for several years, with the previously mentioned restrictions that limit it to new customers. Theplan websitewasn't updated in time for the New York law, but now says that \"new and existing residential Internet customers in New York\" qualify. The new-customer restriction still applies elsewhere. \"Our materials have been updated, including all internal documents and trainings, in addition to our external website,\" Optimum told us on Wednesday this week. Broadband lobby groups convinced a federal judge toblock the New York affordability lawin 2021, but a US appeals courtreversed the rulingin April 2024. The Supreme Courtdecided not to hearthe case in mid-December, allowing the law to take effect. New York had agreed to delay enforcement until 30 days after the case's final resolution, which meant that it took effect on January 15. The state issued anorderon January 9 reminding ISPs that they had to comply. \"We have been working as fast as we can to update all of our internal and external materials since the ABA was implemented only last week—there was quite a fast turnaround between state officials notifying us of the intended implementation date and pushing this live,\" Optimum told Ars. AT&T decided tocompletely stop offeringits 5G home Internet service in New York instead of complying with the state law. The law doesn't affect smartphone service, and AT&T doesn't offer wired home Internet in New York. Optimum told us it plans to market its low-income plan \"more broadly and conduct additional outreach in low-income areas to educate customers and prospects of this offer. We want to make sure that those eligible for this plan know about it and sign up.\" O'Brien was disappointed that he couldn't get a faster service plan. As noted earlier, the New York law lets ISPs comply with either a $15 plan with download speeds of at least 25Mbps or a $20 plan with at least 200Mbps speeds. ISPs don't have to offer both. \"I did ask about 200Mbps service, but they said they are not offering that,\" he said. Optimum offers a$25 planwith 100Mbps speeds for low-income users. But even in New York, that one still isn't available to customers who were already subscribed to any other plan. Failure to comply with the New York law can be punished with civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation. The state attorney general can sue Internet providers to enforce the law. O'Brien said he intended to file a complaint against Optimum with the AG and is still hoping to get a 200Mbps plan. We contacted Attorney General Letitia James' office on Wednesday to ask about plans for enforcing the law and whether the office has received any complaints so far, but we haven't gotten a response.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "J-Magic backdoor infected organizations in a wide array of industries. When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can’t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that. J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key. The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumen Technology’s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice. “While this is not the first discovery of magic packet malware, there have only been a handful of campaigns in recent years,” the researcherswrote. “The combination of targeting Junos OS routers that serve as a VPN gateway and deploying a passive listening in-memory only agent, makes this an interesting confluence of tradecraft worthy of further observation.” The researchers found J-Magic onVirusTotaland determined that it had run inside the networks of 36 organizations. They still don’t know how the backdoor got installed. Here’s how the magic packet worked: The passive agent is deployed to quietly observe all TCP traffic sent to the device. It discreetly analyzes the incoming packets and watches for one of five specific sets of data contained in them. The conditions are obscure enough to blend in with the normal flow of traffic that network defense products won’t detect a threat. At the same time, they’re unusual enough that they’re not likely to be found in normal traffic. Those conditions are: Condition 1: Condition 2: Condition 3: Condition 4: Condition 5: Black Lotus Labs wrote: If any of the remote IP addresses match on one of the five predefined conditions above, it moves to spawn a reverse shell. The reverse_shell function forks, creating a child process and renames it to [nfsiod 1]. Next it enters a loop that will connect back to the IP and port retrieved from the packet filter, using SSL. It creates a random alphanumeric string that is five characters long. This random string is encrypted using a hardcoded public RSA key. It sends the encrypted five-character string as a challenge to the supplied IP/port combo. The response from the IP is compared to the previously created random string. If they are not equal, the connection is closed. If the strings are equal, then a shell is created with the command prompt “>>” until it receives the exit command. This would allow them to run arbitrary commands on the impacted device. The reason for the RSA challenge in J-Magic is likely to prevent other attackers from spraying magic packets all over the Internet to enumerate infected networks and then use the backdoor for their own competing purposes. Black Lotus Labs said a backdoor used in 2014 by Russian-state threat group Turla also used such a challenge. Magic packets give backdoors more stealth because the malware doesn't need to open a specific port to listen for incoming connections. Defenders routinely scan their networks for such ports. If they spot an open port they don’t recognize, it’s likely the infection will be detected. Backdoors like J-Magic listen to all incoming data and search for tiny specks of it that meet certain conditions. The J-Magic agent is a variant of cd00r, a PoC first released in 2000 andupdatedin 2014. It was designed to, as the developer explained it, “test the idea of a completely invisible (read: not listening) backdoor server.” The same year cd00r was updated, security researchersfoundTurla implementing cd00r agent into its own custom backdoor. Magic packets have been in use for years. Threat actors working on behalf of theChinese governmentandother nation-stateshave beencaughtdoing the same thing, as have the developers of aproof-of-concept rootkitfor infecting GPUs. Black Lotus Labs also said that the campaign using J-Magic overlaps with one from 2023 that used a backdoor, tracked as SeaSpy, thatinfected Barracuda mail servers. Both borrow heavily from cd00r, and both are developed to run on FreeBSD, the operating system used in both Barracuda and Juniper devices. Black Lotus has determined that J-Magic was active from mid-2023 until at least mid-2024. Targets came from a wide array of industries, including semiconductor, energy, manufacturing, and IT verticals.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "New feature allows Claude to reference source documents and reduce hallucinations. On Thursday, Anthropic announcedCitations, a new API feature that helps Claude models avoid confabulations (also called hallucinations) by linking their responses directly to source documents. The feature lets developers add documents to Claude's context window, enabling the model to automatically cite specific passages it uses to generate answers. \"When Citations is enabled, the API processes user-provided source documents (PDF documents and plaintext files) by chunking them into sentences,\" Anthropic says. \"These chunked sentences, along with user-provided context, are then passed to the model with the user's query.\" The company describes several potential uses for Citations, including summarizing case files with source-linked key points, answering questions across financial documents with traced references, and powering support systems that cite specific product documentation. In its own internal testing, the company says that the feature improved recall accuracy by up to 15 percent compared to custom citation implementations created by users within prompts. While a 15 percent improvement in accurate recall doesn't sound like much, the new feature still attracted interest from AI researchers like Simon Willison because of its fundamental integration ofRetrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) techniques. In a detailed post on his blog, Willisonexplainedwhy citation features are important. \"The core of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern is to take a user's question, retrieve portions of documents that might be relevant to that question and then answer the question by including those text fragments in the context provided to the LLM,\" he writes. \"This usually works well, but there is still a risk that the model may answer based on other information from its training data (sometimes OK) or hallucinate entirely incorrect details (definitely bad).\" Willison notes that while citing sources helps verify accuracy, building a system that does it well \"can be quite tricky,\" but Citations appears to be a step in the right direction by building RAG capability directly into the model. Apparently, that capability is not a new thing. Anthropic's Alex Albertwroteon X, \"Under the hood, Claude is trained to cite sources. With Citations, we are exposing this ability to devs. To use Citations, users can pass a new \"citations: {enabled:true}\" parameter on any document type they send through the API.\" The company released Citations for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku models through both the Anthropic API and Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform, but it's apparently already getting some use in the field. Anthropic says that Thomson Reuters, which uses Claude to power itsCoCounsellegal AI reference platform, is looking forward to using Citations in a way that helps \"minimize hallucination risk but also strengthens trust in AI-generated content.\" Additionally, financial technology company Endex told Anthropic that Citations reduced their source confabulations from 10 percent to zero while increasing references per response by 20 percent, according to CEO Tarun Amasa. Despite these claims, relying on any LLM to accurately relay reference information isstill a riskuntil the technology is more deeply studied and proven in the field. Anthropic will charge users its standard token-based pricing, though quoted text in responses won't count toward output token costs. Sourcing a 100-page document as a reference would cost approximately $0.30 with Claude 3.5 Sonnet or $0.08 with Claude 3.5 Haiku, according to Anthropic's standard API pricing.

        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "\"I remember holding a baby dying of complications of pneumococcal meningitis.\" As federal lawmakers prepare to decide whether anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. should be the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, pediatricians from around the country are making emotional pleas to protect and support lifesaving immunizations. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has assembled nearly 200 storiesand dozens of testimonials on the horrors of vaccine-preventable deaths and illnesses that pediatricians have encountered over their careers. The testimonials have been shared with two Senate committees that will hold hearings later this week: the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP). Ina statement on Monday, AAP President Susan Kressly noted that the stories come from a wide range of pediatricians—from rural to urban and from small practices to large institutions. Some have recalled stories of patients who became ill with devastating diseases before vaccines were available to prevent them, while others shared more recent experiences as vaccine misinformation spread and vaccination rates slipped. In one, a pediatrician from Raleigh, North Carolina, spoke of a baby in the 1990s withStreptococcuspneumoniaemeningitis, a life-threatening disease. \"I remember holding a baby dying of complications of pneumococcal meningitis at that time. I remember that baby's face to this day—but, thanks to pneumococcal vaccination, have never had to relive that experience since,\" the doctor said. The first pneumococcal vaccine for infants waslicensed in the US in 2000. A doctor in Portland, Maine, meanwhile, faced the same disease in a patient who was unvaccinated despite the availability of the vaccine. \"As a resident, I cared for a young, unvaccinated child admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with life-threateningStreptococcus pneumoniaemeningitis. This devastating illness, once common, has become rare thanks to the widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. However, this child was left vulnerable...and [their parents] now faced the anguish of watching their child fight for their life on a ventilator.\" Kressly emphasizes that \"One unifying theme of these stories: vaccines allow children to grow up healthy and thrive. As senators consider nominees for federal healthcare agencies, we hope these testimonies will help paint a picture of just how important vaccinations are to children’s long-term health and wellbeing.\" Though AAP—like all other major medical and health organizations—considers the safety and efficacy of vaccines \"settled science,\" fear has grown for the future of vaccination in the US after President Trump selected Kennedy as his pick for health secretary. Kennedy is a well-established anti-vaccine advocate who ran the anti-vaccine organization Children's Health Defense (aka CHD, and formerly the World Mercury Project, WMP) between 2015 and 2023. In that time, he served as board chair and chief legal counsel. Kennedy haslong spread false, debunked claimsthat vaccines are linked to autism (there is no link), and that mercury in vaccines cause harm (themercury-based preservative Thimerosalhas not been linked to any harms beyond minor redness and swelling, and it hasn't been used in childhood vaccines since 2001). He has also falsely claimed that childhood vaccines have not been tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (they have) or been tested in \"a safety study pre-licensing\" (they have). In 2018 and 2019, Kennedy and CHD spread misinformation andstoked fear of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine in Samoa. Vaccination coverage plummeted to just 31 percent. In November of that year, an outbreak of measles took hold, ultimately killing 83 people, mostly children. Among the health workers who responded to the outbreak was Josh Green, a physician and now Hawaii governor. Green helped with a mass vaccination campaign at the time.He wrote of the experiencein The New York Times earlier this month, noting Kennedy's role in the outbreak and sharing an experience visiting the home of a toddler who had just died of measles: \"The child was lying on a makeshift bed in the middle of the family’s one-room house, her face still red from fever. I put my hands on her face and could feel the warmth in her skin, but her eyes were fixed and glazed over. My stethoscope confirmed she was no longer breathing. In spite of her severe case of measles, her family was caring for her at home because the hospital was filled beyond capacity and there weren’t enough doctors, nurses or beds to accommodate her. We shared a moment of mourning for her with her parents and then proceeded to vaccinate her family members at the parents’ request before we had to move on to continue our mission.\" Meanwhile in 2019, Kennedy led a (failed) legal effort to try toweaken vaccination requirements in New York schools, and a study led by researchers at the University of Maryland identified Kennedy's CHD/WMP asthe single leading source of anti-vaccine ads on Facebook. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy and CHD gained yet more prominence. Since 2000, CHD filed nearly 30 federal and state lawsuitschallenging vaccine and public health policies. In 2021,Kennedy petitioned the FDA to rescind the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines. In 2022,CHD was permanently banned from Facebook and Instagram, which occurred just days after the organization seemed tocelebrate dips in vaccination rates amid the spread of polio in New York. The stories and testimonies of the pediatrician highlight how dangerous Kennedy's actions are. \"I … have had the devastating experience of witnessing an infant turn blue repeatedly from repeated coughing bouts then die from the pertussis that wreaked her infant lungs,\" a Colorado pediatrician wrote. \"I have intubated babies with RSV whose secretions were drowning them. I held a mother’s hand while she sobbed as her toddler lay postictal [with altered consciousness] from his umpteenth seizure from his varicella encephalitis.\" There are vaccines available that prevent pertussis (whopping cough), RSV, and varicella (chickenpox). An Ohio pediatrician share memories of a two-month stint at a hospital in Ghana in 1980. \"I still see the faces of the children with complications of measles, polio, or tetanus: muscle spasms, difficulty breathing, pneumonia, and dehydration,\" she said. \"I returned to Ohio reflecting on how fortunate we were to have access to effective vaccines against those illnesses.\" Another pediatrician told a story of a family who refused vaccinations until the unvaccinated child of a family friend died ofStreptococcal pneumoniasepsis while on a trip abroad. \"Immediately upon return to the United States, my patient’s mother called and asked how quickly we can get her children fully vaccinated,\" the doctor wrote. \"She stated she realized that the risk of death was real and that the risk of adverse developmental outcomes had not been scientifically proven and was a minor concern compared to losing her child.\" TheSenate Committee on Financewill consider Kennedy's nomination on January 29, while theHELP committeewill hold its hearing on January 30.

Well, for one thing, your cholesterol levels could reach such stratospheric levels that lipids start oozing from your blood vessels, forming yellowish nodules on your skin. That was the disturbing case of a man in Florida who showed up at a Tampa hospital with a three-week history of painless, yellow eruptions on the palms of his hands, soles of his feet, and elbows.His case was published today in JAMA Cardiology. The man, said to be in his 40s, told doctors that he had adopted a \"carnivore diet\" eight months prior. His diet included between 6 lbs and 9 lbs of cheese, sticks of butter, and daily hamburgers that had additional fat incorporated into them. Since taking on this brow-raising food plan, he claimed his weight dropped, his energy levels increased, and his \"mental clarity\" improved. Meanwhile, his total cholesterol level exceeded 1,000 mg/dL. For context, an optimal total cholesterol level isunder 200 mg/dL, while 240 mg/dL is considered the threshold for 'high.' Cardiologists noted that prior to going on his fatty diet, his cholesterol had been between 210 mg/dL to 300 mg/dL. The cardiologists diagnosed the man with xanthelasma, a condition in which excess blood lipids ooze from blood vessels and form localized lipid deposits. The escaped lipids would normally be taken up by roaming white blood cells called macrophages. But, in cases with xanthelasma, the amount of lipids is too large for the macrophages, which turn into foam cells with the excess cholesterol, leading to visible deposits. Such deposits are often seen around the eye (a condition called xanthelasma palpebrarum), which often strikes people with lipid abnormalities, such as familial hypercholesterolemia. It's thought that continuous blinking of the eye over a person's life can eventually weaken capillaries in the area, allowing for lipid seepage. But, while this may be a more common presentation of the condition, lipid deposits can occur anywhere in the body. Xanthelasma—especially xanthelasma palpebrarum—isnot always associated with high cholesteroland heart risks, but having high total cholesterol isstrongly associated with coronary heart disease. The case study doesn't provide information on the man's outlook. However, the authors write that the case \"highlights the impact of dietary patterns on lipid levels and the importance of managing hypercholesterolemia to prevent complications.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "content": "FBI claims GameOn founder forged six years of financial records in brazen scheme. The founder of an AI startup in San Francisco was indicted this week for allegedly conspiring with his wife for six years to defraud investors out of $60 million. According to apress releasefrom the US Attorney's Office in the Northern District of California, Alexander Beckman—founder of GameOn Technology (now known as ON Platform)—and Valerie Lau Beckman—an attorney hired by GameOn who later became his wife—were charged with 25 counts, including conspiracy, wire fraud, securities fraud, identity theft, and other offenses. Lau also faces one charge of obstruction of justice after allegedly deleting evidence. If convicted, the maximum penalties for Beckman, 41, could exceed 60 years and for Lau, 38, potentially 80 years. GameOn was founded in 2014 and later became known for developing a popular customer service chatbot functionality that today is used by major sports leagues like the NFL and high-end luxury brands like Valentino and Armani Exchange. In theindictment, it's alleged that Beckman's business plan for GameOn was unsustainable. The AI startup initially offered its chatbot as a \"free pilot without any contract\" and seemingly only rarely benefited from revenue-sharing agreements. GameOn even sometimes would pay large annual fees to customers without receiving anything in return, including in one year paying \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" to a sports league while receiving \"no payments and no revenue sharing,\" an FBI investigation found. To keep the business afloat, Beckman depended entirely on investors, the indictment alleged. Seeking millions to cover both business and personal expenses, Beckman allegedly dreamed up a \"brazen and wide-ranging\" scheme to defraud investors starting in 2018, the indictment said. To further the alleged scheme, he \"often described non-existent revenue, inflated cash balances,\" and \"otherwise exaggerated customer relationships,\" the US Attorney's Office said, to convince investors to spend millions. As Beckman's accomplice, Lau allegedly manipulated documents, including documents allegedly stolen from the venture capital firm that employed her while supposedly hiding her work for GameOn. The scheme apparently also included forging audits and bank statements, as well as using \"the names of at least seven real people—including fake emails and signatures—without their permission to distribute false and fraudulent GameOn financial and business information and documents with the intent to defraud GameOn and its investors,\" the US Attorney's Office said. At perhaps the furthest extreme, Lau allegedly falsified account statements, including once faking a balance of over $13 million when that account only had $25 in it. The FBI found that GameOn's revenues never exceeded $1 million in any year, while Beckman allegedly inflated sales to investors, including claiming that sales in one quarter in 2023 got as high as $72 million. Beckman and Lau allegedly went to great lengths to hide the scheme while diverting investor funds to their personal accounts. While GameOn employees allegedly sometimes went without paychecks, Beckman and Lau allegedly stole funds to buy expensive San Francisco real estate and pay for their wedding in 2023. If convicted, they may be forced to forfeit a $4.2 million house, a Tesla Model X, and other real estate and property purchased with their allegedly ill-gotten gains, the indictment said. It took about five years for the cracks to begin to show in Beckman's scheme. Beginning in 2023, Beckman increasingly started facing \"questions about specific customers and specific revenue from those customers,\" the indictment said. By February 2024, Beckman at last \"acknowledged to at least one GameOn consultant\" that a flagged audit report \"did not contain accurate financial information,\" but allegedly, he \"attempted to shift blame to others for the inaccuracies.\" His alleged deflections, however, perhaps got him caught after he supposedly started creating fake email addresses of real financial institution employees to continue to raise money while questions were still swirling. Around June 2024, an investor partner serving on GameOn's board of directors asked to visit a bank branch to see a statement. Allegedly, Lau planted a fake statement at the bank to continue to cover up the scheme, a visit that the FBI showed in the indictment was caught on security cameras. Soon after, Beckman resigned from GameOn in July 2024, the indictment suggested. ON Platform did not respond to Ars' request to comment, even though GameOn employees and customers were also allegedly harmed by the scheme. \"Beckman and Lau knew that GameOn depended on new investor funds to operate, burned through its funds, received overdraft notices from banks, was delinquent in paying certain customers, and often was on the brink of not having enough money in the bank to operate and make payroll,\" the indictment said. And they \"knew that GameOn was late to pay payroll on multiple occasions and used individual bank accounts and credit cards to pay their employees.\" Further, Beckman \"misled GameOn investors by describing certain customer relationships as producing revenue for GameOn when in fact Beckman knew that GameOn owed those customers money and was regularly late in paying them.\" Ars reached out to several ON Platform customers listed on the company's site, including the NFL, the United Soccer League, Valentino, Armani Exchange, and Live Nation, to find out how some of the biggest brands are responding to the indictment.

        "content": "80 percent of game devs are working on a PC project, up from 66 percent last year. Four out of five game developers are currently working on a project for the PC, a sizable increase from 66 percent of developers a year ago. That's according toInforma's latest State of the Game Industry survey, which partnered with Omdia to ask over 3,000 game industry professionals about their work in advance of March's Game Developers Conference. The 80 percent of developers working on PC projects in this year's survey is by far the highest mark for any platform dating back to at least 2018, when 60 percent of surveyed developers were working on a PC game. In the years since, the ratio of game developers working on the PC has hovered between 56 and 66 percent before this year's unexpected jump. The number of game developers saying they wereinterestedin the PC as a platform also increased substantially, from 62 percent last year to 74 percent this year. The PC has long been the most popular platform for developers to work on in the annual State of the Game Industry survey, easily outpacing consoles and mobile platforms that generally see active work from anywhere between 12 to 36 percent of developer respondents, depending on the year. In its report, Informa notes this surge as a \"passion for PC development explod[ing]\" among developers, and mentions that while \"PC has consistently been the platform of choice... this year saw its dominance increase even more.\" The increasing popularity of PC gaming among developers is also reflected in the number of individual game releases on Steam, which topped out at a record of 18,974 individual titles for 2024,according to SteamDB. That record number was up over 32 percent from 2023, which was up from just under 16 percent from 2022 (though many Steam games each year were \"Limited Games\" that failed to meetValve's minimum engagement metricsfor Badges and Trading Cards). While it's hard to pinpoint a single reason for the sudden surge in the popularity of PC game development, Informa speculates that it's \"connected to the rising popularity of Valve’s Steam Deck.\" While Valve has onlyofficially acknowledged \"multiple millions\" in sales for the portable hardware, GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carlessestimatedthat between 3 million and 4 million Steam Deck units had been sold by October 2023, up significantly fromreports of 1 million Deck shipmentsin October 2022. That's a sizable start for the nascent handheld PC gaming market, but it's still a relative drop in the bucket compared tothe nearly 2 billion worldwide PC gamers(of some stripe) estimated by DFC Intelligence or eventhe 39 millionconcurrentplayers Steam registered in December(not to mentionover 100 million Switch consoles). An influx of a few million units of the Steam Deck (and its imitators) would seem unlikely to make such a sudden impact on the world of PC game development. Then again, the Steam Deck marks the first real opportunity for most gamers to play PC games away froma bulky desktop towerorslightly less bulky gaming laptop. The prospect of playing games on the couch, in bed, or even on a plane could be attracting more developers to a PC platform that canalsohandle advanced graphical effects on higher-end hardware (sorry, Nintendo Switch). Of course, there's a chance this year's PC gaming jump is just statistical noise. Informa's survey is a self-selected sample from amongthe tens of thousands of attendees going to the Game Developers Conference, which is in itself a (relatively well-off) subset of the hundreds of thousands of professional and hobbyist game developers worldwide. While the self-reported platform numbers among that sample have not been very noisy in years past, all the major platforms (except for the Xbox Series X/S) saw at least a slight uptick between the 2024 and 2025 surveys, suggesting what might be an odd annual sample of developers. In any case, this year's survey serves asyet anotherdatapointsuggesting PC gaming is alargeandstill growingsection of the industry, even assmartphonesandconsoles like the Switchcontinue to attract widespread interest from gamers.

        "title": "US‘s wind and solar will generate more power than coal in 2024",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "Utility-scale solar generation is up by over 30% amid future uncertainties. The Energy Information Agency has nowreleased dataon the performance of the US's electric grid over the first 11 months of 2024 and will be adding the final month soon (and a month is very little time for anything to change significantly in the data). The biggest story in the data is the dramatic growth of solar energy, with a 30 percent increase in generation in a single year, which will allow solar and wind combined to overtake coal in 2024. But the US energy demand saw an increase of nearly 3 percent, which is roughly double the amount of additional solar generation. Should electric use continue to grow at a similar pace, renewable production will have to continue to grow dramatically for a few years before it can simply cover the added demand. In the first 11 months of 2024, the US saw its electrical use grow by 2.8 percent, or roughly 100 Terawatt-hours. While there's typically year-to-year variation in use due to weather-driven demand, the US's consumption has largely been flat since the early 2000s. There are plenty of reasons to expect increased demand, including the growth of data centers and the electrification of heating and transit, but so far, there's been no clear sign of it in the data. As a result, the rapid growth of renewables has largely displaced fossil fuel generation—specifically coal—rather than meeting increased demand. Despite the rise in demand, however, the long-term decline in coal has continued in 2024, with generation via coal down by nearly 5 percent. This will mean that this is the first year that wind and solar will combine to outproduce coal. Collectively, they'll account for roughly 17 percent of the US's energy production, while coal will only provide about 15 percent. The boost in wind and solar production has also been larger than the increase in generation from natural gas, which remains the single largest source of power on the grid, generating nearly 44 percent of the electricity used in the US. While wind currently accounts for 60 percent of the \"wind plus solar\" figure, it's unlikely to stay on top for long. Generation from wind power grew by 7.6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. By contrast, utility-scale solar generation increased by 31 percent over that same period, with small-scale solar (including rooftop installations) estimated to have increased by 15 percent. Adding in hydropower and a handful of minor sources like geothermal brings the total renewable electricity generated in the first 11 months of 2024 up to 23 percent of the total demand. Adding in nuclear to get the total of emissions-free generation brings the total up to 41 percent—just shy of the 44 percent produced by natural gas. Another way to look at things is that, between the decline of coal use and added demand, the grid had to generate an additional 136 TW-hr in the first 11 months of 2024. Sixty-three of those were handled by an increase in generation using natural gas; the rest, or slightly more than half, came from emissions-free sources. So, renewable power is now playing a key role in offsetting demand growth. While that's a positive, it also means that renewables are displacing less fossil fuel use than they might. In addition, some of the growth of small-scale solar won't show up on the grid, since it offset demand locally, and so also reduced some of the demand for fossil fuels. Confusing matters, this number can also include things like community solar, whichdoesend up on the grid; the EIA doesn't break out these numbers. We can expect next year's numbers to also show a large growth in solar production, as the EIA says that the US saw record levels of new solar installations in 2024, with 37 gigawatts of new capacity. Since some of that came online later in the year, it'll produce considerably more power next year. And, in its latest short-term energy analysis, the EIA expects to see over 20 GW of solar capacity added in each of the next two years. New wind capacity will push that above 30 GW of renewable capacity each of these years. That growth will, it's expected, more than offset continued growth in demand, although that growth is expected to be somewhat slower than we saw in 2024. It also predicts about 15 GW of coal will be removed from the grid during those two years. So, even without any changes in policy, we're likely to see a very dynamic grid landscape over the next few years. But changes in policy are almost certainly on the way. Theflurry of executive ordersissued by the Trump administration includes a number of energy-related changes. These include defining \"energy\" in a way that excludes wind and solar, an end to offshore wind leasing and the threat to terminate existing leases, and a re-evaluation of the allocation of funds from some of the Biden administration's energy-focused laws. In essence, this sets up a clash among economics, state policies, and federal policy. Even without any subsidies, wind and solar are the cheapest ways to produce electricity in much of the US. In addition, a number of states have mandates that will require the use of more renewable energy. At the same time, the permitting process for the plants and their grid connections will often require approvals at the federal level, and it appears to be official policy to inhibit renewables when possible. And a number of states are also making attempts to block new renewable power installations. It's going to be a challenging period for everyone involved in renewable energy.

        "content": "The prequel series is set a couple of years before the events of the original 1979 film,Alien. FX/Hulu dropped a surprise short teaser for its upcoming spinoff series,Alien: Earth, during the AFC Championship game last night. What makes it intriguing is the way it's shot entirely from a Xenomorph's point of view as the creature races through a spaceship's corridor while a \"containment breached!\" warning repeats. The final shot said the spaceship is headed on a crash course toward Earth. The official premise is short and sweet: \"When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat.\" We know very little yet about the specifics of the series other than that it is set two years before the events of the first film,Alien(1979). It's promising that showrunner Noah Hawleyhas saidthat the style and mythology will be closer to that film, rather thanPrometheus(2012) orAlien: Covenant, both of which were also prequels. “In the prequels, Ridley [Scott] made the technology thousands of years more advanced than the technology ofAlien, which is supposed to take place in those movies’ future,\"he said last January. \"There’s something about that that doesn’t really compute for me. I prefer the retro-futurism of the first two films, and so that’s the choice I’ve made—there’s no holograms. The convenience of that beautiful Apple Store technology is not available to me.” Chandler's character is named Wendy, and apparently she has \"the body of an adult and the consciousness of a child.\" The eminently watchable Timothy Olyphant plays her synth mentor and trainer, Kirsh, and here's hoping he brings some space cowboy vibes to the role. The cast also includes Alex Lawther as the soldier named CJ; Samuel Blenkin as a CEO named Boy Kavalier; Essie Davis as Dame Silvia; Adarsh Gourav as Slightly; Kit Young as Tootles; and Sandra Yi Sencindiver as a senior member of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. I think we can expect at least some cast members to end up as xenomorph fodder. Alien: Romuluswas a welcome return to the franchise's horror roots, andAlien: Earthwill bring the horror to our home planet. “There’s something about seeing a Xenomorph in the wilds of Earth with your own eyes,” Hawleytold Deadline Hollywoodin September. “I can’t tell you under what circumstances you’ll see that, but you’ll see it — and you’re going to lock your door that night.” As for creature design, \"What was really fun for me was to really engage with the creature, bring some of my own thoughts to the design while not touching the silhouette, because that’s sacrosanct,\" he said. \"But some of the elements as we know, whatever the host is informs what the final creature is. I just wanted to play around a little bit to make it as scary as it should be.” Alien: Earthpremieres on FX/Hulu this summer.

        "title": "A long, costly road ahead for customers abandoning Broadcom’s VMware",
        "source": "https://arstechnica.com/",
        "content": "\"We loved VMware, and then when Broadcom bought ‘em, we hated ‘em.” Broadcom's ownership of VMware hasdiscouraged many of its customers, as companies are displeased with how thetrillion-dollar firmhas run the virtualization business since buying it in November 2023. Many have discussed reducing oreliminating ties with the company. Now, over a year after the acquisition, the pressure is on for customers to start committing to a VMware subscription, forego VMware support, or move on from VMware technologies. The decision is complex, with long-term implications no matter which way a customer goes. Ars Technica spoke with an IT vendor manager who has been using VMware's vSphere since the early 2000s. The employee, who works for a global food manufacturing firm with about 5,500 employees, asked to keep their name and company anonymous due to privacy concerns for the business. \"We love it. ... It's hard for us to figure out how we can live without it, but we're going to,\" the IT manager said. The food manufacturer has about 300 VMware virtual machines (VMs), and every company application runs on top of VMware. Its five-year enterprise agreement with VMware expired in December, making the manufacturer ineligible for VMware support unless it buys a VMware subscription. The company started exploring virtualization alternatives this summer because costs associated with running vSphere are set to rise fourfold, according to the IT manager. As with other VMware customers, the price increases are largely due to Broadcom bundling unwanted VMware products together. \"They wouldn't sell us what we need,\" the IT manager said. While it looks for a new platform, the manufacturer is relying on support from Spinnaker, which started offering software maintenance support for VMware following Broadcom’s acquisition. In an example of how widespread VMware support concerns are, Spinnaker’s VMware support business has had more leads than any of Spinnaker's other support businesses, including for Oracle or SAP, said Martin Biggs, Spinnaker’s VP and managing director of strategic initiatives and EMEA. Organizations contacting Spinnaker are reporting price increases of “3–6x” on average, Biggs told Ars. The largest price rise Spinnaker has heard about is a reported twentyfold increase in costs, he said. Biggs said that Broadcom has started to discount some subscriptions, with price increases going from seven- or eightfold to three- or fourfold, or \"sometimes a little bit less.” This could pressure customers to commit to VMware while terms are more favorable than they might be in the future. Speaking toThe Registerthis month, Gartner VP analyst Michael Warrilow said he feared Broadcom would raise VMware prices higher in the future. Heightening the potential consequences associated with staying with or leaving VMware, Warrilow emphasized that Broadcom prefers two- or three-year subscriptions, meaning customers may find themselves facing a more pricey VMware sooner than later. “Everybody's asking what everybody else is doing, and everybody else is asking what everybody else is doing, so nobody's really doing anything,” he said. The Registeralso recently reported that customers are being pressured into three-year long VMware subscriptions, citing an unnamed VMware customer that it spoke with and a discussion onReddit. When reached for comment, Broadcom only referred The Register to a Juneblog postby Broadcom CEO Hock Tan about evolving VMware strategy. Support is a critical factor for numerous customers considering migrating from VMware, especially becauseVMware perpetual licensesare no longer beingsold or supportedby Broadcom. But there's also concern about support offered to clients with subscriptions. For the food manufacturer currently researching VMware rivals, a perceived lack of support under Broadcom was also a deterrent. The company's IT manager said that after Broadcom bought VMware, the manufacturer was no longer able to contact VMware directly for support and was told in July that it should direct problems to IT distributor Ingram Micro moving forward. The manager said this information was relayed to the customer after a support ticket it filed was automatically moved to Ingram, with Broadcom telling the firm it wasn’t big enough to receive direct support. Ingram's response times were a week or longer, and in December, Ingram announced asevere reductionof its VMware business (VMware still works with other distributors, like Arrow). Support concerns from VMware resellers started before Ingram’s announcement, though. An anonymous reseller, for example,told CRNthat it had to wait a month on average for VMware quotes through a distributor, compared to “two to three days” pre-Broadcom.The Register, citing VMware customers, also reported that Ingram was having difficulties handling “the increased responsibilities it assumed,\" citing VMware customers. In a January Gartner research note entitled \"Estimating a Large-Scale VMware,\" Gartner analysts detailed the burdens expected for large-sized companies moving off of VMware. The note defined a large-scale migration as a “concerted program of work covering the migration of a significant portion of virtualized workloads” that “would likely represent 2,000 or more\" VMs, \"and/or at least 100 hosts.” That's a much larger migration than the food manufacturer's 300 VMs, but Gartner's analysis helps illustrate the magnitude of work associated with migrating. Gartner's note estimated that large-scale migrations, including scoping and technical evaluation, would take 18 to 48 months. The analysts noted that they “expect a midsize enterprise would take at least two years to untangle much of its dependency upon VMware’s server virtualization platform.” The analysts also estimated migration to cost $300 to $3,000 per VM if the user employed a third-party service provider. Critically, the report adds: It is highly likely that other costs would be incurred in a large-scale migration. This includes acquisition of new software licenses and/or cloud expenses, hardware purchases (compute, storage), early termination costs related to the existing virtual environment, application testing/quality assurance, and test equipment. The heavy costs—in terms of finances, time, and staff—force customers to face questions and hesitations around leaving VMware, despite many customers facing disruption from Broadcom-issued changes to the platform. When asked if there’s anything Broadcom could do to win back the food manufacturer’s 300 VMs, its IT manager told Ars that if Broadcom offered a subscription to vSphere alone, the manufacturer would reconsider, even if subscription costs were twice as expensive as before. For the global food manufacturer, the biggest challenge in ditching VMware is internal, not technical. \"We just don't have enough internal resources and timing,\" the manager said. \"That's what I'm worried about. This is going to take a lot of time internally to go through this whole process, and we're shorthanded as it is. It's such a big, heavy lift for us, and we're also very risk averse, so swapping out that piece of technology in our infrastructure is risky.\" VMware users are now at a crossroads as they're forced to make crucial decisions for their IT infrastructure. Ditching or sticking with VMware both have long-lasting implications; migrations are onerous and pricey, but life under Broadcom will be expensive, with potential future bumps and twists. Broadcom has previously responded to Ars' and others' requests for comment aroundcustomer complaintswith blog posts from Broadcom's Tan that emphasize commitment to VMware's strategic changes. But some will brave costly challenges to avoid those moves. Summarizing their take on Broadcom's changes, the food manufacturer's IT executive said, \"We loved VMware. And then when Broadcom bought 'em, we hated 'em.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "content": "The US is currently the WHO's biggest funder, contributing about 18% of its budget. The World Health Organization has begun cost-cutting measures in preparation for a US withdrawal next year,according to reporting by Reuters. On his first day in office, President Trumpsigned an executive order to withdraw the USfrom the United Nation's health agency. The country was a founding member of the WHO in 1948 and has since been a key member of the organization, which has 193 other member states. The executive order cited Trump's long-standing complaints about the agency's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, dues payments, and alleged protection of China as the reasons for the withdrawal. Ina statement on Tuesday, the WHO said it \"regrets\" the announcement and hopes the US will reconsider. \"WHO plays a crucial role in protecting the health and security of the world’s people, including Americans, by addressing the root causes of disease, building stronger health systems, and detecting, preventing and responding to health emergencies, including disease outbreaks, often in dangerous places where others cannot go,\" the statement reads. \"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats. Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication. American institutions have contributed to and benefited from membership in WHO.\" Under a 1948 Joint Resolution of Congress, a US withdrawal from the WHO requires a one-year notice period. A spokesperson for the United Nations confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that it received a notice from the US of its intent to withdraw dated January 22, makingthe formal withdrawal date January 22, 2026. On January 23, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus sent a memo to staff announcing the cost-cutting measures. Reuters obtained a copy of the memo. \"This announcement has made our financial situation more acute,\" Tedros wrote, referring to the US withdrawal plans. WHO's budget mainly comes fromdues and voluntary contributionsfrom member states. The dues are a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, and the percentage is set by the UN General Assembly. US contributions account for about 18 percent of WHO's overall funding, and its two-year 2024-2025 budget was $6.8 billion, according to Reuters. To prepare for the budget cut, WHO is halting recruitment, significantly curtailing travel expenditures, making all meetings virtual, limiting IT equipment updates, and suspending office refurbishment. \"This set of measures is not comprehensive, and more will be announced in due course,\" Tedros wrote, adding that the agency would do everything it could to protect and support staff. The country's pending withdrawal has been heavily criticized by global health leaders and US experts, who say it will make the world less safe and weaken America.In a CBS/KFF Health News report examining the global health implicationsof the US withdrawal, Kenneth Bernard, a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who served as a top biodefense official during the George W. Bush administration, did not mince words: \"It's just stupid,\" Bernard said. \"Withdrawing from the WHO leaves a gap in global health leadership that will be filled by China,\" he said, \"which is clearly not in America's best interests.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

        "content": "Experts say Trump administration’s order to halt foreign assistance will ‘cost many, many lives’. The head of the United Nations has expressed concern about President Donald Trump’s decision to pause foreign assistance from the United States as his administration promotes its “America First” agenda. During a news conference on Monday, a spokesman for Antonio Guterres said the UN secretary-general had noted the policy change “with concern”. “He calls for additional exemptions to be considered to ensure the continued delivery of critical development and humanitarian activities for the most vulnerable communities around the world,” Stephane Dujarric told reporters. “Those lives and livelihoods depend on this support,” said Dujarric, adding that the US is “one of the largest aid providers” in the world. “We are currently mapping out what [the Trump administration’s decision] means and the impact that it would have.” Trump signedan executive ordershortly after he was sworn in for a second term on January 20, ordering all federal government agencies to enact a 90-day pause on foreign development assistance and to review existing programmes.    “It is the policy of United States that no further United States foreign assistance shall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States,” the order reads. Days later, the US State Departmentsaid in a memo that it was suspendingalmost all new funding for foreign aid programmes with exceptions for the country’s top Middle East allies, Israel and Egypt. The order on Friday also included an exemption for emergency food assistance and related expenses. “President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people,” the department said ina statementon Sunday defending the measures. The statement also affirmed newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s support for the Trump-led policy. “Reviewing and realigning foreign assistance on behalf of hardworking taxpayers is not just the right thing to do, it is a moral imperative. The Secretary is proud to protect America’s investment with a deliberate and judicious review of how we spend foreign assistance dollars overseas.” But experts have slammed the Trump administration’s decision, saying it will have disastrous consequences for people around the world. A global stop-work order on foreign aid will cost many, many lives if kept in place.As written, it halts ALL ongoing humanitarian relief activities, except food aid, in places like Syria, Sudan, Gaza.Also halts all global health programs.What this will mean in human terms:🧵t.co/1nCjZFfBdS —Jeremy Konyndyk (@jeremykonyndyk.bsky.social)2025-01-25T03:33:26.842Z  Michael Schiffer, who served as the assistant administrator of the US Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Asia bureau from 2022 to 2025, said stopping foreign aid — even temporarily — will have “obvious, predictable results”. “Children will die. Our national security will erode. America’s alliances will suffer. US partners will be at risk. And America’s enemies will rejoice,” Schiffer warned ina columnfor the website Just Security. Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and an ex-USAID official under former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, also said “a global stop-work order on foreign aid will cost many, many lives if kept in place”. Konyndyk noted that US foreign assistance goes to addressing famine in Sudan, supporting refugees in Africa and Asia, and funding HIV/AIDS treatment programmes around the world. “It is no exaggeration whatsoever to say that following through on this policy will kill a lot of people,” he wrote on social media. “It will also shred US global credibility in much of the world, where our assistance programs are a huge share of our country partnerships.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "content": "The Electronic Intifada’s executive director says his offence was ‘being a journalist who speaks up for Palestine’. Washington, DC –Palestinian American journalistAli Abunimahhas confirmed that Swiss authorities have released and deported him after holding him for three days. Abunimah, the executive director of the Electronic Intifada publication, suggested in a social media post on Monday that Switzerland detained him because of his advocacy for Palestinian rights. “My ‘crime’? Being a journalist who speaks up for Palestine and against Israel’s genocide and settler-colonial savagery and those who aid and abet it,” he wrote. Abunimah was arrested in Zurich on Saturday before he was set to deliver a speech in the city, sparking outrage from Palestinian rights advocates. The Swiss embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. The Reuters news agency reported on Sunday that the Swiss police cited an entry ban and other measures under the country’s immigration law as the reason for Abunimah’s arrest.    The Palestinian American journalist said that when he was questioned by police officers, they accused him of “offending against Swiss law” without providing specific charges. He said he was “cut off from communication with the outside world, in a cell 24 hours a day”, adding that he was unable to contact his family. He added that he was only given back his phone at the gate of the plane that flew him to Istanbul. Abunimah noted that during the period when he was taken to prison like a “dangerous criminal”, Switzerland welcomed Israeli President Isaac Herzog to the World Economic Forumin Davos. Herzog has sparked controversy for his stance on Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians. He previously said that there are no “uninvolved civilians” in Gaza. “This ordeal lasted three days but that taste of prison was more than enough to leave me in even greater awe of the Palestinian heroes who endure months and years in the prisons of the genocidal oppressor,” Abunimah said. “More than ever, I know that the debt we owe them is one we can never repay and all of them must be free and they must remain our focus.” I’m free! I wrote this on the plane and I’m posting it just after landing at Istanbul. On Monday evening I was brought to Zurich airport in handcuffs, in a small metal cage inside a windowless prison van and led all the way to the plane by police. This is after three days and two…pic.twitter.com/S4BF2eEYYQ — Ali Abunimah (@AliAbunimah)January 27, 2025  United Nations experts had decried Abunimah’s detention as an assault on free speech. Irene Khan, a UN special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression, described Abunimah’s arrest as “shocking news” on Saturday and urged his release. Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, also called for an investigation into the incident. “The climate surroundingfreedom of speechin Europe is becoming increasingly toxic, and we should all be concerned,” Albanese wrote in a social media post. Abunimah’s detention came amid an increased clampdown on pro-Palestine voices in Europe amid thewar on Gaza, which UN experts have compared with genocide. In April, Germany shut down a conference for Palestinian rights advocates and denied entry to the British doctorGhassan Abu Sittah, who had worked in Gaza. Activists have also accused German authorities of cracking downon proteststhroughout the war. In October 2024, British counterterrorism police raided the home of Abunimah’s Electronic Intifada colleague Asa Winstanley — an incident that the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said was part of a “disturbing pattern of weaponizing counter-terrorism laws against reporters”.    Months earlier, British authorities held journalist Richard Medhurst, who is vocally critical of Israeli policies, for 24 hours as he arrived in London. Medhurst said on Saturday that the “terrorism” investigation against him was extended until May. In Gaza,Israel has killed205 journalists since the start of the war in October 2023, according to local authorities.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "The move breaks with federal norms against punishing civil servants for actions taken under a different administration. The administration of United States President Donald Trump has fired more than a dozen prosecutors linked to the investigation and prosecution of the Republican leader while he was out of office. Monday’s terminations were effective immediately and applied to employees in the Department of Justice, according to anonymous sources within Trump’s government. An official told the Reuters news agency that acting Attorney General James McHenry, a Trump appointee, had determined that the prosecutors “could not be trusted to faithfully implement the President’s agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the President”. The move underscored Trump’s threats to seek retribution against those who scrutinised his behaviour — and it marked a break with longstanding norms that career government employees should not be punished for carrying out tasks under a preceding administration. Trump took office on January 20for a second termas president, after serving previously from 2017 to 2021.    Those affected by Monday’s firings included prosecutors who had worked with former Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led two probes into Trump before stepping down. One focused on Trump’s retention of hundreds ofclassified documentsat his private residence, despite a subpoena in 2022 for their return. The other zeroed in on his behaviour before, during and after the 2020 presidential election, whichhe lostto Democrat Joe Biden. Trump was accused of seeking tosubvert the election results, which he falsely claimed were marred by widespread voter fraud. Both investigations resulted in federal criminal indictments: the first inFloridaand the second inWashington, DC. Trump was the first US president, past or present, to face criminal charges. In addition to the federal cases, he was also charged in two state-level indictments. One, inGeorgia, also pertained to Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The other, inNew York, accused Trump of falsifying business documents to conceal a hush-money payment to an adult film actress during his successful 2016 presidential campaign. In that case, Trump wasfound guiltyon 34 felony counts, though he was sentenced to an “unconditional discharge” — wherein he was released with no penalties. Trump has denied wrongdoing in all four cases and accused the prosecutors of leading a politically motivated “witch hunt”. While the state-level cases were prosecuted by local district attorneys, the federal cases were overseen by the Biden administration’s Department of Justice. But to maintain the independence of the investigations,then-Attorney General Merrick Garlandnamed a special counsel who was not a political appointee to lead the probes:Jack Smith, who had previously prosecuted war crimes at The Hague. Neither of Smith’s cases against Trump made it to trial. After Trump was re-elected in November 2024, Smithdroppedboth cases, citing longstanding Justice Department policy not to prosecute sitting presidents. He alsostepped downas special counsel. Smith did, however,release a reportabout one of the two indictments, underscoring the strength of the prosecution’s case. “But for Mr. Trump’s election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,” the report said. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has led a purge of federal government offices. On January 24, for instance, news reports revealed he had fired a dozen inspectors general: officials charged with serving as watchdogs over key government agencies. Some experts say their terminations violated federal law requiring advance notice of 30 days for the removal of an inspector general — and a clear rationale for the firing. On the day of his inauguration, Trump teased the widespread dismissal of “Biden bureaucrats”at a rallywith his supporters at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC. “Most of those bureaucrats are being fired. They’re gone. Should be all of them, but some sneak through,” he said. In a statement on Monday to The Associated Press, an anonymous Trump official echoed the president’s talking points in discussing the prosecutors’ dismissals: “This action is consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "David Bowie’s 1987 concert in West Berlin could be heard on the other side of the Wall in Eastern Germany, triggering a police crackdown on listeners. Berlin, Germany –When David Bowie’s Glass Spider Tour arrived in West Berlin on June 6, 1987, the city was the world’s de facto capital of geopolitical turmoil, cleft in two physically and politically by 168km (104 miles) of machine-gun-guarded concrete wall. The stage on which Bowie was to perform lay to the west of the division line on the derelict lawn of West Berlin’s Platz der Republik, a grassy square in front of the imperious Reichstag building. The building had once been the seat of the German government (and is again today) but in the late 1980s had stood largely unused since World War II due to its proximity to the Berlin Wall looming directly behind it. The tour had come to participate in the Concert for Berlin, an event held as part of the city’s 750th-anniversary celebrations, and when the performance venue was erected, its West Berliner organisers made sure that several speakers were pointing directly at the Wall. It was a cool evening when Bowie and company took to the stage beneath a 15-meter (50-foot), illuminated spider before an audience of some 80,000 fans. At the same time, listeners from the east gathered as close as they dared, their numbers accumulating steadily. Attendees to the west got their money’s worth, as Bowie rocked through a lengthy 24-song set followed by three encores. The tracks were largely drawn from his latest run of albums – Scary Monsters, Let’s Dance and Never Let Me Down – but a few harkened back to those he’d recorded a decade earlier while living in the city, most notably his anti-Wall anthem, “Heroes”. By all accounts the performance was well-received by those watching from the Reichstag. Bowie himself later expressed that it was an emotional experience. For those listening to the east, however, the music may have been welcome, but the atmosphere was oppressive as members of the Volkspolizei – the People’s Police, a civilian wing of the much-feared Stasi secret police – spent the duration of the concert hassling and intimidating those who had congregated to hear it. The following evening as the crowd swelled precipitously for a second day of music, violence erupted when East German authorities cracked down on eastern listeners – a repressive act that only inflamed opposition and ultimately contributed to theWall’s collapse. At the time, Berlin sat at the crux of the Cold War. In the wake of World War II, the victorious powers had chopped Germany into four regions, each occupied and administered by one of the United States, the USSR, the United Kingdom and France. But with Berlin situated deep inside the Soviet zone, it was agreed that the capital, too, would be divided along similar lines. Then in 1961, following years of rising tension, the Soviets boxed in the western Allied section of the city with a heavily fortified and guarded barrier – the infamous Berlin Wall – which divided families and severed economic and social ties. “It’s hard for any of us to really imagine,” says Berlin Wall historian Hope M Harrison, professor of history and international affairs at George Washington University. “This was a world metropolis like New York, London, Paris, Rome – and suddenly to have it divided in two!” Families were separated, employees cut off from their jobs, students from school. “It had a huge, devastating impact on the people of Berlin. “For Berlin, it was a gash through the city,” Harrison explains. “For the world, it symbolised two things: the Cold War – here it is in concrete – but also both the brutality and simultaneously the weakness of the Communist regime.” That the powers that lay to the east felt it necessary to wall its people in was “a kind of admission of defeat”, she added. Life on both sides of the barrier became increasingly grim. Those to the east experienced pervasive censorship and a rapid diminishing of material standards due to the food and supply shortages that plagued the Soviet Union. Those in West Berlin settled into their besieged enclave, where greater cultural freedom allowed for wide-ranging artistic experimentation, but the sense that it was all teetering on the brink persisted. “West Berlin very much became a countercultural place,” says Harrison, gravitating artists, punks, anarchists, and East Germans looking to escape compulsory military service. “It was living on the edge, so it attracted people who were happy to live on the edge, some of them with the Berlin Wall literally in their back yard or across the street.” “That’s why I went to Berlin,” said Bowie, who moved to West Berlin in 1976 at the age of 31. “I wanted to have another kind of friction … people living under the impression that everything might collapse very quickly.” Drowning in the recent superstardom brought on by The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and accompanied by flat-mate and then-floundering former Stooges frontman Iggy Pop, Bowie ostensibly went to Berlin to escape the raging cocaine addiction that had prompted his previous handful of albums – particularly Station to Station, the production of which Bowie later reported he had little to no recollection. Raised in Bromley, not far from London, he had gone to the US in 1974 but, after two years of maximalist rockstar debauchery across New York City and Los Angeles, the singer was desperate for change. The Thin White Duke (as he was monikered during his Station years) was in a transitional mode and Iron Curtain-era Berlin seemed an appropriate environment for this modulation. “I knew I had to get to an environment that was totally different from Los Angeles,” he explained towards the end of 1977. “The most arduous city that I could think of, and it was West Berlin. It’s a very good, therapeutic city for an artist.” By the time Bowie arrived in Berlin, its Cold War culture conflict was in full swing and music played no small part in the struggle. That same year, famed German folk singer Wolf Biermann had his East Berlin citizenship revoked while he was away performing in West Berlin, barring him from returning home: His crime – writing a song critical of the Stasi that was sung among its prisoners. Western music was largely banned in the east, though East Germans still received radio and television transmissions from the other side of the Wall, as well as smuggled cassette tapes and records cut into medical x-ray films known as “ribs”, “jazz on bones”, or “bone music”. “It’s a very tight life there, surrounded by a wall with machineguns,” Bowie said of life in West Berlin. “The longer you live there the more it comes in, and the Wall by the end feels as though it’s right around the apartment or house you’re staying in.” In fact, Bowie could see the Wall from Hansa Studio, where he finished his 11th and 12th albums, Low and Heroes, and produced Iggy’s second solo release, Lust for Life. Hansa is still there today, just around the corner from sections of the Wall displayed in the square of Potsdamer Platz (which Bowie mentioned in “Where Are We Now?” 30 years later, a song largely about the day the divide finally fell – November 9, 1989). These days, it is flanked by a fashionable shopping centre and the luxurious Ritz-Carlton hotel rather than the armed guard towers that enforced the division of the city for some three decades. It was beneath one of those towers that Bowie spied the inspiration for Heroes’ titular track. Producer Tony Visconti and singer Antonia Maass would steal away to kiss in the shadow of the Wall during recording sessions; Bowie used the image of that as a symbol of the power of love over oppression. “It’s about what it means to be a hero and stand up,” said Harrison. “I think this song is very relevant right now. Standing up against what you feel is wrong and shameful.” Over the ensuing decades, the song Heroes went on to become the most recognised anthem from what was dubbed Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, but what is most distinct about Heroes the album and its forerunner Low are their least-known tracks: The synth-driven, largely lyricless compositions that comprised the second side of both records. “I needed to discover for myself a new form of musical language before I continued writing,” Bowie explained. “Low and Heroes aren’t so much situations, but a process of discovery. Searching for a new artistic language so that I can go further.” Going further meant leaving something behind, and it was in Berlin that he killed off the characters behind whom he’d long hidden – Major Tom, Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, Halloween Jack, the Thin White Duke – and embraced an identity he had heretofore obscured: Himself. “I never wanted to appear as myself on stage ever,” he said in 1979, shortly after leaving Berlin for the Isolar II World Tour – said to be his healthiest tour in years due to the noticeable reduction in cocaine use – “until recently.” When you compare the interviews Bowie gave before and after Berlin, it’s plain to see that he had undergone a fundamental change during the roughly 18 months he lived there. Before, there was a dolled-up rock star trying to bluff away nerves. After, he seemed remarkably mature, calm and clear-eyed. Escaping the throttle of cocaine probably didn’t hurt, but it was something more than that. As he explained to interviewers who commented on the shift in his dress and demeanour during the closing years of the 1970s, he had come down from the astral antics of Ziggy and the megalomania of the Duke and humbled himself among humanity. Gone were the pomp and flash of fame, and here now was this very normal-looking guy with bad teeth. Visiting Hansa in 2025, one might get the impression that Bowie lived a lavish lifestyle in Berlin – such is the studio’s increasingly gentrified neighbourhood today. But things were very different in 1976, when he rented a small apartment at 155 Hauptstraße in nearby Schöneberg – a working-class district largely populated with Turkish immigrants and artsy gays – where Bowie churned out hundreds of paintings that he was too self-conscious to show anyone. “They’re all portraits of people in isolation,” he later explained. “Most of the paintings are Germans or Turks who live in Berlin … from East Berlin and now living in West Berlin knowing their families are on the other side of the Wall.” In the 20 years before Bowie’s arrival, some 650,000 Turkish workers had come to Germany as part of a bilateral agreement with Turkiye to supplement a steep labour shortage. Many brought families, and over the course of two decades developed a thriving, visible migrant community in Berlin and beyond. Looking at the paintings you can recognise the influence of Bowie’s favourite painter, the German expressionist Erich Heckel – declared “degenerate” by the Nazis – whose Roquairol inspired the cover art for both Heroes and Iggy’s 1974 solo debut The Idiot. Today you can see Heckel’s work at the Brucke Museum, which Bowie frequented during his time in Berlin. The subject matter of Bowie’s paintings hints at the transition he was undergoing. In the lyrics throughout Low and Heroes – with the notable exception of the latter’s title track – he maintained his early-career tendency towards introspection, sometimes to the point of outright wallowing. But with his hallucinatory portraits of struggling Turks and Germans, suddenly he was turning his gaze outward and examining the hardships of others rather than his own. This inclination came to a head with the overlooked and much-maligned finale to the Berlin Trilogy, 1979’s Lodger. To say that Lodger fell flat would be an understatement. It was one of the worst-selling records of Bowie’s career. Critics tore it apart, declaring it “self-plagiarism” and complaining of its “droning mood pieces”. Many claimed it was not a proper Berlin album at all; it wasn’t recorded there and was tonally divergent from the first two instalments. Some went so far as to accuse Bowie of marketing gimmickry through his saddling of a lesser album to its more powerful predecessors. But with the benefit of hindsight, one might determine that Lodger was in fact the logical conclusion to his time in the city – that it was a Berlin recording because it was a direct response to the social and political plight he encountered there. It is perhaps the most human album he created in the first three decades of his career – a record about real people, immigrants and world affairs, critical of society and almost optimistic in its teasing of it, unlike the introverted Cold War starkness of Low and Heroes. Consider its opener, “Fantastic Voyage”, in which Bowie warns about the dangers of apocalyptic nuclear brinkmanship, reminding those in charge that “Dignity is valuable, but our lives are valuable too.” It’s a song that champions life in the face of the political mood swings that threaten disaster, urging humanity over geopolitical partisanship – one of the few songs from the era that Bowie continued to perform well into the new millennium. Or “Yassassin” – Turkish for “Long Live” – which explores the struggles of Turkish immigrants facing bigotry and violence at the hands of native Germans, an issue that feels all too relevant in contemporary Berlin, home as it is to many African migrants and refugees from Syria and Ukraine amidst a rising tide of nationalism. To continue: The mock-toxic (moxic?) masculinity of “Repetition” and queer-coded “Boys Keep Swinging”. His sardonic swipe at the vapidity of the music industry in “DJ”. Then wrapping up the album with “Red Money”, which concludes with the line, “Such responsibility/it’s up to you and me.” These are the songs of someone who has moved beyond the glamour of rock stardom to embrace the humanitarian power of the platform. A decade later, Bowie would return for the Concert for Berlin. The three-day event was organised by Radio in the American Sector (RIAS 2), a station that was notorious for broadcasting Soviet-banned music to both sides of the city. Held in an open-air venue and featuring performances from the likes of the Eurythmics and Genesis in the days to follow Bowie, one promoter later asserted that the show was, at least in part, an intentional provocation of Eastern authorities. The concert brought thousands of East Berliners crowding to their side of the barrier hoping to hear, and inspired what was supposedly the first public demonstration against the partition. By the second and third days of the concert, eastside police had violently attacked listeners and demonstrators, arresting at least 100 people. This, many have since claimed, was the last straw, once and for all shifting public opinion firmly against the Soviet state. “These concerts and Western music were listened to widely in East Berlin and East Germany,” says Harrison. “These icons singing so close, just on the other side of the Wall, certainly for many drove home this division.” There were more concerts to come associated with the East-West Berlin conflict. In July 1988, Bruce Springsteen performed in East Berlin to an audience of 300,000 at the invitation of officials who thought his working-class image would suit communist propaganda, only to have it backfire when the Boss made statements in favour of tearing down the Wall. “The Wall is very famous for how it fell,” notes Harrison. “Unexpectedly and in fact by mistake. We should never overlook the role of chance.” Following months of large-scale protests and the piecemeal disintegration of the East/West German border, it finally all came down to one man – an East German official named Gunter Schabowski – who, on November 9, 1989, declared the border open before an international news conference after misreading instructions that were merely a modification of travel restrictions. Now East Berliners surged towards the Wall hoping to cross in a scene captured by Bowie in the track “Where Are We Now?”: Twenty thousand peopleCross BosebruckeFingers are crossedJust in case Bosebrucke was one of the border checkpoints overwhelmed by East German masses that night, including a young Angela Merkel – the future chancellor of a unified Germany. Footage of jubilant masses from both east and west celebrating atop the barrier was broadcast around the world. They started the work of dismantling it that very night, using sledgehammers and saws to tear it down brick by brick and panel by panel, though the demolition wouldn’t begin in earnest until the following year. On New Year’s Eve 1989, David Hasselhoff headlined the Freedom Tour Live concert attended by 500,000 people from both sides of the Wall. Its climax came when Hasselhoff sang his hit “Looking for Freedom” while a crane raised him above the Wall alongside the Brandenburg Gate, long inaccessible to those in the east due to its location just a few metres into the west. Officials began the official teardown in June 1990, and East and West Germany were reunified into Germany as we know it today on October 3. The writing was now on the wall for the Soviet Union, which collapsed over the ensuing year, dissolving formally on December 26, 1991. While Harrison doesn’t attribute the Wall’s fall to Bowie – it is hard to argue that it wasn’t driven by the wider socioeconomic, geopolitical situation – some Germans prefer the legend to the reality as evidenced by a tweet from the German Foreign Ministry upon the singer’s death in January 2016: “Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall.” Today, little remains to mark Bowie’s time in Berlin, except the music. There is Hansa Studio where he recorded it, which displays in its window the singer’s constantly shifting portrait. Or you can have a drink at his old boozing spot, Neues Ufer – German for “New Shore” – which was supposedly the first gay bar in town back in 1977. But just down the street from the bar, at Hauptstraße 155, is the most striking memorial to Bowie’s stint in the city: The graffiti-haloed bust of Aladdin Sane – one of his most famous alter-egos – emerging from the building facade, candles and votive offerings on the stoop below, a plaque above explaining the Berlin Trilogy and bearing the words “We can be heroes, just for one day.” Just above is the second-storey apartment Bowie called home for a year and a half, and it was here among struggling Turkish immigrants and German families separated by the Wall that he tore down his own barriers and metamorphosed from self-centred rock star to socially aware artist. Now, nearly 35 years after the Wall fell, with old divisions cropping up once again in Germany and the wider world, the story of Bowie and the Berlin Wall suggests important lessons. That there can be great creativity and beauty even through calamity. That the human compulsion towards freedom cannot be caged. That life is full of changes. That walls come down. “To so many people,” concludes Harrison, “the peaceful fall of the Wall showed that something you think will never end can, in fact, end. It made many people feel that anything is possible.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on imports from Colombia after Bogota initially refused deportation flights. The United States and Colombia pulled back down from a trade war on Sunday, after hours of heated exchanges between their leaders in public. After Colombia refused to accept two US military aircraft with Colombian citizens deported from the US, Washingtonthreatened tariffs and sanctionson Bogota. The US is Colombia’s largest trading partner. US President Donald Trump and Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petrotraded barbs onlineuntil late on Sunday, with Colombia eventually agreeing to accept deportees and the US claiming victory. Here is more about what happened — and what was at stake for Washington and Bogota. Colombian President Petro refused to let two US military aircraft carrying deported Colombian migrants land, amid Trump’s intensifying crackdown on migration to the US. He accused Trump of not treating the deported migrants with dignity or respect. Petro reposted a video on X showing deportees in an airport in Brazil, with their hands and feet restrained. “I cannot allow migrants to remain in a country that does not want them; but if that country sends them back, it must be with dignity and respect for them and for our country,” he wrote. In 2022, there were an estimated 240,000 unauthorised Colombian immigrants in the US, according to areportby the US Department of Homeland Security. Petro offered to send a presidential plane to facilitate the return of the migrants, which he argued was more dignified than how the US was sending them back. Trump hit back, accusing Petro of jeopardising US security. Threatening tariffs and sanctions, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday: “These measures are just the beginning. We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said on Sunday that he was authorising visa restrictions on those Colombian officials and their families “who were responsible for the interference of US repatriation flight operations”. As the back-and-forth continued, Trump upped his threats, ordering 25 percent tariffs on all Colombian goods coming into the US. These tariffs, he warned, would then be raised to 50 percent in the following week. In addition, Trump said he would impose “visa sanctions” and a “travel ban and immediate visa revocations” on government officials and their family members and supporters, while tightening border inspections of all Colombian nationals and cargo. In retaliation to Trump’s threats, Petro threatened to also impose 25 percent tariffs on US goods. The Colombian president posted a series of defiant messages on X on Sunday, responding to Trump’s threats. “Your blockade does not scare me, because Colombia, besides being the country of beauty, is the heart of the world,” he wrote in one of them. “The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals,” Petro wrote on X, also pointing out that there are “15,660 Americans irregularly settled in Colombia”. The row was resolved late on Sunday. Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo told a news conference that officials had “overcome the impasse” and would accept citizens deported from the US. He added: “The government of Colombia … has the presidential plane ready to facilitate the return of Colombians who were going to arrive in the country this morning on deportation flights.” Colombia’s statement additionally said that Murillo and Colombia’s ambassador to the US would, in the upcoming days, travel to Washington to continue diplomatic dialogue and ease tensions. The White House echoed this in a statement, saying Colombia had agreed to all of Trump’s terms, including “unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on US military aircraft, without limitation or delay”. Both sides would have been hurt had the tariff war gone ahead. Between January and November 2024, the US imported goods worth $16bn from Colombia, according to US Census data. The US receives its largest supply of cut flowers from Colombia, importing nearly two-thirds, or 66 percent of its cut flowers from the country, according to 2022 data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). Valentine’s Day, coming up on February 14, would have pinched Americans more had the tariffs kicked in. The US also sources just over 20 percent of its imported coffee from Colombia — only marginally behind Brazil, the largest supplier of coffee to the US. The US also imports crude petroleum, gold, aluminium structures, bananas, and coffee and tea extracts from Colombia — but in much smaller quantities. Colombia is among the rare group of countries that have a trade deficit with Washington. In other words, the US exports more to Colombia than it imports from the South American nation. While a trade war would have made specific goods — like flowers and coffee — costlier for US consumers, it would have had larger implications for Colombia’s economy, impacting both its exports and imports. “These measures would have significant political and economic implications,” Victor Munoz, a visiting fellow at Germany-based think tank, European Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera. “For Colombia, such actions could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs, particularly in sectors like oil and gas, gold, coffee, and flowers,” he explained. The US is the largest trading partner with Colombia in terms of both imports and exports, according to OEC data from 2022. A quarter of Colombia’s exports go to the US, and the imports from the US comprise 26.4 percent of Colombia’s total imports. “Colombia has been working for decades to expand its commercial partnerships and diversify its international relations. However, expecting Colombia to immediately replace the export destinations for its products and services or the scale of US investments is unrealistic in the short term,” Munoz said. Between January and November 2024, Colombia imported goods worth $17bn from the US, according to US Census data. The US sent about $2.5bn worth of petroleum products to Colombia in 2023, making petroleum products the US’s most valuable export to Colombia. The next most valuable export was corn, at $1.2bn in 2023, and chemicals, at $1bn in the same year. Colombia also imports soybean meal and planes, among other things, from the US. “Tariffs could also trigger a devaluation of the Colombian peso, increasing economic risks and exerting inflationary pressure due to the rising costs of imported goods and raw materials,” Munoz said. “Such measures would undoubtedly create substantial economic and social impacts in the affected countries like Colombia.” A deportation flight is a flight sending unauthorised immigrants to their country of origin. However, this is the first time US military aircraft are being used to deport immigrants, according to an unnamed US official, Agence France-Presse reported. Deportation is not new, and the US began deporting immigrants starting as early as 1892, when 2,801 immigrants were removed, according to the Department of Homeland Security. However, the number skyrocketed starting in the 1990s. When Democratic US President Joe Biden took office in 2021, he had promised to pause deportations, but he expanded them, recently deporting the highest number of immigrants in nearly a decade – more than 271,000 over the last fiscal year. Between 2021 and 2024, the US expelled 28,635 Colombian citizens, according to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) website. Nearly half of these were in the fiscal year of 2024. But Trump contested the 2024 election on accusations that the Biden administration allowed “hordes” of undocumented immigrants to enter the country, also making unsubstantiated claims suggesting that countries were sending violent criminals to the US. He promised that he would carry out the “largest deportation operation in history”. Meanwhile, Trump has also made clear that he intends to use tariffs as a weapon. He has threatened stringenttariffstargeting countries including China, Mexico and Canada.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "title": "On the Auschwitz anniversary, Europe cannot ignore its far-right problem",
        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "Far-right leaders may be paying respects today, but their power reflects the growing threat of genocidal violence in Europe. On January 27, 1945, the largest Nazi concentration and extermination camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, was liberated. An estimated 1.3 million people were deported to Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945 and 1.1 million of them were murdered. As Europeans mark the 80th anniversary of this dark chapter of history, their leaders are releasing statements about the “civilisational rupture” the Holocaust represented and the need to “resist this hatred”. Yet, many of these declarations do not seem to take stock of the political reality in Europe, in which the successors of the fascist and Nazi forces behind the Holocaust are now gaining popularity and even taking power. Of course, far-right parties and figures have repeatedly paid their respects to Holocaust victims and pledged to combat anti-Semitism, but that does not mean they have relinquished their Nazi and fascist past. Rather, they have undertaken a strategic realignment which – with the help of the political mainstream – allows them to retain and propagate the same dangerous ideas of white supremacy and hatred. So how did we get here? For decades, Europe’s far right openly embraced anti-Semitism. Figures like Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the National Front in France, and Jörg Haider, founder of the Freedom Party in Austria, disrupted the political consensus of post-war Europe by embracing Holocaust denial rhetoric. They were vocal in expressing their hatred but they remained on the margins of political life. However, over the past few decades, and especially with the start of the US-led “war on terror”, the far right gradually shifted its rhetoric towards open Islamophobia. Far-right leaders, like Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, portrayed themselves as defenders of Western civilisation against a new “enemy”: the Muslims. They adopted Christianity – and, symbolically, Judaism – as cultural markers to rally the majority who embrace the “values” of the “Judeo-Christian world” against their contemporary “other”. They played on people’s fears related to globalisation and immigration by using Islamophobic imagery, claiming Muslim communities are a threat and immigration from the East – an invasion. This rhetoric not only reflects the framing of the Muslim world that the “war on terror” imposed but also fits into the narrative that Israel embraced in justifying its continuing oppression and occupation of the Palestinians. It is not surprising then that the far right finally embraced Israel. While in the past, they questioned Israel’s right to exist, they now question a Palestinian state’s right to exist, referring to Palestine as Judea and Samaria. In 2010, after a trip by far-right leaders from Austria, Belgium, Germany and Sweden, their parties signed the so-called Jerusalem Declaration, which expressed the commitment of these forces to Israel’s “right to self-defence” from “Islamic forces”. This strategy of swapping anti-Semitic rhetoric and beliefs for Islamophobic ones, while embracing the violence of Israel, has proved to be quite successful. As a result, today, at the 80th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust, the far right is the strongest it has been since World War II. The political landscape of 2022-24 reflects this success. In 2022, Giorgia Meloni and her post-fascist Brothers of Italy won the Italian snap elections; she became the country’s first far-right female prime minister. In the 2023 Dutch elections, Wilders’ far-right party came out first and after months-long negotiations, formed a coalition government. In 2024, Portugal, which had long lacked strong far-right representation, saw the Chega party grow its parliamentary seats from 12 to 50. In France, the National Rally came in third in terms of parliamentary seats but won the popular vote. In the UK, Reform UK became the third largest party with 14 percent of the vote; it is currently polling at 25 percent, one percentage point behind the ruling Labour. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) claimed victory in elections in the state of Thuringia. In Austria, the Freedom Party won the national elections with 29 percent of the vote and is set to lead the government. At the European level, the far right was able to form the third-largest group in the European Parliament called the “Patriots for Europe”, following the elections in 2024. They adopted the slogan “Make Europe Great Again”. While the far right’s rise is a victory for its own movements, it also reflects the failures of Europe’s political establishment. Centre-right parties have largely embraced anti-immigration and Islamophobic politics, legitimising these positions rather than challenging them. Meanwhile, centre-left parties have struggled to address these issues effectively, leaving them vulnerable to the so-called culture wars. The mainstream’s failures in government have led to growing socioeconomic discontent, especially among the working class, which the far right has also managed to take advantage of. In a number of countries, the far right was excluded from government for years and served as a uniting factor for centrist parties in coalition negotiations. But that is no longer the case, as the growing number of coalitions that include the far right across Europe demonstrate. The time of this so-called cordon sanitaire is largely over. This normalisation of the far right has emboldened it more and more to the point that its members are no longer shy about sharing publicly their extremist ideas. In Austria, the Freedom Party openly talked about “remigration” as part of its election campaign last year, while a member of the AfD called for a “Srebrenica 2.0 in Germany” among her peers. These calls represent an updated form of the same anti-Semitic and racist ideologies that led to the horrors of the Holocaust. The defence of whiteness has simply switched its “enemy” from Jewish to Muslim people. The white supremacy and replacement theory remain the same and are at the core of today’s far-right ideology. The dramatic rise of the far right and its normalisation of racism and genocidal intent cast a long shadow over the European mainstream’s insistence that the Holocaust was a “civilisational rupture”, that it was unique and exceptional. The ideologies and forces that led to the Holocaust have historically produced imperial genocidal violence outside of Europe. And they are still very much present in European politics. That means the threat of such genocidal violence continues. That is made quite apparent in the staunch support for the genocide in Gaza by some European countries and the denial that it is taking place. In this context, the solemn statements released today to mark the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz ring hollow. Eighty years after the end of the Holocaust, the resurgence of the far right is a chilling reminder of the fragility of European commitment to “never again”.

        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "Shock to financial markets comes from Chinese firm whose AI app it says was made at a fraction of US AI models. Wall Street’s superstars are tumbling as a competitor from China threatens to upend the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has created a spending bonanza. The S&P 500 was down 1.7 percent in midday trading on Monday and heading for its worst day in more than a month. Big Tech stocks took some of the heaviest losses with Nvidia down 14.4 percent, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down 2.8 percent. Stocks outside AI-related industries held up much better, though, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 54 points, or 0.1 percent, as of 11:05 am in New York (16:05 GMT). The Dow, whose companies have much less of an emphasis on tech than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, had briefly been on track for a small gain earlier in the morning. The shock to financial markets came from China, where a company called DeepSeek said it had developed a large language model that can compete with United States giants at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek’s app had already hit the top of Apple’s App Store chart by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the US government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said in a post on X on Sunday that DeepSeek’s R1 model was AI’s “Sputnik moment”, referencing the Soviet Union’s launch of a satellite that marked the start of the space race with the US in the late 1950s. “DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world,” he said in a separate post. Scepticism, though, remains about how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the AI supply chain from the chipmakers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centres gobbling up computing power. “It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many sceptics around this issue, given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.    DeepSeek’s announcement nevertheless rocked stock markets worldwide. In Amsterdam, Dutch chip supplier ASML slid 6.6 percent. In Tokyo, Japan’s Softbank Group Corp lost 8.3 percent to pull closer to where it was before leaping on an announcement trumpeted by the White House that it was joining a partnership to invest up to $500bn in AI infrastructure. And on Wall Street, shares of Constellation Energy sank 19 percent. The company has said it would restart the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to supply power for data centres for Microsoft. All the worries sent investors towards bonds, which can be safer investments than any stock. It’s a sharp turnaround for the one-time AI winners, whose stocks had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Before Monday’s drop, Nvidia’s stock, for instance, had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years. Other Big Tech companies had also joined in the frenzy, and their stock prices had benefitted too. It was just on Friday that Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg was saying he expected to invest up to $65bn this year while talking up a datacentre Meta is building in Louisiana that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan. A small group of such companies has become so dominant that they’ve come to be known as the “Magnificent Seven”. These companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — alone accounted for more than half of the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Their immense sizes in turn have also given them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. It shows the risk of betting too much on just a few winning stocks, something that market experts call “concentration risk”. That “can feel good when those few names or ideas are on the ascent, but it is even more dangerous when disruptions take place”, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Still, he suggested not overreacting to Monday’s sharp swings. “It is possible that the news out of China could be overstated, and then we could see a reversal of the recent market moves,” Jacobsen said. “It is also possible that the news is true, but then that would present new investment opportunities.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "title": "Why are there so many Palestinian children in Israeli prisons?",
        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "Twenty-three child prisoners released but more than 300 minors remain in Israeli custody, many of them without charges. At least 23 Palestinian child prisoners have been released by Israel as part of the ceasefire deal, bringing into focus Israel’s systematic prosecution of Palestinian children in military courts. At least 290 Palestinian prisoners have been released in two batches since the Hamas-Israel ceasefire came into effect on January 19, ending 15 months of nonstop Israeli bombardment of Gaza. According to Adameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, a rights group based in the occupied West Bank, 320 children were being held in Israeli prisons before the latest prisoner exchanges. So, what do we know about Palestinian child prisoners and why are they tried in military courts? In 2016, Israel introduced a new law allowing children between the ages of 12 and 14 to be held criminally responsible, meaning they could be tried in court as adults and be given prison sentences. Previously, only those 14 or older could be sentenced to prison. Prison sentences cannot begin until the child reaches the age of 14, however [PDF]. This new law, which was passed on August 2, 2016 by the Israeli Knesset, enables Israeli authorities “to imprison a minor convicted of serious crimes such as murder, attempted murder or manslaughter even if he or she is under the age of 14”, according to a Knesset statement at the time the law was introduced. This change was made afterAhmed Manasrawas arrested in 2015 in occupied East Jerusalem at the age of 13. He was charged with attempted murder and sentenced to 12 years in prison after the new law had come into effect and, crucially, after his 14th birthday. Later, his sentence was commuted to nine years on appeal. An estimated 10,000 Palestinian children have been held in Israeli military detention over the past 20 years, according to the NGO Save the Children. Reasons for the arrest of children range from stone-throwing to participation in a gathering of merely 10 people without a permit, on any issue “that could be construed as political”. Controversially, Palestinian prisoners are tried and sentenced in military rather than civil courts. International law permits Israel to use military courts in the territory that it occupies. A dual legal system exists in Palestine, under which Israeli settlers living in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem are subject to Israeli civil law while Palestinians are subject to Israeli military law in courts run by Israeli soldiers and officers. This means that a large number of Palestinians are imprisoned without basic due process. “Israeli authorities, however, regularly arrest Palestinian children during nighttime raids, interrogate them without a guardian present, hold them for longer periods before bringing them before a judge and hold those as young as 12 in lengthy pretrial detention,” Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in November 2023. Nearly three-quarters of Palestinian children in the occupied West Bank were kept in custody until the end of proceedings, compared with less than 20 percent for Israeli children, according to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel’s report from 2017. HaMoked, a human rights NGO assisting Palestinians subjected to human rights violations under the Israeli occupation, said minors being held in prisons were allowed a 10-minute phone call to their families once every two weeks during 2020. Israel released 200 Palestinian prisoners, 120 of them serving life sentences, from its jails on Saturday as part of the ceasefire deal. Two of them were children, both 15 years old. The oldest prisoner, Muhammad al-Tous, was 69. He had spent 39 years in jail, having first been arrested in 1985 while fighting Israeli forces.  The swap on Saturday was the second exchange since a ceasefire came into effect on January 19. Three Israeli captives and 90 Palestinian prisoners (69 women and 21 children) were released in the first swap. Only eight of the 90 prisoners were arrested before October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led Palestinian groups carried out attacks in southern Israel. The attacks killed more than 1,100 people, saw about 250 taken captive and triggered Israel’s devastating war on Gaza.  Some Palestinian prisoners have been held in Israeli prisons for more than three decades. Prominent Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti – who was the co-founder of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, also known as Fatah, the party that governs the West Bank – has been in prison for 22 years. Tamer Qarmout, an associate professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera that the release of Palestinian prisoners is a “huge relief” for families, although it is happening under the “horrible realities of [the Israeli] occupation”. “These prisoners should have been released through a bigger deal that ends the conflict, that brings peace through negotiations, through ending occupation, but the harsh reality in Palestine is that as we talk, occupation continues,” Qarmout told Al Jazeera. As of Sunday, about 10,400 Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank were in Israeli captivity, according to estimates from Addameer. In the occupied Palestinian territory, one in every five Palestinians has been arrested and charged at some point. This rate is twice as high for Palestinian men as it is for women – two in every five men have been arrested and charged. There are 19 prisons in Israel and one inside the occupied West Bank that hold Palestinian prisoners. Israel stopped allowing independent humanitarian organisations to visit Israeli prisons in October, so it is hard to know the numbers and conditions of people being held there. Palestinian prisoners who have been released have reported being beaten, tortured and humiliated before and after the start of the war on Gaza on October 7. About 3,376 Palestinians being held in Israel are under administrative detention, according to Addameer. An administrative detainee is someone held in prison without charge or trial. Neither the administrative detainees, who include women and children, nor their lawyers are allowed to see the “secret evidence” that Israeli forces say forms the basis for their arrests. This practice has been in place against Palestinian detainees since the establishment of Israel in 1948. These people have been arrested by the military for renewable periods of time, meaning the arrest duration is indefinite and could last for many years. The administrative detainees include 41 children and 12 women, according to Addameer. Twenty-six other captives should be released in the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, along with hundreds more Palestinian prisoners. The next exchange is next Saturday. Many hope the next phase will end the war that has displaced the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and left hundreds of thousands at risk of famine. Talks start on February 3.

        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "Announced in Florida, Trump’s latest orders also target military diversity programmes and transgender service members. United States President Donald Trump has announced he would sign an executive order calling for the construction of an “Iron Dome” missile defence programme. On Monday, Trumpaddresseda retreat for Republican lawmakers at his south Florida golf resort, the Trump National Doral Miami, where he pledged to bolster US military assets with executive action later in the evening. “We have to have a strong, strong defence,” Trump said from the podium. “And in a little while, I’ll be signing four new executive orders.” The first, he explained, was to “immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defence shield, which will be able to protect Americans”. Two more orders, he added, would be aimed at removing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and getting “transgender ideology the hell out of our military”. A fourth order would also reinstate service members who were discharged for refusing to comply with mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 8,000 members had been discharged for that reason between August 2021 to January 2023. Trump framed the actions as necessary to ensure the US has “the most lethal fighting force in the world”. Monday’s announcement marked yet another ripple in a tsunami of executive actions Trump has undertaken since returning to the White House on January 20. According toofficials, Trump signed a record number of executive actions on his first day in office, amounting to a total of 42 orders, memorandums and proclamations. Many of those initial orders pertained to immigration and social issues. For instance, he made a move to end birthright citizenship, a constitutionally protected right that endows anyone born in the US with citizenship. But some of his early executive orders overlapped with those unveiled on Monday. He called for the end of governmentDEI programmes, which heaccusedof perpetrating “illegal and immoral discrimination”. And he signedanother orderdeclaring that male and female gender identities are “not changeable”. But the latest raft of orders deals directly with the makeup of the US military and its strategic priority. Monday’s orders, for example, echo a “transgender military ban” that Trump pursued in 2017, during his first term in office. That ban was later reversed by President Joe Biden in 2021. An estimated 8,000 service members are transgender – though more may fear to identify themselves publicly. The executive orders Trump unveiled also coincided with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s first day at the Pentagon. Hegseth, a veteran and former Fox News host, has previously railed against what he described as a “woke” ideology overtaking the military and questioned whether women should serve in combat roles. As head of the Pentagon, Hegseth haspledged to overseea vast overhaul of the military leadership and restore a “warrior culture” in the armed forces. Hesgeth overcame allegations of sexual abuse and alcoholism to be confirmed to his post by 50 Republican senators on Friday. Three Republicans, including former Senate party leader Mitch McConnell, opposed his nomination.    Trump’s executive order to build an “Iron Dome” fulfils a pledge the Republican leader made on the campaign trail. The Iron Dome refers to a US-fundedair defence systemin Israel that detects and intercepts incoming rockets. Trump had repeatedly described his desire to top Israel’s Iron Dome system in his campaign for re-election in 2024. In an August broadcast on the social media platform X, he told billionaire Elon Musk he planned to build “the best Iron Dome in the world”. And in July, he added the Iron Dome proposal to the Republican Party’s official platform. But military experts have repeatedly questioned whether such a system is necessary, or even feasible, for the US. The system used in Israel currently only protects against relatively low-power rockets and mortars. And Israel itself is only about the size of New Jersey, one of the US’s smaller states. Experts say creating a similar system across the vast US mainland would be cost-prohibitive, not to mention possibly ineffective, given the advanced firepower of potential adversaries like Russia and China. Observers also point out that the US already has missile defence programmes in place, including the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) programme. The future of Trump’s Iron Dome project is also unclear, as it is all but assured to require funding appropriated by Congress. “You know, we protect other countries, but we don’t protect ourselves,” Trump said on Monday. “Now we have phenomenal technology. You see that with Israel where, out of 319 rockets, they knock down just about every one of them. So I think the United States is entitled to that.”             Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "The symbol, apparently created by Israeli tanks, can be seen from space in the Palestinian enclave. Zooming in on newly released satellite images of what used to be farmland in northern Gaza, the outline of what clearly appears to be a Star of David is carved into the ground. The symbol of both the Jewish faith and the state of Israel can be seen in images of Beit Hanoon, an area of northern Gaza that has seen extensive fighting and losses for the Israeli military. Next to the star appears the numbers 7979, a possible reference to the Israeli military’s97th Netzah Yehuda Battalion. The Netzah Yehuda Battalion, an all-male ultra-Orthodox unit, was reported to have deployed from the occupied West Bank to Gaza in January last year and has operated in Beit Hanoon. Before its deployment, the battalion had been accused of numerous violent crimes, including what some United States officials said could amount to gross violations of human rights, including the killing of unarmed Palestinians and the torture and sexual abuse of prisoners in its custody. Among the battalion’s alleged victims was a Palestinian American man in his 80s,Omar Abdulmajeed Asaad, who died during his arrest by the Netzah Yehuda Battalion in January 2022. After pressure from the US government,Israel agreed to pay compensation to Asaad’s familylater that year. However, as part of the payout, the Israeli government insisted that no one in Netzah Yehuda be held accountable for Asaad’s death. The Netzah Yehuda Battalion made the Star of David “for Google Maps, to be seen that they were here”, Hamze Attar, a Palestinian defence analyst, told Al Jazeera. Attar said the act could have been a response to plans by the administration of former US President Joe Biden to sanction the battalion. In August, however, the US Department of State ended its investigation into breaches of its own Leahy Laws, which prohibit thetransfer of weapons to overseas military unitsinvolved in gross human rights violations, following objections by the Israeli government. The investigation had been focused on Netzah Yehuda.    “We’re seeing what absolute impunity looks like in an army that is given everything it needs to destroy Palestinian life,” said Elia Ayoub, researcher and author of theHauntologies newsletter. “As in any genocide, those committing them often take pleasure in displaying their superiority by forcing their symbols on their victims. The Israeli army also utilises religious figures who speak of this genocide of Palestinians and the colonisation of Gaza as a religious duty.” Al Jazeera has contacted the Israeli Ministry of Defence regarding the Star of David etched into northern Gaza but did not receive a response by the time of publication. The Star of David is not the first symbol left by Israeli forces. In Gaza, images uploaded to social media have shown soldiers putting up giant menorah candles or drawing Jewish symbols in the wreckage of buildings. Soldiers have done the same in southern Lebanon since Israel invaded in October. “The [Israeli military] has rabbis on the ground, and soldiers have brought the menorah and shofar to the battlefield,” Ayoub said. “This is not new. It’s just much more widespread now. The Israeli religious philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz described these attitudes as that of Judeo-Nazis in the 1990s, warning that it could become the norm if not stopped. Sadly he was right.” A ceasefire on January 19 brought an end, at least temporarily, to Israel’s attacks on Gaza carried out since the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel of October 7, 2023. Those killed 1,139 people and took about 250 people captive. Israel’s subsequent war on Gaza has killed at least 47,306 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded another 111,483 whiledisplacingabout 1.9 million of its 2.3 million people. According toresearch by Jamon Van Den Hoekof Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the City University of New York, 60 percent of all buildings in Gaza have been destroyed by Israeli forces since the war began. In Beit Hanoon, the figure is 70 percent. The issue of Gaza’s future beyond the war received added relevance last week after US President Donald Trump’s suggestion that the Palestinian inhabitants of the enclave be “cleaned out”. The forced displacement of Gaza’s entire population has been a cornerstone of the Israeli far right for decades. Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has often spoken of his desire to re-establish Israeli settlements within Gaza, welcomed Trump’s suggestion, pledging: “I will, with God’s help, work with the prime minister and the cabinet to ensure there is an operational plan to implement this as soon as possible.”    “Branding is about ownership. It’s about marking your territory,” said Chris Arning, the founder and director ofCreative Semiotics, a consultancy specialising in the meaning of brand symbols. “Branding originally came from tradespeople marking their products or farmers branding their cattle to signify ownership. Over time, that also included the branding of convicts and slaves.” The carving of the Star of David into the soil of Beit Hanoon can be seen as an act of symbolic violence, Arning said, referring to the violence that symbol represents in the local context. “In many ways,” Arning continued, “it’s branding the land.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "content": "Israel says next release of captives will take place on Thursday, followed by another on Saturday. Israel says a Hamas list shows that eight of the 33 captives to be released in the first phase of theGaza ceasefire agreementare dead. Government spokesman David Mencer told journalists on Monday that Hamas said the other 25 are alive. Israel overnight said it had received a list of information on the status of the captives from Hamas. “The families have been informed of the situation of their relatives,” Mencer said, without providing the names of the deceased. Israel has said the next release of captives will take place on Thursday, followed by another on Saturday. Approximately 90 captives are still being held. Prior to this announcement, Israel believed at least 35 of them were dead. The truce deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict, announced earlier in January after months of fruitless negotiations, took effect on January 19, bringing to a halt more than 15 months of devastating war on Gaza sparked by the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks. Under the first phase of the agreement, 33 captives held in Gaza are to be released in exchange for more than 1,900 Palestinians held by Israel. Seven Israeli womenhave been releasedsince the start of the truce, as have 290 Palestinian prisoners.    Two Israeli women, Arbel Yehud and Agam Berger, are to be released on Thursday along with a third unidentified captive, following negotiations between Hamas and Israel. Their upcoming release was announced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday night as part of the truce agreement with Hamas. According to Israel, Arbel Yehud, as a woman and a civilian, should have been released last Saturday in the second prisoner exchange of the ceasefire deal. When she did not appear, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the agreement and in retaliation prevented displaced Palestinians from returning to the north of Gaza. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and said it had informed mediators that Yehud was alive and gave guarantees for her release. On Monday, following Hamas’s pledge to release Yehud and other captives this week, the blockage was lifted. As a result, hundreds of thousands ofdisplaced Palestinians in Gazabegan to make the journey back to destroyed homes in the north of the Gaza Strip later on Monday for the first time since the devastating war began. The United Nations said more than 200,000 people were observed moving north in Gaza on Monday morning alone.   According to UN data, about two-thirds of all buildings in Gaza were destroyed or severely damaged during the conflict, and approximately 90 percent of Gaza’s 2.1 million residents were displaced. The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that the death toll from Israel’s war on Gaza had reached 47,317, with numbers rising in spite of the ceasefire as new bodies are being found under the rubble. The ministry said hospitals in the Gaza Strip had received 11 bodies in the past 24 hours – nine bodies recovered after the truce, and two new fatalities. It did not specify how the new deaths occurred. The ministry said Israeli attacks also wounded at least 111,494 people. At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023 and more than 200 taken captive.             Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "content": "January 27 marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the notorious Nazi extermination camp in Poland. “The sky was red, and the air smelled like burned meat. I didn’t understand it then, but my mother told me it was people. People like us.” —Ceija Stojka, Auschwitz survivor Eighty years ago, the Soviet Red Army liberated survivors of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazi extermination camp in the Silesian region of southern Poland. The arrival of the Allies gave the world its first real glimpse of the horrors of the camp — even though there is evidence that British and American intelligence agencies knew of the industrial-scale killings in Auschwitz concentration and extermination camps. More than one million people, the vast majority of them Jews, were murdered at the Auschwitz camp, which operated from May 1940 until its liberation on January 27, 1945 – now observed as International Holocaust Remembrance Day in honour of the victims. Other victims included the Roma, Polish political prisoners, homosexuals, communists, Soviet prisoners of war and disabled people. We look back at what happened at Auschwitz, the way different categories of victims were treated, and the testimonies of some of the survivors. The Nazis, driven by their ideology of racial supremacy and territorial expansion, established more than 44,000 camps that served a range of purposes across Germany and its occupied territories from 1939 to 1945. This vast network was known as the “Lager”, where between 15 and 20 million people were imprisoned or killed. It included concentration camps for “undesirable” ethnic groups and political prisoners; labour camps where enslaved prisoners carried out industrial or agricultural work, including for German firms such as the IG Farben chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate and the Krupp engineering company; transit camps for holding detainees before deportation to other camps; and six extermination camps where people were taken to be murdered. Auschwitz was a complex that had many of these types of camps. It was also the largest of the Nazi death camps. People were sent to Auschwitz from transit camps across Europe and from labour camps if they were deemed unfit to work. Some were sent from Auschwitz to other locations to be used for forced labour elsewhere. After the Nazis invaded Poland in September 1939, they converted Auschwitz, an army barracks, into a set of more than 40 camps, of which Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau were the two most significant facilities. Auschwitz became a central part of the Final Solution, the German plan for the genocide of Jews. Auschwitz I was established in 1940, primarily for Polish political prisoners, and later expanded to include Jews and others. It also served as the administrative centre of the complex. Situated near the town of Oswiecim in southern Poland, the camp was strategically connected to a dense network of railways, allowing the efficient transport of those it imprisoned from locations across Europe. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was built in 1941 and 1942 in the nearby village of Brzezinka (Germanised as Birkenau), about 3km (1.9 miles) from Auschwitz I. It functioned as the largest extermination and forced labour camp in the Nazi system, equipped with gas chambers and crematoria. Along with Einsatzgruppen paramilitary death squads, Auschwitz was the single biggest killing machine during the Holocaust. Approximately 1.3 million people were held in Auschwitz over its four years of operation – at least 1.1 million of them, the vast majority Jewish, were murdered. Auschwitz handled up to 90,000 prisoners at any one time. Inmates carried out various duties within the camp, such as cleaning, administrative work, supervising other inmates or performing the grim task of pulling bodies out from gas ovens, removing any gold teeth and women’s hair, and burning bodies. They were also marched off to do hard labour in outside locations such as factories, quarries and farms, where inmates would work by day and return to their camps at night. Auschwitz was also a site for medical experiments and pseudo-scientific research, using the inmates as guinea pigs. Dr Josef Mengele, known as the “Angel of Death”, was infamous for his horrific experiments at Auschwitz, particularly on twins and individuals with physical anomalies. These experiments involved injections of chemicals into the eyes to attempt to change eye colour, deliberate infection with diseases to study immune responses and the dissection of one twin after death to compare with the surviving sibling. In mass sterilisation programmes targeting minorities such as the Roma and people with disabilities, victims underwent forced exposure to radiation targeting reproductive organs, injection of caustic chemicals into the uterus or testicles and surgical sterilisation without anaesthesia. Jews made up 90 percent of the victims of Auschwitz while other groups were also sent to the camp. Each was targeted for specific reasons, and life in the camp differed significantly depending on the group to which prisoners belonged. “It is not possible to sink lower than this. No human condition is more miserable than this.” — Primo Levi, Italian Jewish chemist, author, and Auschwitz survivor Jews were the principal target of the Holocaust and the worst sufferers – by far – of Nazi brutalities. Between 1939 and 1945, some six million Jews were murdered across Europe. They were gassed, shot, or starved and worked to death. Of those murdered, nearly 1.1 million Jews were killed at Auschwitz alone – about 85 percent to 90 percent of the camp’s victims – making it the deadliest Nazi extermination camp. Jewish prisoners at Auschwitz faced some of the harshest and most brutal conditions of all the prisoner groups. The Nazi racial ideology targeted Jews for extermination above all others. In his 1947 memoir, Survival in Auschwitz (If This Is a Man), Primo Levi described how he was immediately subjected to the “selection” process on arriving at the camp in January 1944. Those who failed the fit-to-work test deemed unfit for labour were sent to the gas chambers. In all, 75 to 80 percent of Jewish deportees were immediately sent to the gas chambers on arrival. Jews had to live in overcrowded barracks, with as many as 1,000 prisoners crammed into spaces designed for 400. They received minimal food rations, leading to starvation and extreme malnutrition. Sanitation was almost non-existent, with limited access to water or latrines, leading to rampant disease. Levi, on arrival stripped of his personal belongings, shaved, tattooed and given a uniform, was assigned to gruelling forced labour, enduring starvation, freezing temperatures, disease and the constant fear of death. “We had to move like automatons,” he wrote, “following orders mechanically, to avoid attracting attention and punishment”. Jewish inmates worked under constant abuse and beatings from SS (Schutzstaffel, a paramilitary organisation) guards and “kapos” — fellow inmates who agreed to work as supervisors for the Nazis — often until they collapsed and died. Jews were also singled out for especially humiliating and dehumanising treatment, such as being forced to witness or participate in public executions, stand naked for hours or endure beatings. Jewish women often faced sexual violence. Though he eventually survived and later went on to become a highly acclaimed author of many books, Levi remained haunted throughout his life by the traumas he had experienced during the Holocaust. He eventually took his own life in 1987. “The screams of the children still echo in my ears. They screamed until they were no longer there.” —Ceija Stojka, Roma Auschwitz survivor An estimated 23,000 Roma were deported to Auschwitz, mostly between February 1943 and July 1944, of whom 19,000 perished. Defined as “racially inferior”, the Roma were placed in a designated “Gypsy family camp”, or “Zigeunerlager”, located in the southern part of Auschwitz II-Birkenau and adjacent to the gas chambers and crematoria. Among those sent to Auschwitz was Stojka, the fifth of six children born to Roman Catholic Roma parents who made their living as itinerant horse traders. Their family wagon travelled as part of a Roma caravan that spent winters in the Austrian capital of Vienna and summers in the Austrian countryside. In her 1988 memoir, Stojka relates that she was five years old when Germany annexed Austria in March 1938. Her parents were ordered to remain in Vienna and convert their wooden wagon into a permanent house. Stojka remembers them having to learn how to cook with an oven instead of an open fire. In 1940, Roma families received new orders from the Nazi regime to register as members of a non-Aryan race. The settlement where Stojka lived was fenced off and placed under police guard. Stojka was eight when her father was taken away to the Dachau concentration camp; a few months later, her mother received his ashes in a box. Soon afterwards, Stojka, her mother, and siblings were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where the mother and children were crammed with thousands of others into overcrowded barracks with little food or water. They lived in the shadows of a smoking crematorium. “Auschwitz was like hell on Earth,” Stojka said. “The smell of burning flesh was constant, and it became part of our lives – part of our breath.” The camp was overcrowded, filthy and rife with disease. Roma prisoners were kept on the edge of starvation and often subjected to brutal medical experiments, particularly the children. Death rates were extremely high due to disease and malnutrition. Stojka described how she would helplessly watch as prisoners, including children, were selected for medical experiments or sent to be eliminated by gassing. “In Auschwitz, we were no longer people,” Stojka wrote. “We were numbers, things to be disposed of, with no value except the work we could do before we died.” In mid-1944, Stojka, her mother, and siblings were transferred to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in central Germany – miraculously escaping the so-called “liquidation” of Birkenau’s Roma. On August 2, 1944, SS guards, with their rifles and dogs, surrounded the camp. The inmates initially resisted, with whatever tools, sticks and rocks they could use as weapons. They were soon overpowered, dragged to the gas chambers and murdered with the Zyklon B cyanide-based pesticide. The Roma Family Camp massacre was part of the broader Nazi genocide of Roma people, known in the Romani language as the Porajmos (“Devouring”). At least 220,000, and possibly as many as 500,000, Roma were murdered in the course of the Porajmos, representing 25 to 50 percent of their pre-war population. Stojka and her family members were moved from Ravensbruck to yet another facility, Bergen-Belsen, in north-central Germany, from which she was liberated on April 15, 1945, weighing just 28kg (62 pounds). “The hardest part was the psychological terror – the idea that you could be executed at any moment for any reason made the fear constant.” — Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, member of the Polish resistance, Auschwitz survivor Some 150,000 Polish intellectuals, clergy, educators and resistance members were sent to Auschwitz in a German effort to suppress any opposition to Nazism and hinder the country from rebuilding after the war. While harsh, their treatment was generally less brutal than that of Jewish prisoners. Even then, about 75,000 Poles were killed at Auschwitz. Many Polish political prisoners were given administrative roles within the camp, which sometimes meant privileges like better food or clothing. Among the Polish resistance members held at Auschwitz was Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, who was arrested by the Gestapo in 1940 and sent to Auschwitz. In a 1988 interview with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Bartoszewski described that immediately on arriving in the dead of night, he and others on his train were “thrown into a muddy yard, and immediately subjected to the brutality of the SS guards”. “They shouted at us, beat us with clubs, and forced us to strip. We were herded into the barracks like cattle, overcrowded and filthy. There was no space to sleep, and the smell of death was already present.” Bartoszewski was assigned to work in the commander’s kitchen. But despite that job, he and his comrades were fed barely enough to survive, and he witnessed many prisoners dropping dead from exhaustion and hunger. Some imprisoned Poles succeeded in forming underground resistance networks to provide mutual aid and sabotage camp operations, making use of the fact that Auschwitz was situated in their own country. They gathered information about the Nazis’ plans, movements of goods and extermination efforts, and smuggled this data to Polish resistance leadership and Allied forces. “I remember one night, during roll call, when we overheard some SS officers discussing a mass transport of prisoners being sent to the gas chambers the next day,” Bartoszewski, who later became Poland’s foreign minister, recalled. “We managed to secretly alert others, which allowed many to avoid the selection process. It wasn’t a victory, but it was a small act of defiance that gave us hope.” Resistance figures also destroyed or altered records to delay the identification and deportation of prisoners, and played a key role in documenting the systematic killings at Auschwitz. They sabotaged industrial operations, slowing down work and damaging equipment, organised escape routes and smuggled food, medicine and other essentials into the camp – all at great personal risk, as those caught helping prisoners were usually executed. As the war progressed and supplies depleted, conditions worsened for Bartoszewski and all the other prisoners in Auschwitz. When the Nazis ordered inmates to line up and walk out under the shadow of their guns in January 1945, as the Soviets approached, many, like Bartoszewski and Levi, were too weak to leave. Both survived until the Soviet troops reached Auschwitz. Most people held in Auschwitz did not. Many conscientious objectors were held in Auschwitz, including some 3,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses who refused to serve in the military or swear allegiance to Hitler, even under torture. Jehovah’s Witnesses were not kept separately from other prisoners, but could be identified by a purple triangle on their uniforms. Although treated less harshly than other groups, they too were subject to starvation and forced labour. Jehovah’s Witnesses conducted secret Bible readings and prayers, both of which were strictly forbidden, and often shared their meagre rations with other prisoners who were weaker or in worse condition. They also refused to engage in the camp’s hierarchical brutality, such as becoming kapos – supervisors of forced labour – or participating in acts of violence against fellow inmates. Simone Arnold Liebster, a Jewish French survivor of Ravensbruck (another concentration camp located in central Germany), would later describe the kindness and spiritual strength of the Jehovah’s Witnesses she knew during her imprisonment, noting: “Their steadfastness and peace gave me strength to endure. They reminded me that even in the darkest places, kindness and faith could survive.” Tens of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war were held in Auschwitz, treated as “subhuman” according to Nazi ideology, and often kept in dire conditions, with little food and no medical attention. Although positioned near the bottom of the Nazi hierarchy of prejudice, they were not subjected to the systematic genocide directed at Jews and Roma. However, they were usually assigned to the harshest forms of slave labour, such as construction or forestry work in sub-zero temperatures, with many, if not most, perishing from starvation, cold and disease. Aleksei Vaitsen, one of the few Soviet prisoners of war to survive Auschwitz, later said: “We were stripped of everything – our uniforms, our dignity and our humanity. To them, we were not soldiers. We were animals.” Other Auschwitz inmates included homosexual men, who were identified by a pink triangle sewn onto their uniforms and subjected to brutal experiments to “cure” their sexual orientation. Also held at Auschwitz were people with disabilities, deemed “unworthy of life” under Nazi eugenics policies that aimed to create a “racially pure” Aryan population by promoting selective breeding and eliminating those deemed “unfit”. This included the forced sterilisation of some 400,000 individuals with hereditary conditions, mental illnesses or other disabilities. Under the “T4 Programme” of euthanasia, about 300,000 disabled people, including children, were systematically murdered in gas chambers, with injections or through starvation. At Auschwitz, many of these disabled prisoners were subjected to horrific medical experimentation at the hands of Mengele and his associates. Another class of Auschwitz prisoners were German and Austrian common criminals, arrested for theft, murder or other non-political crimes, who were identified by the green triangles on their uniforms. As Aryan citizens, these inmates occupied a higher status among those imprisoned, with many being appointed kapos, allowing them benefits such as better food rations. The kapos were notorious for abusing other prisoners, especially Jews and political detainees. However, a few of these criminal prisoners resisted, helping fellow inmates or refusing to carry out SS orders. In mid-January 1945, approximately 60,000 Auschwitz prisoners were marched westwards to other concentration camps, ahead of the Soviet advance. On these so-called “death marches”, they staggered for days in freezing temperatures with little food or clothing. Thousands died from exhaustion, starvation or exposure, and many others were shot by SS guards along the way. The liberation of Auschwitz itself took place on January 27, 1945, when Soviet troops from the 60th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front entered the camp. They discovered about 7,000 remaining survivors, including 700 children, most of whom were severely emaciated, sick or dying – those too weak or ill to join the death marches. The Soviet troops found piles of corpses and ashes, gas chambers and crematoria, as well as warehouses filled with victims’ belongings, including shoes, clothing and human hair. The liberation exposed the scale of Nazi crimes to the world and became a defining moment in the history of the Holocaust.

        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "M23 fighters have been pressing to capture the key city of Goma for months and intensified their offensives in recent days. The M23 rebel group hasdeclaredthe key city of Goma under its control, signalling a major blow to the Congolese army and a serious escalation in the years-long conflict that has seen hundreds of people killed and millions displaced in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Goma’s reported capture on Monday came after M23 – which the United Nations says is backed by neighbouringRwanda– advanced rapidly on Congolese army positions last week. Throughout the day, a barrage of gunfire and explosions rocked the city, which is the capital of North Kivu province and a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts. Hundreds of thousands of residents and previously displaced people fled to neighbouring towns in panic. Social media footage showed huge crowds moving on foot and motorbikes, carrying luggage on their heads and backs. The crisis, which reignited in 2022, has displaced millions of civilians in the eastern DRC. More than 237,000 people were displaced in January alone, according to a recent report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Here’s what you need to know about M23’s ambitions and the latest fighting:  M23, or the March 23 Movement, is one ofhundreds of armed groupsoperating in the eastern DRC and seeking to control critical mineral mines. The group is composed of Tutsi fighters and claims to be fighting for the rights of the DRC’s minority Tutsi population. It emerged in 2012 after a group from the armed forces of the DRC (FARDC) broke away, complaining of ill-treatment. The DRC government and the UN accuse Rwanda under President Paul Kagame of supporting M23 with soldiers and weapons in a bid to control the mineral-rich eastern DRC. Rwanda denies the charge and accuses the DRC of harbouring members of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, an anti-Kagame rebel group that was involved in the1994 Rwandan genocide. The UN estimates there are up to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers in the DRC. In 2012, M23 first seized Goma, but the Congolese army, supported by a UN force, pushed the rebels back into the eastern hills on the border with Rwanda in 2013. However, the DRC faced a resurgence of M23 violence in 2022. The group has since advanced on Goma, seizing territory in battles with the Congolese army and two peacekeeping missions: the UN mission to the DRC (MONUSCO) and the South African Development Community (SADC) Mission in the DRC. South African troops, as part of the UN mission, were crucial in the 2013 defeat of M23. European mercenaries from France, Romania and Belarus also support the Congolese army. M23 has intensified its offensive on Goma since the beginning of the year, capturing nearby towns like Sake and Minova along the way. On Friday, Major General Peter Cirimwami, the military governor of North Kivu province, waskilledon the front lines. Civilians from M23-captured areas fled to Goma although they were unsure of their safety there. “We are going to Goma, but I heard that there are bombs in Goma too, so now we don’t know where to go,” Adele Shimiye told The Associated Press news agency. Others fled to border crossings with Rwanda where immigration officials carefully checked travel documents. On Saturday, M23 said it would capture Goma and warned the army and peacekeepers to surrender by 3am (01:00 GMT) on Monday. At a UN Security Council emergency meeting on Sunday, officials condemned the M23 advance and confirmed that 13 peacekeepers were killed from Friday to Saturday. South Africa said nine of its soldiers were killed trying to fend off M23’s advance on Goma while the UN said three Malawian soldiers and one Uruguayan were also killed. Bintou Keita, the UN’s special representative to the DRC, said at the meeting that nonessential UN staff had begun evacuating but warned that“we are trapped”as M23 declared the airspace over Goma closed and roads to the city were blocked. Meanwhile, the United States, United Kingdom and France warned their citizens to leave Goma as residents poured out of the city.    On Sunday night about 10:30pm (20:30 GMT), M23 fighters entered Goma amid heavy gunfire and explosions. Residents posted videos on social media showing heavily armed M23 fighters wearing military clothes and patrolling the main streets. About 100 government soldiers released their weapons to Uruguayan MONUSCO troops on Sunday night while hundreds of European mercenaries are also believed to have surrendered their weapons after M23 threatened to burn them alive, according to reporting by Sky News. “More than a hundred FARDC soldiers are sheltered in the facilities of the ‘Siempre Presente’ base awaiting the [disarmament, demobilization and reintegration) process,” the Uruguay army said in a statement on X on Sunday. In a statement on Monday, M23 said it had “liberated” Goma and urged those remaining in the city to “remain calm”. The group also ordered Congolese troops to “hand over” their weapons to MONUSCO and gather at the central stadium. Goma was largely quiet on Monday, but gunfire rang out in parts of the city, including near the airport, in the city centre and on the border, the Reuters news agency reported. Congolese special forces and government-aligned militia were still engaging M23 rebels on the outskirts of the city, residents said. Corneille Nangaa – the leader of the Congo River Alliance, which includes the M23 – told Reuters on Monday that his forces were in control of Goma. “They [Congolese army soldiers] have started to surrender, but it takes time,” he said. Meanwhile, there are reports that rebels looted and attacked infrastructure. The AFP news agency reported a jailbreak at a Goma prison on Monday after which the jail was torched. “Goma’s capture by the M23 is a massive setback for the DRC authorities,” Vincent Rouget, an analyst at Control Risks, a global security consultancy, told Al Jazeera, adding that the layout and positioning of the city also present challenges. “You have the volcano on one side, the lake on the other, and it’s in extremely close proximity to the Rwandan border. That means that once you have lost Goma, it’s going to be extremely difficult for the DRC army to recapture the city militarily,” he said. Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya, in a statement posted on X on Monday, announced the presence of the Rwandan army in Goma. “The government continues to work to avoid carnage and loss of human life in view of the manifest intentions of Rwanda,” he said, telling residents to stay home and refrain from carrying out vandalism and looting. In a video posted on X, he called for the protection of civilians and said the DRC was “in a war situation where the news is changing”. DRC President Felix Tshisekedi has not yet commented. Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner said at the UN Security Council meeting on Sunday that Rwandan troops crossing the border into Goma was a “declaration of war” by Rwanda and the DRC was severing all diplomatic ties. Wagner also called on countries to sanction Rwanda. Rwanda’s UN ambassador, Ernest Rwamucyo, did not confirm or deny the DRC’s claims at the meeting but said the DRC could have averted the crisis if it had “demonstrated a genuine commitment to peace”. Kenyan President William Ruto – chairman of the Eastern African Countries (EAC) regional bloc, to which the DRC and Rwanda belong – called for an emergency meeting of EAC leaders by Tuesday, saying the region had a “critical responsibility in de-escalating violence and facilitating dialogue” between all sides. Ruto also said he spoke to Tshisekedi and Kagame on Sunday evening and both leaders confirmed attendance at the EAC meeting. “It’s the best prospect for a ceasefire,” an analyst in Goma who spoke on condition of anonymity told Al Jazeera. “At the moment, the situation is quite dicey because the weapons they’re using are not meant for urban warfare.” Rouget said that in the lead-up to Monday, it looked like there was a “decisive push” by M23 and its backers to cut Goma off from resupply routes linking it to other Congolese cities, adding: “The timing of the push is probably not coincidental.” “One thing we had said for a while is that the main backer of M23, according to the UN group of experts – that is, Rwanda – was not going to be willing to risk the massive PR backlash of an operation in Goma. But the change in the administration in the US potentially may have played a role in changing the calculation there and the thinking that, actually, the diplomatic blowback may not be as severe as once feared,” he told Al Jazeera. At the Security Council meeting, the US called for a ceasefire and urged Rwanda to withdraw support from M23. Acting US Ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea warned that Washington would “consider all the tools at its disposal” to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining the conflict. Meanwhile, France has sided with the DRC. “As Goma prepares to fall, France expresses its solidarity with the Democratic Republic of Congo and its territorial integrity. France firmly condemns the offensive,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Monday. All eyes are on Ruto as analysts look to see how the EAC will try to negotiate a ceasefire. Previousceasefires negotiatedby Angola were violated by both sides. “[Capturing Goma] puts the M23 in a much stronger position to be able to continue its offensive,” Rouget said. “We’re not necessarily at the end of the group’s progression in eastern Congo. We can see further clashes, further progressions into other cities.” Goma’s capture could also dramatically worsen one of Africa’s longest wars and displace thousands more civilians, analysts said. More than a third of the population of North Kivu is displaced, according to the UN. Diplomatic tensions between Rwanda and South Africa are also likely to deepen after the death of the peacekeepers last week, the unnamed analyst in Goma told Al Jazeera, adding: “It won’t be business as usual between Rwanda and SADC.” Already, the two governments have less than warm relations: Assassinations of Rwandan dissidents in South Africa in 2014 were traced to Kigali, leading both sides to temporarily sever diplomatic ties. Jason Stearns, a researcher on the DRC, said countries like the US can take action to halt Rwanda’s support of M23. “In the past, donors have used that leverage,” Stearns wrote in the Financial Times this week, referring to 2012 when the US and other Western countries withdrew aid to Rwanda and when M23 was subsequently defeated. But “this time around we seem to be living in a different world, one in which migration, business investments, and national concerns are more important than humanitarianism, and where apathy trumps solidarity,” he wrote.

        "title": "A ‘revolving door’ for political prisoners? Venezuelan families cry foul",
        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "As President Nicolas Maduro begins his third term, families continue to call for the release of activists and dissidents. In August, activist and engineer Jesus Armas attended a vigil for Venezuela’s political prisoners: some who had been swept up in a recent postelection crackdown and others who had languished in jail for years. The then-37-year-old listened to impassioned speeches, gazed at posters emblazoned with the faces of those behind bars, and silently lit a candle in their honour. But four months later, on December 10, Armas was carted off to prison himself. Witnesses saw hooded men seize him from a cafe in the capital Caracas and bundle him into a silver vehicle with no licence plates. For days, no one knew where he was. Only in mid-December did his family discover he was in government custody. Now, his loved ones are among those attending vigils, wistfully lighting candles for him. “We feel incomplete. Every day is exhausting,” said his girlfriend, Sairam Rivas. She described Armas as an affectionate person who loves music and helping people. “It’s distressing to have a person who is missing, to never be able to see them, to not know how they are or what conditions they are in.” In the lead-up to this month’sinaugurationof PresidentNicolas Maduro, Venezuela released hundreds of political prisoners, many rounded up in last year’s post-election unrest. But human rights groups warn this does not signal an easing of Venezuela’srepression. New prisoners, including Armas, have been added to the state’s collection of detainees. “The effect is a revolving door,” said Genesis Davila, a lawyer and founder of Defiende Venezuela, a human rights organisation that presents evidence of rights violations to international organisations like the United Nations. Venezuela has not stopped arresting political dissidents, she explained. “The government is just being more selective about who it takes.”  Last year’s contested presidential election shone a spotlight on Venezuela’s human rights record — and its track record of politically motivated arrests. On July 28, Venezuelans cast ballots for their next president, and shortly after polls closed, election officialsdeclaredMaduro, the two-term incumbent, the winner. But the result was announced without the usual breakdown of voting statistics, and theopposition coalitionquickly cried foul. It released what appeared to be copies of the official voting tallies, showing that Maduro had lost by a wide margin. Protestserupted, calling for Maduro to step down. But Venezuelan security forces attempted tostifle the demonstrationswith a heavy-handed crackdown, resulting in 25 people killed and nearly 2,000 detained. Still, in the lead-up to Maduro’s inauguration on January 10, the government touted the fact that it had released nearly1,515of those swept up in the post-election violence. Butarrestshave continued. On January 7, Enrique Marquez, one of Maduro’s election rivals, was taken. That same day, the leading opposition candidate in the race, Edmundo Gonzalez, announced his son-in-law Rafael Tudares Brachohad been abductedin front of his children. His whereabouts remain unknown. As of January 20, there were 1,601 political prisoners held by the state, according to the Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal. It logged 83 new arrests in the first 12 days of January alone. Gonzalez himself remainsin exile, after Venezuelan authorities issued awarrantfor his arrest in September on charges that include usurping power. ‘State terrorism’ to instil fear  Armas had been part of Gonzalez’s campaign for the presidency last year. An outspoken activist with a broad smile, warm eyes and a crop of dark brown hair, Armas had long wanted to see change in Venezuela — a country that was once the richest in South America. Bountiful oil reserves had brought record prosperity to Venezuela in 1970, but in subsequent decades, notably in the 1980s and 2010s, oil prices dropped. The country’s economy has since struggled with issues like high inflation, corruption, crumbling infrastructure and foreign sanctions. Decrying the decline of Venezuela’s institutions, Armas founded a nonprofit, Ciudadania Sin Limites, in 2012 dedicated to improving access to essential public services in underserved communities. But his family believes it was his role in the 2024 presidential campaign that led to his arrest — and subsequent torture. Rivas said she spent six days looking for Armas after his abduction, only to be met with denials from public prosecutors, judges and other officials. No one seemed to know where he was. She found out later that Armas had already gone before a court. He had not been allowed to choose his own lawyer: A public defender had been assigned instead. Rivas was eventually able to see Armas for a 15-minute visit at a detention facility known for rats and other unsanitary conditions. “He told me he’d first been in a clandestine house for three days, suffocated with black bags and they asked him where opposition leaders were,” Rivas said. Armas has since been transferred to El Helicoide, a shopping centre turned detention facility in Caracas with a reputation for torture. According to a Decemberreport, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found that Venezuela had used “state terrorism” to instil terror in citizens after the election. Among its tactics were extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and “cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment”. ‘I have cried too much’  Diana Sosa, who is using a pseudonym for fear of repercussions, said she spent a month searching for her 18-year-old son, a student, after he was arrested in the days after the election. Eventually, she too discovered he was in a government detention facility, not far from the city of Maracay. Sosa now rents a room near the detention facility, five hours away from her home, so she can take him food and attend the visiting sessions permitted once every 15 days. This month’s flurry of new detentions has left her overwhelmed with panic. Sosa has become apprehensive about her own safety and that of her family at home. “I wonder if they will kidnap me without my relatives knowing where I am. I’m so afraid for my other son back home, away from my protection and care,” Sosa told Al Jazeera. But she also continues to fear for her son in prison. Through tears, she recalled how his lips were white when she recently visited him. He told her he had resorted to eating balls of rolled-up toilet paper to treat the diarrhoea he had contracted. “I saw him dehydrated, his eyes sunken and his gaze vacant. It was a dull, faraway look, and that killed me,” Sosa said. “I have cried too much for what my son has lived through and for how vilely they have treated him.” The Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners in Venezuela (CLIPPVE) has collected similar testimonies from ex-prisoners, as well as the friends and family of those still detained. In areportreleased in December, the committee raised serious concerns about the conditions inside Venezuela’s prisons. Pasta in some detention centres was allegedly topped with rotting meat. Strands of hair were found in plates of beans. And some food was reportedly served in a state of decomposition, with cockroaches and worms mixed in. The report said prisoners developed stomach problems from the food. Many also didn’t have access to drinking water. False promises  Despite the recent announcements of prisoner releases, representatives from CLIPPVE remain sceptical. Some, like Sosa, were promised their loved ones would be freed, but that has yet to happen. “There is a lot of anger because the authorities have used the releases in a very opaque and obscure way,” a representative from CLIPPVE, who also has a family member in prison, told Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity. Some families have even faced reprimand and threats of arrest for protesting the continued detention of their loved ones. Rivas, who is part of CLIPPVE, underscored that continuing to fight is imperative. As attention fades, so too does the pressure on the government to release the prisoners. “I am very aware that the worst thing that can happen to a political prisoner is oblivion,” Rivas said. For Davila, the need to raise awareness is at the heart of her mission at Defiende Venezuela. She has documented Armas’s case as well as many others. “At least by reporting to international organisations, we make sure that there is a record of the human rights violations that are occurring, because if we only relied on the organisations in Venezuela, we wouldn't have any record,” Davila said. Rivas, meanwhile, has not heard from her boyfriend in a month. He is no longer allowed visits or calls. Worse still, the threat of arrest now hangs over Rivas too. Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace Diosdado Cabello called Rivas out by name in his weekly television show, Con El Mazo Dando — a religious reference that loosely translates to “hitting with a club”. Critics have accused Cabello of using the platform to identify targets for political repression. “This has been quite distressing,” Rivas said. She added that she currently takes care of Armas’s elderly parents. “If we were both arrested, his parents would have no one to turn to.” Despite the risks, Rivas is resolute that silence is not an option. “Those who are detained are in that situation for defending the truth, for defending democracy,” she said. “Every day I am thinking about what we can do for the freedom of Jesus and other political prisoners — and to ensure the creation of historical memory in the country, so that these kinds of things never happen again.” Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "Amid all the celebrations of Donald Trump returning to power in the US, turncoat rappers kissing his ring have left the rawest wound. A few years ago, when reports came out that The Office star Ellie Kemper was crowned at the Veiled Prophet debutante ball, what critics called a Klan’s ball, I turned over and went back to bed. A week ago, when TikTok gushed over Donald Trump and did as much of a digital soft-shoe as possible, thanking the soon-to-be president for saving its presence in the United States, I blew out my lamplight and slipped back under the sheets. But it was something about 90s hip-hop stars joining the queue to kiss the ring at Trump’s inaugural balls that still keeps me up at night. For many of us Black millennials – especially those raised in working-class neighbourhoods – hip-hop was the oxygen of our childhood. It documented every inch of our lives, reflecting back to us the sounds and feelings of our existence in a way that no one else could or cared to. Our ordinary lives were mirrored in music even as it was demeaned or thought of as on the margins of real society. It was also a window to what we could be. It lit the path to a fate that was beyond the minimum-wage job or the waste of our lives in the “second childhoods” laid out before us. It let us fantasise about being conquerors of the straits of lumpen and working-class life. To dress well, to be gangsta or appealing, and have respect. More than that, it was a mind. It did not merely reflect the conditions of the neighbourhood, it was a conference of thought and clashing debates. We heard encouragement and a critique of intra-class antagonism when Aaliyah told us we “don’t need no Coogi sweater”. We saw visions of escape in Rich Boy’s Throw Some D’s and forced into quiet introspection after watching Pac’s Brenda’s Got a Baby and Latifah’s U.N.I.T.Y. One hour we were trying to commit to memory the adrenaline-rush poetics of Bizzy Bone’s entire Heaven’z Movie album and the next we were psyching ourselves up to meet the high school or street corner bully with Mobb Deep’s Shook Ones. We used this art as a soundtrack to what we knew they thought of as our disposable lives. It was the most accessible evidence to prove to ourselves that the world was lying to us about the “inferiority of Black people”. We didn’t need that well-intentioned white lady teacher pitying us for being Black, holding a poster with George Washington Carver with a jar of peanut butter, saying we, too, “contributed”. We had her on mute, the CD player spinning as we busily tried to decipher the hieroglyphics of Wu-Tang. So it was something else to see the intensity of our ghetto beauty being forced to fiddle for the discombobulated dancing of rich frat boys. To see our griots crouch to pick up dollars under the lowest of all intellectual ceilings: racism. To see it was our thinkers, too, who would play the white liberal game, squinting, pretending they could not tell if a Nazi salute is a Nazi salute. Turning their coat without being asked. Leaping even before theAnti-Defamation Leagueat the chance to give white supremacists the benefit of the doubt. Of all the daily bombardments of racism that have come to define this decade of settler supremacist resurgence, turncoat rappers have left the rawest wound. It is not easy to recover from witnessing our biographers reduced to being stool pigeons on a burning cross. Excuses were preemptively flowing. It was said “a check is a check”. It was said “this isn’t politics”. It was pretended that they don’t know what MAGA stands for and is trying to achieve. As if we didn’t know hip-hop is moreuniversitythan the university. I remember in the past scanning the channels and landing on Fox News mocking rappers’ dancing. Now, Fox News is reporting that Snoop Dogg “wows the crowd” at a pre-inauguration event. I remember Snoop Dogg talking about 187 and now I worry about the day I will see him waving a Blue Line Flag. In the 90s, white power campaigned to ban hip-hop. How complete is its victory that now it has it rubbing its feet? Nelly said but “he is the president”. But this is the point. There is no paucity of tracks that speak about our not being cool with presidents. One can start from any track by Dead Prez. In 1988, the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan entered the US presidential race. If he had won, then, were we to expect Eric B and Rakim to perform Microphone Fiend for “fans” in white hoods because “we support the troops”? How near are we to the day cop freestyle ciphers break out at a lynching? We may not have known it then, but it wasn’t only Black and Latin working-class life in North America that was carried along in the music. It was played in the Black poor’s spaces in South America, Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia. It was the music of the slums, the colonised’s counter-ideological weapon against the prison they kept us in. So it is a stomach stab to see our culture and lives being put to the service of the men who shout we steal pets and call our demand to be allowed to live “terrorism”. It trods on the morale of the people when our defenders are now tap-dancing for those who spray firehoses at the “woke” and stand back up the monuments to Confederate generals. You can only put so many more extensions on your pool house. Only drive so many cars in your lifetime. But “what does it worth” to sell yoursoulat the price of a noogie? To sign on todoing what they do, knowing your gifted mansion will never be more than massa’s outhouse? Of course, a few rappers taking photo ops with boys who no one would bet did not do blackface is not representative of all millennials’ hip-hop. But it’s not just them. Chuck D is fighting off the people coming for Elon Musk as he puts a spark plug to apartheid. Eve can’t get out of a still of Downton Abbey. Nor can Common from commercials. Nor can our beloved Black Thought, caged-bird singing from the “gilded cage” – the people’s oracle reduced to “the entertainment” forfascist-pettingJimmy Fallon. Still things fall apart and I should count my blessings. I would likely never get out of bed again if I saw Dead Prez or Lauryn Hill grab a fiddle. But it shouldn’t have been any of them. It was art for us, by us. It is heart-wrenching to witness our secret inner lives laid at the feet of empire, alongside our bodies. Theystole wokefrom Erykah Badu and beat us down with it. And now they have our master teachers abandon their posts to bounce baby settler supremacists on their laps. It is heartbreaking to see so many of our epic poets fall in line to kiss the ring of Jim Crow society’s warrior king. But maybe it is better this way. When Nas said hip-hop is dead, it may have been a prophecy. Or at least these “uncs of rap” may have outlived their relevance in the era of globalised apartheid. They are now rich and compromised. Millennials may have to abandon them and explore the colonised sector’s new music and new generation of artists, here and abroad, where, for now at least, we are nowhere close to radical Palestinian rappers being caught moonlighting as court jesters for Benjamin Netanyahu. Gen Z has spent half their lives staring directly into the eyes of open fascism and has been forced out to witness the public, viral lynching of the Black innocent daily. I see them every day. Nobody is tap-dancing. Their “mumble rap” – which we “old heads” have mocked – is not only more developed but more coherent than any rapper who says “f*** the police” from one side of their mouth and “let’s give the Confederacy a chance” from the other. As for drill, anticolonialism misdirected as horizontal violence in drill lyrics is more useful to Black liberation than a conscious rapper trying to find nuance in colonialism. Millennials’ hip-hop may abandon the slum, but the slum will have its day. It made hip-hop once; it can make another hip-hop. And when it does, it will stand over colonialism’s body, Buggin Out’s boombox on its shoulder, singing that old Black colonised sector’s spiritual, “It’s bigger thanhip-hop.” The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.

        "content": "In Pictures Fighting in and around the city has escalated despite calls from the UN Security Council for the rebels to withdraw. Residents in Goma, the largest city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), were fleeing on Monday after the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group claimed to havecaptured the regional hubfrom Congolese forces as fighting escalated despite calls from the United Nations Security Council for the rebels to withdraw. Gunshots rang out across Goma overnight before dozens of rebels in military uniform early Monday morning marched into the capital of North Kivu province, which sits on the border with Rwanda in the volatile region rich in minerals that are critical to much of the world’s technology. The Congolese government confirmed the presence of M23 rebels in Goma, 1,500km (930 miles) east of the capital Kinshasa, but stopped short of saying they were in control of the city. In a statement on X, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya asked Goma residents to stay at home and also urged Congolese nationals around the world to mobilise in support of the country. “No centimetre will be given up!!!” Muyaya wrote. The March 23 Movement (M23) is one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region in the decades-long conflict. The rebels temporarily took over Goma in 2012, before they were forced to pull out under international pressure, and resurfaced in late 2021, with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo’s government and UN experts. Rwanda has denied such support. Rwanda’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused DRC of failing to enter a dialogue with M23, which it described as a “Congolese rebel group fighting to protect their community”.

        "content": "As Belarus votes amid repression, what drives Alexander Lukashenko, the president likely to secure a seventh term. On January 26, Belarusians will cast their ballots in a presidential vote. Officially, there are five candidates, but 70-year-old Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for more than three decades, will almost certainly retain his seat. While Vladimir Putin’s Russia tolerated a degree of open dissent, at least until the invasion of Ukraine, Lukashenko was described for many years as “Europe’s last dictator” – a reputation which didn’t seem to faze him. “I am the last and only dictator in Europe. Indeed, there are none anywhere else in the world,” he told Reuters in 2012. Belarus’s opposition, the United States, theEuropean Parliamentand rights groups have dismissed the upcoming vote as a “sham”. The last presidential elections in 2020 kicked off mass protests amid widespread allegations ofvote rigging, followed by a brutal crackdown by the authorities. Experts and insiders say Lukashenko is driven by a “thirst for power” and, having been shaken by those demonstrations, the fear of losing control. “This desire for power has been driving him for 30 years. It does not let him relax for a second,” Valery Karbalevich, a political observer at Radio Liberty and author of an unofficial biography of Lukashenko, told Al Jazeera. “Power and life are the same thing … and he does not imagine his life without power.” Born in 1954 in the town of Kopys in northern Belarus, Lukashenko, a self-confessed troublemaker at school, was a Soviet pig farm manager before becoming president. The leader, who at times has made outlandish claims such as vodka and visits to the sauna being able to prevent COVID, is ruthless and distrustful, observers and those who worked under him say. “This man is capable of giving an order to kill if someone goes against him,” said Pavel Latushka, Belarus’s now-exiled former minister of culture from 2009 to 2012. “I had a conversation with him where he told me directly: ‘If you betray me, I will strangle you with my own hands.’ He later repeated this publicly in a recent [2024] interview with Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov.” As Belarus heads to the polls on Sunday, who is the man behind the leader and what motivates him today? Belarus, a landlocked nation of a little more than nine million bordering Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, was once part of the USSR. Like many leaders of former Soviet republics, Lukashenko’s political career began during that period. Unlike them, however, Lukashenko did not embrace nationalism and was theonly lawmakerin Soviet Belarus to vote against his country’s independence in 1991. Nostalgia for the Soviet era is reflected in much of Lukashenko’s governance. “He lived in the Soviet Union for more than 30 years and now, he cannot go beyond that life experience,” said Karbalevich. Lukashenko, then 39, won Belarus’s first, and so far only, presidential election deemed free and fair by outside observers in 1994. The independent candidate ran on a populist platform, pledging to root out corruption and railing against the “lawlessness” which he said held the country “hostage”. Immediately post-independence, Belarus suffered from a stagnating economy, corruption, inflation and racketeering gangs. While it is difficult to pinpoint when exactly Lukashenko developed distrustful tendencies, or whether he always had them, he survived an assassination attempt on the campaign trail when his car came under fire by unknown assailants. A state television documentary later claimed the attackers were working on behalf of high-ranking officials. Lukashenko won approximately 80 percent of the vote, defeating the country’s first prime minister, Vyacheslav Kebich, who inherited the job after independence and under whom quality of life had deteriorated. Within a year of assuming office, Lukashenko held a referendum that changed Belarus’s white-and-red flag to one closely resembling the old Soviet design. He told World War II veterans, “We have returned to you the national flag of the country for which you fought.” He maintained a planned economy, with state monopolies over industry and kept the collective farms open, winning the loyalty of the agricultural sector. This state-run economy prevented the emergence of powerful oligarchs dominating national politics, unlike in Russia and Ukraine, although a handful of businessmen with links to the government have prospered in recent years. “At the beginning of his presidency, he was really popular,” explained Karbalevich. “He considered himself the people’s president and told different stories about how the public loved him.” At a meeting of government officials in 2006, for example, Lukashenko boasted how bedridden war veterans practically stood up to make their way to voting booths. Karbalevich believes that back then, Lukashenko had a vision and wanted to go down in history as the man who “created the Belarusian statehood” and an alternative model to post-communist transition in other countries, but he also wanted the state to control the economy. To an extent, it proved efficient: unlike Russia, which was plagued by poverty and organised crime in the 1990s, Belarus was relatively safe and the inequality gap was narrow. The country’s Gini coefficient – a wealth inequality measure – has maintained a better balance than its neighbours and even parts of Western Europe. Throughout, Lukashenko has tried to cultivate an affectionate, paternalistic image as “Bat’ka” – the father of the nation. He’s regularly photographed taking part in “subbotnik” – the Soviet practice of undertaking unpaid volunteer work on the weekends – for instance, by helping out on a farm. He enjoys sport and fitness, and projected an image of a strong, healthy leader by playing hockey. “Lukashenko enjoys evening events,” said Latushka, who worked directly under the president during his time as a minister. “He gathered key officials, journalists, sports and cultural figures for closed parties on New Year’s, on the traditional Old New Year [January 14]. At first, there was an open part, and later a closed one, which could last until 6, even until 7 in the morning, with a concert programme in a Stalinist style when everyone sits at the table and watches the artists. Lukashenko can drink at such events – even a lot, and then he can even go dancing. This is a part of his life hidden from society.” But another aspect of Lukashenko’s leadership quickly became apparent early in his rule. “Fear. That is why officials sit with their heads down during meetings with him,” Latushka said. “Everyone is afraid to look him in the eye. This is a paternalistic system of power. As soon as he leaves, everyone’s heads will rise, everyone will start talking and acting differently. In public, Lukashenko is outwardly a very cruel person, capable of publicly humiliating anyone. He does not take into account other people’s points of view.” Within two years of stepping into office, Lukashenko engineered a constitutional referendum giving him control over parliament and the security apparatus. The opposition alleged widespread voting fraud, although it’s also possible a part of the citizenry, wary of the instability in neighbouring Russia, was indeed willing to grant Lukashenko those powers. Then in 2004, Lukashenko abolished presidential term limits through another such referendum, meaning he could stand for election again and again. Uladzimir Zhyhar, a former detective and representative of Belpol, a group of exiled ex-Belarusian police officers who defected to the opposition after the protests of 2020, accused law enforcement of being, first and foremost, henchmen for Lukashenko’s regime. “This is the system he has cultivated for 30 years,” Zhyhar told Al Jazeera. “After the anti-constitutional referendum of 1996, the police, courts, prosecutor’s office, investigative committee and, of course, special services, obey [Lukashenko]. There is torture, there are illegal arrests, there are interrogations … and the main department for fighting organised crime, which if it concerns politically motivated crimes, they are allowed to do everything. Absolutely everything, regardless of human rights or anything else.” Between 1999 and 2000, four of Lukashenko’s political opponents went missing (PDF): former Interior Minister Yury Zakharanka; lawmaker Viktar Hanchar and his friend, businessman Anatol Krasowski; and journalist Dzmitry Zavadski. An exiled member of an elite unit targeting gangs in 2019 admitted to taking part in three of their abductions and murders. Lukashenko hasappointed loyaliststo senior positions, both within the security forces and state-run industries. But it seems that he does not fully trust them. “Lukashenko absolutely hates people who can be in some position of authority, and so he is constantly engaged in the rotation of personnel,” Zhyhar explained. And while former security personnel may occupy deputy positions at enterprises, they are never – “as a rule” – appointed to top posts. “He is afraid that this former security operative, having certain knowledge, having a certain authority, will be able to form connections and pose a threat to him.” Early in his presidency, Lukashenko’s foreign policy echoed the old Soviet Union’s position during the Cold War. He railed against Western imperialism and travelled to Belgrade amid NATO bombing to support Serbia’s Slobodan Milosevic. He was also deeply invested inreintegration with Russiaand in 1997 signed a Union State agreement with then-President Boris Yeltsin. Under terms which were never fully implemented, Russia and Belarus would have re-united. “Lukashenko had a desire to unite with Russia into one state and to conquer it,” Karbalevich explained. “Then, in the 1990s, Boris Yeltsin was unpopular in Russia as a president. He was old and sick, and Lukashenko thought that he could defeat him at any democratic election. But then Putin came to power [in 1999], and Lukashenko lost interest in integration with Russia.” The initial relations between Lukashenko and Putin were “very, very tense”, added Vladzimir Astapenka, who served as a Belarusian diplomat to several Latin American countries in the 2010s. “They were like competitors, and Putin did a lot to move Lukashenko back to where he belongs.” Nevertheless, Lukashenko leveraged his position as one head of the nominal Union State to obtain concessions from Moscow. The Belarusian economy relied heavily on Russian subsidies of cheap oil, which was refined in Belarus and resold in Ukraine and the EU. Russia, meanwhile, imported vast quantities of Belarusian agricultural produce, such as milk and cheese. Relations remained cordial but distant throughout the 2010s, with Lukashenko quietly embracing a more Belarusian identity, even giving aspeechin Belarusian in 2014 instead of the customary Russian. Still, Yauheni Preiherman of the Minsk Dialogue Council on International Relations think tank, says Lukashenko has been successful at handling his personal relationship with Putin and Minsk’s with Moscow. “I sometimes call him the best Kremlinologist in the world, because whether we like him or not, his unique access to Putin himself and the rest of the Russian political elite makes him a very knowledgeable statesman in that regard,” he explained. At the same time, Lukashenko started reaching out to the West, for instance, in 2008 and 2015 ordering the release of political prisoners, after which the European Union (EU) in turn lifted some sanctions it had imposed over Belarus’s internal repression. At the onset of the war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Belarus positioned itself as a neutral mediator, with Lukashenko flip-flopping over the question of the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia early in the conflict. The story you usually find in the mainstream Western media is “Lukashenko, the last dictator of Europe, being only focused on ensuring his power inside the country. That makes him ideologically close to Putin, and that’s the end of the story,” Preiherman explained. But what gets overlooked is a more complex reality of his relationships with Russia and the West, he argues. “With Russia, he has had both more conflict and cooperation, whereas with the European Union and the West, he has had less of both. And this is easy to explain,” he said. “This is because the structure of Belarus is much closer to, and in many respects dependent on, Russia.” In 2019, the still-unresolved matter of the Union State manifested itself in a diplomatic crisis. Putin wanted to push ahead with reintegration, but Lukashenko warned any such action by Moscow would be interpreted as hostile, and the Kremlin fired back by cutting its oil subsidies. The next year everything changed. In the presidential elections of 2020, Lukashenko claimed victory with more than 80 percent of the vote, a ballot that was widely viewed by the opposition as rigged. Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets in the largest mass protests ever seen in Belarus. They were met bytruncheon-wielding riot squads. About 35,000 were arrested, and thousands were allegedlybeaten or torturedin custody. Up to as many as15protesters were killed during or in the aftermath of the unrest, and at least one individual was raped in custody. “For the first time, he lost,” Zhyhar said. “He lost informationally. He lost on the street, because thousands of people went out and lined up in a chain of solidarity. He lost, in fact, even at the elections themselves, because everyone saw the queues that were lined up to vote for [opposition candidate Sviatlana] Tsikhanouskaya. Everyone saw it.” “The authoritarian regime has become totalitarian,” Karbalevich said. “It is forbidden to criticise Lukashenko. It is forbidden to doubt the correctness of the state line. If a person is found [doing that] in social networks, he or she is detained for this. Lukashenko’s behaviour has changed. The political system has become more rigid. “Lukashenko is traumatised by the events of 2020. Now, he is cruelly enacting vengeance on the Belarusians who protested against him.” There are currently more than 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, at least 10 of whom are held in solitary confinement. They include Nobel Peace Prize winnerAles Bialiatski, chairman of the Viasna Human Rights Centre, andSergei Tikhanovsky, husband of Tsikhanouskaya who now leads the exiled opposition from Lithuania. “Lukashenko is well aware that not all the people against him have left the country, and he didn’t imprison everyone. And therefore, for four and a half years, we have been repressed,” Zhyhar said. “We have no independent media, we have no independent trade unions, we have no independent NGOs, we have no independent courts, we have no independent law enforcement agencies. And most importantly, Lukashenko is still afraid of the people. Therefore, he does not reduce repression, he only increases it.” The aftermath of the 2020 protests burned Lukashenko’s bridges with the West, as the United States, United Kingdom and EU imposed sanctions, while Putin supported him. “The sanctions, when they were initially adopted, were proclaimed as a means to force Lukashenko and his government to lessen domestic repression, free prisoners, and launch an inclusive internal discussion with his opponents,” said Preiherman. But on all those counts, the situation is much worse, he says. They have also created unintended consequences. “Lukashenko has had next to zero manoeuvring space in relations with Russia, [and] geopolitically, they have ensured that Russia is the only game in town,” he added. The protests presented Lukashenko with a dilemma: share power with the people, or with Putin, reflects Karbalevich. “He agreed to share power with Putin … Now people in the West think that Lukashenko is not an independent statesman, that Putin is the real master of Belarus and Lukashenko is only his puppet. I would not be so radical; Lukashenko is quite autonomous. But today, this union with Belarus and Russia is very close.” From February 2022, although he did not deploy troops in the conflict, Lukashenko allowed Russia to use Belarusian territory to launch the invasion of Ukraine. During the2023 revoltby the Russian mercenary Wagner Group, Lukashenko acted asmediatorbetween Putin and chief mutineer Yevgeny Prigozhin, allowing him to be portrayed as a peacemaker. “From being competitors they became … I wouldn’t say friends, but allies,” Astapenka, the former diplomat, said. “And Putin needs Lukashenko to control Belarus.” Last January, Lukashenko signed a law preventing opposition leaders abroad from standing in presidential elections and granting himself lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution, and lifelong support for himself and his family, should he retire. “To an extent, he became a hostage of the system that he himself created,” Karbalevich said. “He couldn’t leave power even if he wanted to. He’s afraid for his life, for his freedom, and therefore he will hold on to his power to the end.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "title": "Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire: Why is Israel still in southern Lebanon?",
        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "Israel had agreed to pull all troops out of Lebanese territory over the 60 days of the now-expired ceasefire. On the day Israeli forces weredue to withdrawunder a ceasefire deal, Lebanese health officials reported that the Israeli army killed at least 15 people in the south. At least83 people were also woundedas the Israeli army opened fire when people tried to return to their homes, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said in a statement on Sunday. The killings appear to be another violation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah and mark the latest in a series of violent attacks that have occurred since it began in November. The ceasefire brought a reduction in the number of daily attacks on Lebanon’s south, Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs. However, Israeli forces have remained in south Lebanon to conduct demolishing operations in border villages. Here’s a look at the situation in southern Lebanon on the last day of the ceasefire. Under the terms of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, Hezbollah agreed to pull back above the Litani River, which runs across south Lebanon, and Israel was supposed to pull all troops out of Lebanese territory over the 60-day period. Once the Israeli military was out,United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)were to enter, followed by the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). Furthermore, the LAF is supposed to ensure that they are the only Lebanese armed presence in south Lebanon. However, Israeli forces were still in the south on Sunday with both sides firing off blame as to why the terms of the ceasefire have not been followed. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said in recent days that the Israelis would hold on to certain points in Lebanon’s southeast. Israeli forces were required to withdraw from Lebanon as the ceasefire expired at 02:00 GMT on Sunday. A UN source told Al Jazeera on Friday that, while Israeli forces had withdrawn from large parts of the western and central areas of southern Lebanon, field data suggested they were preparing to retain points in the east. Netanyahu blamed Lebanon for the delay, sayingHezbollahhas not pulled back sufficiently from the border region. Lebanon denies the claim and has urged Israel to respect the deadline. Israel also justified this by saying the LAF has not been quick enough in deploying to the entirety of the south. The LAF denied those claims, saying they are fully prepared to deploy. UNIFIL, who has previously reported Israeli violations, has called on both sides to obey the terms of the ceasefire. The Israeli Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported on Friday that Israel was asking US President Donald Trump’s new administration to extend the deadline, claiming the Lebanese army has deployed too slowly to the south and allowed Hezbollah to regroup.    According to investigations by media organizations and think tanks, Israel has violated the ceasefire agreement hundreds of times. Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency monitored the region and noticed that Israel did not withdraw troops during the period but used the truce to reinforce military positions seized during previous combat operations. Sanad verified more than 30 videos and images of documented ground incursions and aerial attacks by Israel inside Lebanon during the ceasefire. There have been at least 660 incidents, according to Anadolu Agency, while the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a pro-Israel DC think tank, said Israel has committed at least 800 airspace violations since November 27. The Israeli military also entered new areas it had been unable to penetrate before the ceasefire agreement and demolished numerous civilian homes. Sanad found that 4.5 square km (1.74 square miles) of land, primarily along frontline villages, were subject to demolishing and bulldozing by Israeli forces. At least 90 people in Lebanon were killed by the Israeli military between the ceasefire and early December, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The country’s leaders have called for Israel to respect the terms of the agreement and for citizens to trust in the Lebanese Army. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, who is himself from southern Lebanon, sent a message to the residents of the area urging them to trust the army and to remain calm. “Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial unity are non-negotiable, and I am following this issue at the highest levels to ensure your rights and dignity,” he said in a statement. These sentiments were echoed by Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, who said he has full confidence in the LAF to protect Lebanon’s sovereignty and return residents to the south. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, also from southern Lebanon, called on the international community to pressure Israel to withdraw from occupied Lebanese territory. Hezbollah has not put out a public statement, but Hassan Fadlallah, a parliamentarian linked to the group, appeared on local television station Al-Jadeed to praise people pushing into their southern villages. Hezbollah has so far not presented a military response. Due to the cutting of its supply lines in Syria with the fall of the al-Assad regime, “Hezbollah’s military capabilities and regional influence have been diminished, leaving it more vulnerable to Israeli demands,” Imad Salamey, a political scientist at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, said. On January 25, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to his Lebanese counterpart, Joseph Aoun, and stressed the need for Israel to abide by the ceasefire agreement’s terms of withdrawal. The UN’s special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Passchaert, and UNIFIL’s head of mission, Aroldo Lazaro, released a joint statement saying the “timelines envisaged in the November Understanding have not been met” and urged displaced communities to “exercise caution”. During a visit a week earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasised the need for Israel’s military to withdraw. Thousands of Lebanese have returned to their homes in the south since November 27. In the hours after the ceasefire came into effect, tens of thousands of people headed south and visited their lands and homes. However, an Israeli military spokesman declared ano-go zoneacross many villages in southern Lebanon. He warned against the return to prominent villages such as Shebaa, al-Habbariyeh, Marjayoun, Arnoun, Yohmor, Qantara, Chaqra, Braachit, Yatar, and al-Mansouri due to them being declared “restricted zones”. On Saturday, the day before the ceasefire was to conclude, messages circulated amongst southerners who called for groups of people to gather near villages on Sunday morning and march towards them. A member of Lebanon’s civil defence forces stationed near the southern town of Meiss el-Jabal told Al Jazeera early Sunday that Israeli tanks were still blocking the road and people were not being allowed through. Israel, which claimed Hezbollah was behind the groups of residents assembling, opened fire on people moving towards their villages, though some villagers were able to push into their towns and were followed by the LAF.    The Lebanese Army has constructed checkpoints at many points near southern villages to try and manage the situation. The Army also entered certain villages, as did some villagers. Videos on social media circulated of residents standing face to face with Israeli tanks or soldiers in some areas, while in others, they were filmed fleeing as gunfire was heard in the background. Some villagers have been seen waving Hezbollah, or their ally Amal, flags and others carried images of the late Hezbollah Secretary-GeneralHassan Nasrallah. As for Israel, Salamey, the political scientist, says its decision not to leave represents its long-term strategy to reshape the political and military landscape of Lebanon so as to “neutralise any threats emanating from a post-Syria Hezbollah”. “This reflects a broader vision of ensuring Israel’s security and influence in the region while preventing Hezbollah from regaining its former strength,” he said.

        "title": "Spain plans 100% house tax on foreigners: Will it fix the housing crisis?",
        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "Socialist PM Sanchez announces several measures, including a 100 percent tax on foreigners, to tackle the housing crisis. Last week Spain’s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced several measures, including a 100 percent tax on the value of homes bought by foreigners, to tackle the country’s housing crisis. Sanchez aims to deter non-European Union residents from buying houses in the country. “Spain’s housing should be for Spanish people to live in, as well as for migrants who come here to work and build a life and contribute to the development and prosperity of our country,” Sanchez said, referring to people who use housing as an investment vehicle. Housing shortages and rising prices have provoked people to protest against tourists in several cities such as Barcelona and Seville, as foreign buyers and mass tourism are seen as contributing factors to the crisis. So how serious is the housing crisis and will the new measures tackle the issue that successive governments have failed to address? Sanchez has proposed 12 steps to tackle the country’s strained housing market, which saw some of Europe’s highest price increases last year at 8.3 percent. The 100 percent tax will affect overseas buyers, who bought 27,000 apartments in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, about 15 percent of all real estate properties were purchased by foreigners, according to the Association of Registrars. “They [overseas buyers] did so not to live, but to speculate, to make money with them, something that in the context of scarcity we cannot afford,” Sanchez said at the forum, “Housing, the Fifth Pillar of the Welfare State”, in Madrid on Monday. The Spanish leader also proposed higher taxes on holiday rentals to make sure apartments being rented out to tourists were taxed “like a business”. “It is not fair that those who own three, four, five apartments for short-term rental pay less tax than hotels,” Sanchez said. Other proposals include tax breaks and incentives for landlords to provide affordable housing, particularly to younger people and to cap rents in high-demand areas. Sanchez, who heads the left-wing coalition government led by his Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party, also plans to amend laws to speed up the construction of new houses and expand the availability of land for private construction. About 600,000 new homes are needed by the end of 2025 but some 90,000 homes are being built each year, according to the Bank of Spain. Sanchez stressed that housing was his government’s top priority but cautioned that there was no “magic wand” to solve the issue. The Spanish prime minister announced the transfer of two million square metres of land to a new, public company to construct “thousands and thousands” of affordable social housing units. Buildings under social housing are subsidised by the government and owned or managed by local or central government, or nonprofit organisations. Sanchez stated that social housing constitutes just 2.5 percent of Spain’s market, far below the space in other major EU countries, such as 14 percent in France and 34 percent in the Netherlands. Without outlining a detailed plan, Sanchez also said the government plans to combat fraud in holiday rentals, such as those on platforms like Airbnb. Fraud in Spain’s holiday rental market includes fake property listings and the unauthorised subletting of properties to tourists without the owners’ consent, and unlicensed rentals that fail to meet legal or safety standards. In December 2024, Spanish authorities launched an investigation into Airbnb for failing to delete thousands of misleading rental offers on its platform. Meanwhile, the golden visa, introduced in 2013, would be eliminated. This programme allowed wealthy non-EU investors to gain residency by purchasing real estate projects worth at least 500,000 euros (about $513,000). The tax will apply to individuals who are neither citizens nor residents of the European Union, and often use the properties as holiday or investment homes. United Kingdom buyers top the list of foreign property purchasers in Spain, making upabout 10 percentof all acquisitions by non-residents in the last quarter of 2023. Shortage of housing and high rentals mean that people have been priced out of the market, with the rate of homelessness rising by 24 percent since 2012 to 28,000 people, according toofficial figures. Spain’s new measures aim to help residents, especially those in cities and coastal areas such as the Balearic Islands, and the Canary Islands, where rents have surged due to high demand and limited supply. The exact timeline for implementing the tax on foreign buyers and other proposed measures has not been specified. The proposals require approval in Spain’s fragmented parliament, where Sanchez’s minority coalition may face a challenge in passing legislation. Housing in Spain has become particularly expensive in urban centres or tourist hotspots like Madrid, Barcelona, and cities on the Mediterranean coast. Rents in the country increased by 11 percent in 2024, according to real estate portal Idealista. A one-bedroom flat in Barcelona’s city centre costs an average of$1,313 per month, and $989 per month outside the city centre. Average rent in Barcelona has risen by53 percentover the past decade. However, Spanish cities are still cheaper than several Western European cities, where high rentals and housing prices have added to the cost of living crisis. In London, which has also been facing a housing crisis, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment was $2,738 a month in December 2024. Areport fromLondon’s City Hall showed that the city’s high rental costs were driven by its status as a global economic hub, attracting a large workforce and student population, which increases demand for housing. This demand is coupled with a significant decline in rental property supply since 2020, pushing rents to record levels. Sanchez pointed out that housing prices across Europe rose by 48 percent in the last 10 years, nearly double the increase in household income over the same period. “The West faces a decisive challenge: not to become a society divided into two classes, that of rich owners and poor tenants,” he said. “We are facing a serious problem, with enormous social and economic implications, which requires a decisive response from society as a whole, with public institutions at the forefront,” he said, according to comments published by the government. Spain is the world’s second most visited country with more than 94 million tourists in 2024. Tourism generated some $200bn in revenue, or 13 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Residents in Spain have complained about mass tourism, including gentrification, increased living costs and a spike in rowdy behaviour by party-seeking foreigners. However, tourism is not the only factor contributing to the housing crisis in Spain. Spain’s housing bust of 2008 and the subsequent financial crisis also worsened the problem. Between 2008 and 2014 Spain experienced a major financial crisis, which also included a prolonged real estate crash. “By 2015, house prices had fallen by a third from the 2008 peak, and there were essentially no new houses being built”, according to a working paper from the European Central Bank. The COVID-19 pandemic also added to the crisis as construction costs have risen substantially since then. High youth unemployment of 26 percent means that young people live with their parents for longer periods, slowing down new residential projects. Nearly two-thirds of Spanish young people aged between 18 and 34 live with their parents. Other factors include complex regulations that have slowed land development and a lack of bank financing and public budgets for real estate projects.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "title": "North Koreans are ‘disciplined’, armed with high-quality ammo, says Ukraine",
        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "Ukraine’s new enemies are learning on the battlefield but have fatal orders to follow to avoid capture, says Kyiv. Despite apushby the United States to end Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, Kyiv’s forces appear set for another hurdle almost three years into the conflict. According to South Korea, North Korea is preparing to send more soldiers to fight alongside Russian forces against Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine, which hasrecently capturedseveral North Korean soldiers, says overall, its new enemies are learning on the battlefield, becoming increasingly disciplined. “With about four months passing since North Korea’s deployment to the Russia-Ukraine war, it is presumed that follow-up measures and preparations for additional deployment are being accelerated due to the occurrence of many casualties and prisoners of war,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement they made public on Friday. Ukraine’s military intelligence (GUR) observed on January 2 that new North Korean troops were rotated into combat positions to replace losses. The GUR estimated North Korea has so far sent about 11,000 soldiers to fight in Russia’s region of Kursk, where Ukraine has staged a counter-invasion to distract Russian troops. That force was reported to have arrived in Kursk on November 4, and they entered the battle in earnest 10 days later. Since then, Ukraine says it has inflicted high casualties, but at a slowing rate, as North Koreans learn and adapt. In their first 40 days in the field, Ukraine said North Koreans suffered 3,000 casualties, or 75 a day, while in the following 20 days they suffered another 1,000 casualties, or 50 a day. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the toll. However, Western officials recently concurred with these Ukrainian figures. “I think there’s no reason why [North Korea] should not keep sending in battle casualty replacements and not to expand the North Korean force,” said Keir Giles, Russia and Eurasia expert at Chatham House, a UK-based think tank. “Russia – if all the estimates are to be believed – still badly needs the manpower, and North Korea still plainly values what it’s getting in exchange for this. So why would this force not be just the precursor to a much larger deployment?” he told Al Jazeera. Moscow has been cagey about the presence of North Korean soldiers, leaving Ukraine and its Western partners as the main sources of information about their alleged military conduct. In recent weeks, Kyiv has suggested there are grim orders at play – executions and suicides to hide identities and prevent being captured alive. “After the battles with our guys, the Russians are also trying to … literally burn the faces of the killed North Korean soldiers,” wrote Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on his Telegram channel last month – an apparent effort to conceal their ethnic identity. In December he wrote, “their own people are executing them.” Killed North Koreans have been found to be carrying papers falsely identifying them as Russian citizens, Ukraine’s army has said. Giles suggested Russian pride could be a factor. “[Russian leaders] don’t want this to become an issue within Russia itself because it undermines the myth that Russia does not need allies, that it is a superpower… that it is perfectly capable of winning wars on its own,” said Giles. Ukrainian troops and officials also claim that North Koreans have been instructed to kill themselves rather than surrender. Zelenskyy last week decorated the paratroopers of the 95th Air Assault Brigade who captured the first two North Korean POWs on January 9 and 11. Previously, wounded North Koreans are understood to have tried to lure their captors into a deathtrap, detonating a grenade as Ukrainians approached. Ukrainian paratroopers caught a third North Korean POW on Monday, after rebuffing an assault. In their opinion, he tried to kill himself. “When the [van that would transport him] drove up, there were concrete pillars under the road, and he accelerated and hit his head on the pillar. He hit it very hard and passed out,” the paratroopers said on January 21. According to Giles, “the fact that they only have three prisoners… is a good indication that measures are indeed being taken to make sure North Koreans don’t get caught.” One prisoner, a reconnaissance sniper, said he was told he was on a training mission, according to Kyiv. North Korea’s involvement in Ukrainecomes with benefits. While the isolated state has a history of sending mercenaries to wars in Africa and Vietnam for state revenue, it is receiving combat readiness at a level of action not since 1953, when the Korean War ended. Last October, expert Olena Guseinova, a lecturer at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, estimated North Korea could realistically send up to 20,000 soldiers to Ukraine based on economic interests, in a research paper for the Friedrich Naumann Foundation. She estimated the value of weapons North Korea sold to Russia at $5.5bn. North Koreanballisticmissiles have reportedly been falling on Ukraine since last September. “Kim Jong-un could potentially accumulate between $143m and $572m in additional annual revenue if he were to commit between 5,000 and 20,000 personnel to support Russia’s war effort,” Guseinova wrote. “The overall capacity of the DPRK’s military could hypothetically allow Kim Jong Un to deploy up to 100,000 troops to Ukraine. Realistically, however, the likelihood of such a commitment seems improbable,” she said, because of concerns about exposing North Koreans to outside influences. The Russian collaboration with North Korea started in the summer of 2023, when South Korean intelligence reported that Pyongyang began to supply Russia with nine million artillery shells. In addition to a defence pact with Russia, North Korea has been promised ballistic missile technology and assistance in launching satellites. Russia is believed to be paying for these weapons and services with free oil, sent into North Korea by train. The big shift in relations came on June 19 last year, when Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which, he said, included “mutual assistance in the event of aggression”.    In the early weeks of engagement, Ukrainian units posted aerial footage of North Koreans shooting aimlessly at the drones that killed them with grenades. Seoul’s National Intelligence Service attributed the high casualties to a “lack of understanding of modern warfare”. In recent days, however, Ukrainian units confessed that their North Korean adversaries were tough and disciplined fighters who spearheaded assaults for Russians. “They go first. If successful, the Russian troops go to consolidate and take up defence,” said Petro Gaidashchuk of Ukraine’s 80th Air Assault Brigade operating in Kursk. “The Koreans are more disciplined. They don’t panic so much if they come under fire. If there is one or more wounded in their assault group, they don’t run away,” he told a telethon on January 17. “They try to continue the assault, to pull the wounded away, despite the fact that there is shooting and explosions all around.” This has created friction among the Russians in whose units they were embedded, he said. After defeating a North Korean assault on January 18, Ukraine’s 8th Special Operations Regiment in Kursk said the enemy exfiltrated the battlefield “in a coordinated manner”. Gaidashchuk claimed Russia was lavishing equipment and training on North Koreans that it had denied to its own men. “The Russians are very dissatisfied with the fact that the North Koreans are better equipped, they are better fed and they are given more time for training, unlike the Russian contract soldiers,” Gaidashchuk said. Earlier this year, Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces posted excerpts from a notebook they claimed to have found on a North Korean military special forces officer, Gyong Hong Jong, who had been killed in action. “To be not a battalion that takes on obligations only in words, but a battalion that knows how to act and fight immediately after receiving an order, to prepare universal battalions that can perfectly perform any task even at the cost of death – this is the goal that every battalion in our armed forces must achieve, this is the spirit of this congress,” wrote Jong. Oleg Chaus, a Ukrainian sergeant with the 17th Heavy Mechanized Brigade in Kursk, said on Christmas Eve that whereas Russian assaults had been “chaotic” and “disorganised”, three units including North Koreans attacked in an organised manner and with air support on December 24. “All the servicemen of these three groups had very high-quality ammunition. Each of them had disposable grenade launchers, they had night vision devices, they had small assault backpacks with them,” he said. These reports contrast with descriptions of the foolhardy tasks given to Russian soldiers. In Toretsk, Ukrainian forces observed a new Russian tactic this month of using soldiers to run ammunition to a forward position, dump it to be picked up by an advancing assault group, and run back. They called such runners “camels”. Ukrainian soldiers commented that these fighters had a short life expectancy. “Sometimes a soldier goes on an assault without weapons or protective equipment,” Maksym Belousov, a spokesman for the 60th Mechanised Inhulets Brigade fighting near Lyman town, recently said. “His task is to be a ‘live target’ to detect our positions. He is followed by a trained fighter who can observe where the shooting is coming from and determine the location of our forces.”    One question for Ukraine’s allies is whether additional North Korean manpower necessitates their stepping in with boots on the ground as well. French President Emmanuel Macron firstraised that prospectalmost a year ago. Putin thenreactedwith a threat of nuclear attacks. On January 18, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Germany could send a peacekeeping force to secure a demilitarised zone if a ceasefire were agreed between Ukraine and Russia. “We’re the largest NATO partner in Europe. We’ll obviously have a role to play,” he told Suddeutsche Zeitung. “No one can pretend this is a conflict confined to one theatre,” said Giles. “It’s global. There’s a destabilising influence in multiple theatres. That strengthens the hand of [the Russian] coalition to challenge the West globally.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "title": "Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledges non-citizens deported from US to Mexico",
        "source": "https://www.aljazeera.com/",
        "content": "The Mexican president announced more than 4,000 people were sent to her country during Donald Trump’s first week back in office. Mexican PresidentClaudia Sheinbaumhas announced that her country has received an estimated 4,094 people deported from the United States in the week sinceDonald Trumptook office there. That number includes citizens from other countries, though Sheinbaum specified that the majority were Mexican. There has been no “substantial increase” in non-citizens arriving in the country, she added. Sheinbaum’s statement on Monday arrives at a delicate time for diplomacy in Latin America, as the region braces for changes under Trump’s second term as US president. Trump had campaigned on the promise of leading a “mass deportation” effort, and he has also pledged to push forward an aggressive “America First” foreign policy platform. Over the weekend, those efforts came to a headin a clashwith Colombian PresidentGustavo Petro, after the left-wing leader initially refused to accept US deportees sent on military flights. Colombia has long been a close ally of the US, particularly in its global “war on drugs”. Nevertheless, Trump responded to Petro’s refusal bythreateningto raise tariffs against Colombia, first by 25 percent and later by 50 percent. His administration also cancelled visa appointments at the US embassy in Bogota, Colombia’s capital. Petro indicated he would retaliate with tariffs of his own against the US. But by Sunday evening, he hadbacked down, allowing the deportation flights to resume. News reports in the US indicate that Mexico also refused access to a US military flight bearing deportees last week, though the circumstances that grounded the plane remain unclear. In the past, Sheinbaum and her administration have expressed disapproval over what they called “unilateral deportations” from the US. In December, Sheinbaum also emphasised that her priority would be to receive Mexicans, not citizens from other countries. “Our main function is to receive Mexicans,” she said. “We hope to have an agreement with the Trump administration in case deportations occur so that they also send people who come from other countries back to their countries of origin.” But on Monday, Sheinbaum emphasised that there was precedent for Mexico accepting non-citizen deportees from the US. She pointed to her predecessor and political mentor, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Under former US PresidentJoe Biden, Lopez Obrador agreed to accept up to30,000migrants and asylum seekers from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti per month. And in 2019, during Trump’s first term, Lopez Obrador committed to a policy known as “Remain in Mexico”, which required asylum seekers to stay in the country while making asylum claims at the US border. Critics had decried the policy as a violation of humanitarian law, which allows asylum seekers to cross borders to escape imminent persecution. They also pointed out that, under the “Remain in Mexico” policy, asylum seekers would be vulnerable to abuse from corrupt officials and cartels that operate along the Mexican side of the border. The policy was formally ended in 2021, under Biden. But Trump aims to reinstate “Remain in Mexico” during his second term. He was sworn in on January 20. While Sheinbaum has not yet agreed publicly to the proposal, she indicated on Monday that an agreement could be reached to keep non-citizens in Mexico. “In the case of people who are not Mexican, there is also prior coordination,” Sheinbaum said. “The United States has also had fluid communication with other governments, particularly in Central America.” She added that Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente was continuing conversations with the Trump administration “in particular on the issue of migration and the repatriation of Mexicans”. On Monday, Sheinbaum also praised the resolution of the US conflict with Colombia, which threatened to spark a regional trade war. “We think it is good that an agreement has finally been reached between the Colombian government and the United States government,” she said. “Dialogue and respect must prevail.” The Trump administration, meanwhile, has touted its clash with Colombia as a sign of the power of its foreign policy. “The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump’s terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in astatementon Sunday. “Today’s events made clear to the world that America is respected again.” Faced with last week’s news reports that Mexico had rejected a deportation flight as well, Leavitt responded with anotherstatementtouting Mexico’s cooperation. “Thanks to President Trump: Yesterday, Mexico accepted a record 4 deportation flights in 1 day!” Leavitt wrote. But the military-led deportation flights are likely to result in ongoing tensions around the region. In a statement on Saturday, officials in Brazil denounced the use of handcuffs on US deportation flights, calling it a sign of the “blatant disrespect” for human rights. Trump alsosaidthe retaliatory measures against Colombia “are just the beginning” of his plans to ensure his deportation programme continues. Mexico, meanwhile, has launched arepatriation programmecalled “Mexico Embraces You” to “welcome its fellow citizens with open arms” as deportations continue from the US.

        "content": "The attack in Tulkarem comes as Israeli raids on the nearby Jenin area of the occupied West Bank entered a seventh day. An Israeli air strike has killed two Hamas fighters in the city of Tulkarem, the Palestinian group said, underscoring Israel’s renewed focus on the occupied West Bank since the start of the ceasefire deal in Gaza. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said that the two men killed on Monday were members of its armed wing. The Israeli military said that it targeted a man who served as Hamas’s leader in Tulkarem, who it said was behind numerous attacks on Israelis, in addition to another Hamas member. Meanwhile, witnesses in Tulkarem told the Reuters news agency that an Israeli raid was under way in the city. That operation comes as Israeli raids on the nearby Jenin area continued into a seventh day. Backed by armoured vehicles and drones, Israeli forces launched a series of attacks on Jenin – a crowded township to the north of Tulkarem – onJanuary 21as part of Israel’s “Iron Wall” campaign. Since the start of the operation, at least 16 Palestinians have been killed in Jenin and the surrounding areas, according to Palestinian health authorities. Mohammad Jarrar, the mayor of Jenin, said on Sunday that some 15,000 people have been forced to flee the camp due to Israeli attacks. He added that according to initial estimates, the Israeli army has completely demolished between 30 and 40 homes in Jenin, and hundreds of others have been partially damaged. “The Israeli army is bulldozing and destroying streets and infrastructure, creating pathways for its vehicles through the rubble of demolished Palestinian homes,” Jarrar said. Last week, the Israeli military said in a statement that it carried out aerial attacks on “terror infrastructure sites” in Jenin, adding that “numerous explosives planted on the routes” were “dismantled”.    Late on Saturday, Israeli forces shot atwo-year-oldgirl during a raid on the village of Ash-Shuhada, just to the south of Jenin, Palestinian officials said. “They started to shoot at us through the windows without any warning,” Reuters quoted Ghada Asous, grandmother of Laila Muhammad al-Khatib, the infant girl, as saying. “All of a sudden, the special forces raided us and were shooting through the windows.” The Israeli military said troops on a “counterterrorism” operation had fired at a structure where suspected militants had barricaded themselves. It was reviewing reports that uninvolved civilians were injured, it said in a statement. The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed at least 838 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since the war on Gaza began on October 7, 2023.

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "New Zealand has relaxed its visa requirements to attract so-called \"digital nomads\" - people who travel while working remotely - in an attempt to boost tourism. Under the new rules, visitors can carry out remote working for a foreign employer while holidaying in the country for up to 90 days, after which they may have to pay resident's tax. \"The change will enable many visitors to extend their stays, which will lead to more money being spent in the country,\" Immigration Minister Erica Stanford said. New Zealand is currently in an economic recession and its tourism industry was badly affected by the closure of its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic. \"We welcome visitors of all types to New Zealand and in this particular announcement, those who are able to work as digital nomads here on our shores,\" said Stanford. The government said the changes applied to all visitor visas, including tourists and people visiting family, partners and guardians on longer-term visas. It added that only remote work based overseas was allowed, while visitors whose employment required them to be in the country still had to obtain appropriate visas. Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis said it was hoped the move would attract \"highly skilled people with roles that connect them to powerhouse firms and industries globally\". \"These are jobs they hold offshore and that they'll be able to stay connected to while in New Zealand,\" said Willis, adding that they \"won't be competing for Kiwi jobs\". Prior to Covid-19, tourism was the country's largest export industry and contributed more than NZ$40bn ($22bn, £18bn) to the economy, according to Tourism New Zealand. But this figure has dwindled in recent years in the wake of the pandemic. It is part of the wider economic hardship the country has been facing. Interest rate hikes fuelled by high inflation have seen economic growth in the country stagnate, leading to a rise in unemployment and the number of people seeking jobs abroad. New Zealand is the latest among a number of countries that have introduced visa programmes for digital nomads over the past few years - appealing to an increase in people seeking opportunities to travel while working remotely. The trend took off in the 2010s,mostly among young workerswho were looking to escape their daily routine. It was further bolstered by the Covid-19 pandemic, when worldwide lockdowns led to a shift in attitudes toward remote work. Countries offering digital nomad visas include Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Spain and Portugal. But the presence of digital nomads in some places has also sparked debate. In theSouth African city of Cape Town, detractors say the influx of remote workers has led to an increase in costs. The influx of visitors to countries such as Spain and Greece have also fuelled heated protests against over-tourism.

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "US First Lady Melania Trump's new official portrait has been released. Shot in the White House one day after her husband was sworn in as president, the black and white photo shows her wearing a dark business suit and white shirt as she rests her hands on a reflective table in the Yellow Oval Room. The Washington Monument, which towers over the nation's capital, is seen in the background. Mrs Trump - a former fashion model herself - is familiar with having her clothing choices and poses dissected by critics. The portrait was shot by Régine Mahaux, a photographer from Belgium who has been taking photos of the Trump family for more than 20 years. She also photographed Mrs Trump's official portrait in 2017, for Trump's first term in office.  \"I was really honoured to be chosen to shoot this official portrait for the second time,\" Ms Mahaux told the BBC on Monday. \"As an artist to work with such an inspiring woman is a great privilege. She is a perfectionist and is really involved in the creative process.\" Here is what experts said about the image. Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw is the Faculty Director for the Department of History of Art at the University of Pennsylvania. She curated the exhibition Every Eye is Upon Me: First Ladies of the United States at The National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC. Like the official portrait from her husband's first administration, also by the Trumps' favourite photographer Régine Mahaux, this picture of Melania Trump shows her wearing business attire and posed in front of a window. While the window in the first picture was recognisable to White House aficionados as it was located in the family quarters of the executive mansion, this one sited in the Yellow Oval Room facing the Ellipse features the Washington Monument placed just off to the left behind the First Lady. The rhyming of her body with this well-known obelisk, a symbol of the power invested in the first presidency, is striking. Her pose, with fingertips placed firmly on a remarkably reflective table, seems to communicate a readiness to \"get down to business\" and act upon the platform afforded to the unique role of hostess and advocate for the disempowered that Americans have historically expected first ladies to inhabit. Mrs Trump is extraordinarily comfortable in front of the camera, and this probably has a lot to do with her past as a model. But I think the relationship that she has developed with Ms Mahaux over the past two decades accounts for most of that ease. This photographer is a person that she trusts to make her appear confident, composed, and classy. To be good at their jobs, models must put themselves in the hands of the photographer who is directing the shoot and trusting that the resulting pictures will serve their purpose is critical to the equation. Mrs Trump trusts Ms Mahaux to accurately communicate her message, whatever that may be. The message of this picture is that the first lady has moved from the marginal space of the family quarters to the room just above the Oval Office. She appears ready to wield more of the power that she seemed rather reluctant to embrace in her first stay at the White House. And yet, she has positioned herself firmly behind that ultra shiny table, keeping a bit of a boundary between herself and the viewer. Staying a little mysterious, a little enigmatic, and a little inscrutable. Ellie Violet Bramley is a fashion writer who says the portrait carries a heaviness that appears at odds with the traditional role of a first lady. From the suit to the stance, the new portrait feels carefully orchestrated to exude a kind of power that feels at odds with the first lady's traditional role of softening a presidency in the public's eyes – and making it feel more human. Unlike the military-inflected ensembleworn by the first lady on inauguration day, this is a look that feels more aligned with corporate power. Ditto the stance: the positioning of the hands on the table seems intended to semaphore a kind of business-like intention – it has, after all, been reported that the first lady has been \"preparing intensively\" for the White House this time around. Much could be read into the details. Her shirt might be undone, in contrast to the severe, buttoned-up tailoring of last week, but her shoulders are sharp and accentuated. Her wide lapels could be reminiscent of the suiting of 1980s New York, a time and place when Melania's husband cut his teeth, but the silhouette is more sculpted and modern. During Trump's first presidency, Mrs Trump was largely quiet, beyond a slogan jacket that read \"I really don't care, do you?\" worn to a migrant child detention centre, and her Be Best platform, which had somewhat vague aims such as promoting healthy living. This time around, her appearances have hinted at a more intentional second run. The Washington Monument stands in the background, locating her very firmly in DC and not New York or Mar-a-Lago. And gone is the soft focus, the half-smile and the parted lips from her official portrait last time she was in the White House. Gone also is the colour: this time around the portrait is black and white. Much can be read into her eyes. The mere fact that they are so directly looking at camera – and the viewer in turn – in contrast to inauguration day when she opted for a boater hat that shrouded her eyes, feels noteworthy. But while eye contact can be about approachability, here it doesn't read that way. If previous first ladies such as Michele Obama and Jill Biden made accessibility their brand, in her official portrait, Melania remains enigmatic. The lawyers were part of former special counsel Jack Smith's team which brought two cases against the president. Trump said last week that he'll 'reach out' - but Washington faces a very different Kim this time around The move comes after President Donald Trump said he wants to acquire Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory.

        "title": "Survivors of Auschwitz deliver warning from history as memories die outWorld leaders rubbed shoulders with 56 survivors of Hitler's death camp as they marked 80 years since its liberation.5 hrs agoEurope",
        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "Their numbers are dwindling but the voices of the Auschwitz survivors remain powerful. \"We were stripped of all humanity,\" said Leon Weintraub, 99, the oldest of four who spoke beside the notorious Death Gate at the Birkenau extermination camp. Marking 80 years since its liberation, world leaders and European royalty rubbed shoulders on Monday with 56 survivors of Hitler's genocide of European Jews. \"We were victims in a moral vacuum,\" said Tova Friedman, who described witnessing the horrors of Nazi persecution as a five-and-a-half-year-old girl clinging to her mother's hand. She described watching from her hiding place at a labour camp \"as all my little friends were rounded up and driven to their deaths, while the heartbreaking cries of their parents fell on deaf ears\". The warnings from history were clear: the survivors more than anyone understood the risks of intolerance, and antisemitism was the canary in the coal mine. Under an enormous, white tent that covered the death camp entrance, Leon Weintraub appealed particularly to young people to be \"sensitive to all expressions of intolerance and resentment to people who are different\". The Nazis murdered 1.1 million people at Auschwitz-Birkenau between 1941 and 1945. Almost a million were Jews, 70,000 were Polish prisoners, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war and and an unknown number of gay men. This was one of six death camps the Nazis built in occupied Poland in 1942, and it was by far the biggest. Another survivor to speak was Janina Iwanska, 94, a Catholic arrested as a child during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. She remembered how so-called Nazi \"Angel of Death\" Josef Mengele sent all the remaining Roma in the camp to their deaths at Birkenau, because he no longer needed them for his lethal medical experiments. Marian Turski, 98, said only a few had survived the death camp and now they were but a handful. His thoughts turned to the millions of victims \"who will never tell us what they experienced or they felt, just because they were consumed by that mass destruction\". The director of the Auschwitz museum, Piotr Cywinski, issued a plea to protect the memory of what had happened, as the survivors died out. \"Memory hurts, memory helps, memory guides… without memory you have no history, no experience, no point of reference,\" he said, as survivors listened on, many of them wearing blue-and-white striped scarves to symbolise prisoners' clothing. Memory was the watchword of this day, marked around the world as International Holocaust Memorial Day. Polish President Andrzej Duda pledged that Poland could be entrusted to preserve the memory of the six death camps on its territory, at Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Majdanek and Chelmno. \"We are the guardians of memory,\" said Duda, after laying a wreath at the wall where thousands of prisoners were executed at Auschwitz 1, the concentration camp 3km (1.85 miles) from Birkenau. Far away from the entrance to a Nazi death camp, at the United Nations in New York, Secretary General António Guterres said \"remembrance is not only a moral act, it's a call to action\", and warned Holocaust denial was spreading and hatred was being stirred up across the globe. He cited Italian survivor Primo Levi who wrote his memories of the camps for posterity but was unable to endure the scars of what he had witnessed. In the words of fellow survivor Elie Wiesel, Levi \"died at Auschwitz 40 years later\". Among those who travelled to southern Poland for Monday's commemoration of the day the Red Army liberated Auschwitz were King Charles, King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain, and Denmark's King Frederik and Queen Mary. Charles III became the first serving British monarch to visit Auschwitz, and could be seen wiping away tears as he listened to the accounts of the four survivors. As he toured the camp he laid a wreath in memory of the victims. Sources close to the King said it was a profound visit for him, and one aide described it as a \"deeply personal pilgrimage\". Hours earlier, he said remembering the \"evils of the past\" remained a \"vital task\". Visiting the Jewish Community Centre in Krakow, which he opened 17 years ago, the King said the Krakow Jewish community had been \"reborn\" from the ashes of the Holocaust, and that building a kinder and more compassionate world for future generations was the \"sacred task of us all\". Polish-born British survivor Mala Tribich, 94, was liberated from the concentration camp at Bergen Belsen, and attended Monday's event at Auschwitz. \"We've seen the consequences of the camps and the beatings and hate,\" she told the BBC. \"And what [children] are taught under the circumstances of a despot can be so damaging, not only to them but to everything around. So we really must guard against it.\" Lord Pickles, the UK's special envoy for post-Holocaust issues and chair of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, warned \"distortion\" was threatening the legacy and historical truth of the Holocaust. Having listened to the survivors inside the tent at Birkenau, he told the BBC \"we saw a transfer from memory into history\", as the likelihood of survivors delivering further speeches dwindles. \"That's very daunting and I don't believe we're in a post-Holocaust world,\" he added. A survey across eight countries published last week suggested a widespread belief that another Holocaust could happen again. Concern was particularly high in the US and UK, according to the survey of 1,000 people in each country for Claims Conference. Additional reporting by Laura Gozzi in London. The Israeli ambassador says President Michael D Higgins had \"predictably admonished\" the state of Israel Lady Milena Grenfell-Baines is one of the last survivors of a group of 140 children who fled to Llanwrtyd Wells.

        "content": "During the 19th Century, the activity of \"retro-walking\" was little more than an eccentric hobby, but today research is revealing it can have real benefits for your health and brain. On an apparent wager to win $20,000 (about £4,250 at the time), a 50-year-old cigar-shop owner calledPatrick Harmonembarked on a curious challenge in the summer of 1915 – he planned to walk backwards from San Francisco to New York City. With the aid of a friend and a small car mirror attached to his chest to help him see where he was going, Harmon made the 3,900 miles (6,300km) journey in 290 days, apparently walking every step backwards. Harmon claimed the journey made his ankles so strong that \"it would take a sledge hammer blow to sprain them\". Perhaps he was onto something. According to research, walking backwards can have surprising benefits for both your physical health and your brain, as Michael Mosley recently explored in a recent episode of the BBC podcast and Radio 4 showJust One Thing. Retro-walking, as walking backwards is known in academic circles, has a rich history. There arereports dating back to the early 19th Centuryof people walking hundreds, and sometimes thousands of miles, in reverse. Many were the result of impulsive bets and others were simply attempts to claim the bragging rights to a bizarre new record. But due to the difference in biomechanics, backwards walking can actually bring some physical benefits. It is often used in physiotherapy torelieve backpain,knee problemsandarthritis. Some studies even suggest that backwards walking can positively affect cognitive abilities such as memory, reaction time and problem-solving skills. The practice of walking backwards for health purposes is thought to haveoriginated in ancient China, but it has received attention from researchers more recently in the US and Europe as a way ofimproving sports performanceand to build muscle strength. Just one thing If time is tight, what's the one thing you should be doing to improve your health and wellbeing?Listen to Michael Mosleyas he reveals surprisingly simple tips that are scientifically proven to change your life. Janet Dufek, an expert in biomechanics at the University of Nevada in the US, has been researching backwards locomotion for more than 20 years. She and her colleagues have found walking backwards for just 10-15 minutes per day over a four-week periodincreased the hamstring flexibilityof 10 heathy female students. Backwards walking can alsostrengthen the muscles in the backresponsible for spine stability and flexibility. And in another study led by Dufek, a cohort of five athletes self-reported areduction in lower back painafter periods of backwards walking. \"Our research has shown that, indirectly, backward walking has some benefits relative to lower back pain simply because you're stretching the hamstrings,\" says Dufek. \"Often one of the pieces that's tied to lower back pain is tight hamstrings.\" Backwards walking and backwards running drills are alreadyused in some sports training, particularly team and racquet sports which require the agility to quickly move forwards, backwards and laterally. As it reduces the stress placed on the knee joints while building strength, retro-running is also useful for helping toprotect athletes from injury. As well as athletes, retro-walking has been found tobenefit the elderly,young, obese individuals, sufferers ofosteoarthritis, andpost-stroke patientswith walking impairments. Backwards walking has also been found toburn more caloriesthan walking forwards. But why is it so beneficial? \"The biomechanics of walking backwards is very different than forward walking,\" Dufek told Mosley. \"In backward walking, there is a reduced range of motion at the knee that can have some benefits for individuals who may be rehabilitating from knee surgery, for example.\" Onerecent studyfound that the range of motion at both the hip and knee joints is greatly reduced during backwards walking. Whilst the forwards gait begins with heel contact, the backwards gait begins with toe contact and the heel sometimes never lowers to the ground. As a result, less impact is felt at the knee joint and it uses different muscles compared to normal walking. It is actually the ankle joint whichabsorbs the most shockduring backwards walking. Muscles activated inplantar flexion movement (used when pointing or standing on your toes) play a greater role in backwards walking to decelerate the ankle and absorb shock. So it seems there is more than a grain of truth in Harmon's claim to superior ankle strength, even if it waslikely he took a few train journeysalong the way. But the benefits don't end with stronger ankles. Researchers have also founddifferences in the location of neural activitywhen stepping backwards compared to stepping forwards. Theprefrontal cortex, responsible for cognitive skills such as decision making and problem solving, is especially active when stepping backwards. One Dutch study tested 38 participants' ability to solve aStroop test– which uses conflicting stimuli such as the word \"blue\" in red letters to interfere with how quickly people respond to a prompt – whilst stepping backwards, forwards or sideways. It found that participants stepping backwards had thefastest reaction times, perhaps because their brains were already used to performing an incongruous task. Another study strongly concluded that different forms of backwards locomotion, including backwards walking, watching a video of a backwards train journey, and even just imagining moving backwards, improved participants'ability to recall information. You might also like: Withlarger studies of healthy populationsas well as those who are unwell starting to add to the mix of research on retro-walking, the evidence for its benefits and limitations are becoming clearer. \"I think that technology is driving a lot of biomechanics research, presently,\" says Dufek, \"In the day when I was trained if you did a study that had 10 participants, that was huge. And now, I mean even me and my groups are doing work with big data because it's much easier to collect a lot of information, and get some very sound statistical outcomes.\" But there's also an element of risk when it comes to retro-walking. Care needs to be taken to avoid unseen obstacles and there are cases wherewalking backwards during physiotherapy has resulted in falls and serious injuries. There are also other ways of achieving the same results. Scientists in China, for example, found that tai chi and swimming aremore effectiverehabilitation activities for athletes with lower back pain than backwards walking, jogging, or no exercise at all. But as Dufek says, there is another reason to give retro-walking a try – the novelty. \"I mean there are other ways you can stretch your hamstrings, you can just do hamstring stretches\" says Dufek, \"But, you may as well do something fun, right?\" -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "An AI-powered chatbot by the Chinese company DeepSeek has quickly become the most downloaded free app on Apple's store, following its January release in the US. The app's sudden popularity, as well as DeepSeek's reportedly low costs compared to those of US-based AI companies, have thrown financial markets into a spin. Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has hailed DeepSeek as \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs\" in AI. The company says its latest AI models are on par with industry-leading models in the US - like ChatGPT - at a fraction of the cost. Researchers behind the app have said it only took $6m (£4.8m) to build it, much less than the billions spent by AI companies in the US. DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence company founded in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China. The company was launched in July 2023, but its popular AI assistant app was not released in the US until 10 January, according toSensor Tower. Liang Wenfeng partly funded DeepSeek using money from a hedge fund that he also launched. The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China. Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import. Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang. The company's AI app is available for download in Apple's App Store and online at its website. The service, which is free, has quickly become the top downloaded app on Apple's store, although there have been some reports of people having trouble signing up. It has also become the top-rated free application in the US on Apple's app store. DeepSeek has become popular for its powerful AI assistant which operates similarly to ChatGPT. According to its description on the App Store, it is designed \"to answer your questions and enhance your life efficiently\". Comments left by users rating the app say \"it gives the writing more personality\". But the chatbot skirts at least one politically sensitive question. When the BBC asked the app what happened at Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, DeepSeek replied: \"I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.\" DeepSeek was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its US rivals - hundreds of millions of dollars less - raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance. The company's possibly lower costs roiled financial markets on 27 January, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall more than 3% in a broad sell-off that included chip makers and data centres around the world. Nvidia, a US-based company that makes the powerful chips that run AI, appears to have been hit the worst. It lost nearly $600bn in market value on Monday - the largest one-day drop for any company in US history - as its stock price plunged 17% over the course of the day. Nvidia had been the most valuable company in the world, when measured by market capitalization, but fell to third place after Apple and Microsoft on Monday when its market value shrank to $2.9tn from $3.5tn, Forbes reported. DeepSeek uses less advanced semiconductor chips than the ones created by Nvidia. Their success undercuts the belief that bigger budgets and top-tier chips are the only ways of advancing AI, a prospect which has created massive uncertainty about the need and future of high-performance chip.

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "The cameras struggled to get a steady shot as Donald Trump took his first historic steps into enemy territory with Kim Jong Un. It was 2019 and the then-45th president of the United States patted the arm of the North Korean leader, then on cue, Kim led him across the threshold that separates his country from South Korea - two countries officially still at war. Behind them, within the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), it was chaos as TV crews jostled to get a clear view through a line of North Korean bodyguards who seemed surprised by the onslaught of US media. At one point, a reporter asked for help and the White House press secretary had to pull them from behind a line of security to the Trump-Kim photo call. This meeting had been hastily organised – and it showed. \"I never expected to meet you at this place,\" said Kim to Trump. The US president had organised the last-minute rendezvous on Twitter, as it was then known, just 30 hours earlier when he suggested meeting Chairman Kim at the DMZ \"just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!\" The impromptu invitation created a third and last incredible TV moment between a showman president anda once reclusive dictator. Now, it appears there could be more. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview broadcast last Thursday that he will once again \"reach out\" to Kim. \"I got along with him,\" Trump added. \"He is not a religious zealot. He happens to be a smart guy.\" The BBC understands that there has been very little contact between the US and North Korea in the last four years during the Biden administration. Washington has sent messages but there has been no reply from Pyongyang. The last meeting between the two nations, when Trump was last in office, did not advance a longed-for deal to get North Korea to give up its prized possession – its nuclear weapons. Since then, Kim has advanced his missile programme and claims to have successfully tested a hypersonic missile, despite being subject to strict international sanctions. It's a far cry from when Trump used to boast that the two \"fell in love\". The question is, can the relationship be rekindled - or could it be a very different picture this time around? Washington will, after all, be dealing with a very different Kim now. In the last four years his alliances and fortunes have shifted - and his relationship with another world leader appears to have strengthened too. So, could it mean that this has all changed his dynamic with Trump for good? \"It's definitely a possibility,\" says Jenny Town, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center and the director of Stimson's Korea Program. \"You can tell by Donald Trump's decision to appoint a special envoy for sensitive issues that include North Korea, I think it gives you an indication of kind of where his thinking is on that right now.\" Trump has brought back some of those who helped set up his summits with Kim, including the former ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell who has been picked as his presidential envoy for special missions on \"some of the hottest spots\" around the world, including North Korea. But there have been changes in the intervening years. \"North Korea will spend the first year trying to prove to Trump that Kim Jong Un isn't who he was in 2017 - that he's militarily stronger, that he's politically stronger, and that, if they ever get back to that point, it's going to be a very different negotiation,\" argues Ms Town. Kim is also embracing a new friend – Russia's President Vladimir Putin. He has helped North Korea with food and fuel in return for weapons and soldiers for his war effort in Ukraine. Pyongyang is no longer as desperate for relief from US sanctions. Rachel Minyoung Lee, who worked as a senior North Korean media analyst for the U.S. government told the BBC that Pyongyang has \"primed\" its people by informing them in state media about Donald Trump's return. But she believes the \"bar for entering talks will now be higher than before.\" \"Two things will have to happen,\" she added. \"North Korea is desperate enough to return to the negotiating table, for example due to a crumbling economy or a significant cooling off in its relations with Russia; or the United States makes an offer to North Korea that is drastically different from what it did in the past.\" Trump sparked speculation that he is willing to restart talks with Kim during a recent signing ceremony in the Oval Office, when he said: \"I was very friendly with him. He liked me. I liked him. We got along very well.\" But the Trump administration should be realistic this time around, says Sydney Seiler who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council. \"The arms control thing is a red herring. There is no arms control to be had with North Korea. We've tried arms control,\" he said. \"Maybe North Korea will sit and talk, and maybe they'll refrain from long range missile launches, and they'll not conduct a seventh nuclear test, and the issue will be largely manageable. That's the best-case scenario. \"The worst-case scenario is that even if you talk, they'll continue to launch, they'll continue to test. So, Donald Trump would have to consider: what is the value of engaging North Korea?\" Especially because they will both carry significant scars from their last meeting. I watched the Winter Olympics in 2018 in South Korea's chilly Pyeongchang with an unexpected guest – sitting below my balcony seat was Kim's sister. It was the first time a member of the Kim family had visited the South since the end of the Korean War, a visit that elicited a loud scream of surprise from my South Korean producer. Sitting near her on the stands was the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. From what I observed, they could barely look at each other. But still it was an extraordinary step for diplomacy, and one that would have been unimaginable a few months ago. When Trump took office in January 2017, he had been warned about North Korea. The last three presidents had tried and failed to pressure the state to give up its nuclear weapons after several rounds of talks and sanctions. After Donald Trump's Inauguration, Kim fired a missile almost every month. The president took to Twitter to air his wrath threatening to rain down 'fire and fury' on North Korea. He dubbed Kim as \"Little Rocket Man\", in return Pyongyang nicknamed Trump \"Dotard\". Then came threats about pressing nuclear buttons, first from Pyongyang, then Washington. Trump wrote on Twitter that he too had a nuclear button, \"but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\" After a year of acrimonious exchanges and brinkmanship that had some in Seoul wondering if they should plan for war – everything changed. The liberal South Korean president, Moon Jae-in had been hoping for an icebreaker with Pyongyang. He was born in a refugee camp after his parents fled the war in the North. He had even visited his aunt there in a rare family exchange between the two countries. When Pyongyang opened the door a crack and asked - could North Korea take part in the Winter Olympics? Seoul, led by Moon, kicked it wide open. Trump arrived in Singapore for his summit with Kim promising to make history. The North Korean leader took a night-time stroll through glitzy downtown and took selfies as if he was on a night out with the boys. He'd barely travelled outside his own borders - but he was proving that he too knew how to put on a show. But even after his much-photographed handshake with Trump, this now very personal form of diplomacy produced very little in the way of concrete promises for North Korea to disarm. They both signed a vaguely worded statement to work towards denuclearisation and promised to meet again. The stakes were higher for the second Trump and Kim show in Vietnam. Photo-ops would not be enough from a US president who bragged about his deal-making prowess. We waited for hours in the humid streets of Hanoi outside the gates of the French colonial Metropole Hotel, where we were initially told the pair were having lunch. But it turned out, lunch had been cancelled. The BBC has spoken to three people who took part in the summit to piece together what went wrong. It seems both leaders may have overestimated the hand they had to play. Trump offered to lift U.S. sanctions on North Korea if Kim gave up all his nuclear weapons, nuclear material and nuclear facilities. The president had reportedly been warned that the North had turned this deal down in the past, but he felt his personal rapport with the North Korean leader would help him succeed. It did not. Kim gambled on Trump accepting a more modest deal. He too thought their personal relationship would allow him to prevail. He offered to dismantle his aging Yongbyon nuclear complex for an end to all US sanctions since 2016. \"Singapore had given Kim Jong Un some prestige and the belief that finally, the United States is coming to its senses and talking to me on my own terms,\" says Mr Seiler. \"He came to the table expecting, because he had been coached, we know, quietly, by the South Koreans who were saying, Donald Trump is politically desperate, he is no longer listening to John Bolton, he is willing to agree to a deal that puts a small part of your nuclear program on the table in return for sanctions relief.\" But the president had also been briefed. He had been told that the North could still produce uranium at an enrichment centre near Pyongyang. The U.S. said it had been monitoring other sites the North thought they'd kept secret for some time. \"I think that they were surprised that we knew,\" Trump later said. The deal Kim offered was not nothing, but it was not good enough for the US president. \"Kim Jong Un comes to the table and he had no plan B,\" says Mr Seiler. \"So, when Donald Trump says we've got to do more than this, Kim Jong Un remains totally inflexible.\" The BBC understands from its sources that Kim tried to save the deal. He sent an aide to remind Washington what was on the table and that they would dismantle all of the Yongbyon plant. But Trump was already heading to the airport. \"The story of Hanoi needs to be gotten right,\" says Mr Seiler. \"The common theme is Donald Trump walked out of the room. It was an all or nothing deal, and when Kim Jong Un wasn't willing to put it all on the table, Donald Trump walked. That's a very simplistic pedestrian assessment of what transpired at Hanoi.\" As Trump flew back to Washington, the North Koreans took the unprecedented step of holding a press conference. Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters that this opportunity may never come again. It hasn't as yet  - and Kim may think twice about taking part in talks again. \"There definitely was an opportunity there,\" says Jenny Town. \"Kim Jong Un had actually built-up domestic expectation in North Korea that they were on the verge of a breakthrough, and that it was going to bring benefits.\" \"If we could have taken advantage of that moment, we could have been on a very different track. Were you going to get denuclearisation easily? Absolutely not. But would we be in a very different place in terms of tensions on the Korean Peninsula and how far North Korea has gone in its nuclear development, maybe. We'll never know, obviously, but there was definitely a will there that doesn't exist now.\" Donald Trump's unorthodox diplomacy reduced tensions for a while, but it did not stop the expansion of Pyongyang's weapons programme. His 20 steps into North Korean territory may also have legitimised a regime with one of the worst human rights records on the planet. But after three meetings and there appeared to be a connection between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that offered some hope that one day there would be peace on the Korean Peninsula.

        "title": "Israel says eight hostages due to be freed in first phase are dead10 hrs ago",
        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "Israel says eight of the remaining 26 hostages due to be released by Hamas during the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal are dead. Government spokesman David Mencer told reporters that Israel had received a list from the Palestinian armed group overnight that provided information on the status of the hostages. \"The list from Hamas matches Israel's intelligence, so I can share with you that... eight have been killed by Hamas,\" he said, without naming them. \"The families have been informed of the situation of their relatives.\" Seven women have already been freed alive in exchange for more than 290 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails since the ceasefire began on 19 January. On Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced Hamas had agreed to release female civilian Arbel Yehud, female soldier Agam Berger and one other hostage on Thursday. Three additional hostages would be released by the group on Saturday, he said. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 47,310 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says 87 of the hostages remain in captivity, 34 of whom are presumed dead. In addition, there are three Israelis who were abducted before the war, one of whom is dead. One of the hostages who Israel says should be released in the first phase is Or Levy, 34, who was attending the Nova music festival with his wife Eynav on 7 October 2023. The couple, whose son Almog is now three years old, fled to a roadside bomb shelter after Hamas gunmen attacked. Eynav was killed inside the shelter while Or was kidnapped and taken back to Gaza. Over the weekend in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, Or's brother Michael told the BBC that waiting to hear about the statuses of the remaining 26 hostages was like being plunged into \"a reality the devil himself invented and part of an evil reality show that Hamas is enjoying\". He also said he had received no indication about when Or would be freed and there would be what he described as \"an end date to this nightmare\". Michael also said he feared that Hamas could yet delay his brother's release. \"We cannot just be calm and hope for the best. We have to keep going. And until he's here, I won't believe it actually happened.\" On Saturday, following the release of four female Israeli soldiers in the second exchange of the ceasefire, the Israeli military's spokesman said it was \"extremely concerned\" about the welfare of three hostages – Shiri Bibas, 33, and her two young sons, Kfir, two, and Ariel, five. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that they had been killed in an Israeli air strike. However, the Israeli military has not confirmed their deaths and the Israeli government has insisted they are among the 33 hostages handed over in the first phase. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released in exchange for more prisoners, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and \"the restoration of sustainable calm\" - are due to start on 4 February. The third and final stage will involve the reconstruction of Gaza, which could take years, and the return of any remaining hostages' bodies. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum is demanding that the Israeli government implement all three phases and ensure the return of every hostage. \"We are not whole without them all. Our nation needs everyone at home, together. Until the last hostage,\" it said. Meanwhile, the deputy chief of the Israeli military's medical corps said some of seven newly released hostages had spent \"the entire time in tunnels underground\" in recent months. \"Some of them were alone through the entire time they were there,\" Col Dr Avi Banov said, according to Reuters news agency. \"Those who said they were together were in better shape.\" The hostages had said their treatment improved in the days leading up to their release, when they were allowed to shower, change their clothes and received better food, he added. Lebanon and the US said the agreement will remain in place until 18 February. It comes as the deadline passes for Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters to withdraw from southern Lebanon.

        "content": "Once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\", Albania is turning to its millennia-old sites and rich cultural heritage to recast its image. After a period of turmoil, places often talk about looking towards the future. However, 40 years after the death ofcommunist dictator Enver Hoxha, Albania is, in many ways, looking to its distant past. A period of extreme isolationism from the 1940s to 1991 led the Balkan nation to close its religious institutions, neglect many of its historical sites and to become known as \"the North Korea of Europe\". But today, Albania is working hard to reclaim its cultural heritage by preserving its natural landscape and embracing its ancient roots. The more-than-2,500-year-old ruins of the city ofButrintis one such example. Dating back to roughly 800BC, the site has long stood in the centre of the Western world, surviving conflicts, absorbing different cultures and leaving multiple layers of history to explore. It was likely a Greek city-state before the Romans expanded it into a bustling town complete with a bathhouse. Later, the Byzantines and Ottomans both left their respective marks on it. Butrint's history tells the story of the Mediterranean's shifting politics and its many cultures and religions – all of which have shaped modern-day Albania. \"In 1992, [Butrint] was the first place in Albania declared aUnesco World Heritage site,\" explained BBC Travel Show host Qasa Alom in a recent episode. \"[It preserves] some of the rich cultural history that lies beyond the shadow cast by the events of the last century.\" Today, the city's sprawling ruins are part of the largerButrint National Park, which includes 93-sq-km of forested coastal landscape. In addition to the historic site, the park is also home to1,200 different plant and animal species. Visitors can explore the ruins of a Hellenistic-era theatre, admire early Christian monuments and then hike the wooded hills or cruise the nearby Lake Butrint. The preservation of both the ruins and the surrounding parkland are the result of a concerted effort from organisations like theButrint Foundationand theWorld Monuments Fund. Donations from both groups have helped restore Butrint and protect the surrounding landscape, while also providing training in historic preservation that created much needed jobs to the local community. \"It has been a struggle the last 30 years to protect the beauty and the history of Butrint, originally [because of] the neglect after the fall of communism… but also with the developers trying to build around the site,\" Ani Tare, Director of the Butrint National Park told the BBC. Butrint isn't the only part of Albania that has experienced a restoration. In the nation's capital, Tirana, located 278km (173 miles) to the north, many Hoxha-era monuments have been torn down to make way for new community spaces.Skanderbeg Square, for example, once home to several monuments dedicated to communism and Hoxha's power, is now the largest pedestrian square in the Balkans. Similarly the toweringPyramid of Tiranahas been transformed from a museum dedicated to Hoxha into a park and sculpture garden with sweeping views of the city.

At Butrint, for example, programming like theirannual drama festival, put on inside of the site's ancient stone theatre, has helped bring back a sense of pride and history among the local community. \"In the beginning [visitors to the festival were] noisy, they didn't understand what was going on and they used to steal the cushions,\" Tare explained. \"In five years, the local people here would come beautifully dressed, nobody makes noise, everyone respected the theatre, nobody stole cushions. Why? Because the culture [of this place] made them aware and gave them a sense of pride.\" -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "Some communities have developed techniques to help them carry heavier loads. Here's what we can learn from them. The rural farm workers of Vietnam could be seen as almost superhuman. Every day, they shoulder impressive loads strung to a pole before carrying them for up to several miles at a time by foot. The awkward, bulky packages of produce, tools or other materials can oftenweigh more than their own bodyweight, yet they seem to take the burden in their stride. It is a feat most of us would struggle to achieve. Lifting something equivalent to our own bodyweight is hard enough, but then walking long distances with it would defeat all but the hardiest of strongmen or women. The Vietnamese farm workers, however, have a secret weapon –their long springy bamboo poles. The workers adjust their gait so that the load on either end of the poles oscillates in time with their strides. This reduces the amount of effort required to lift the weightwith each step by around 18%, according to one study by researchers who studied the farm workers' carrying abilities. But even with this springy assistance, there can be little doubt that these farm workers are also just supremely strong after years of carrying heavy loads. Many of us with jobs that don't involve so much fetching and carrying could also benefit from getting stronger, however. So, what does it take to build this kind of strength? There can be little doubt that humans have a preoccupation with strength. The sport of weightlifting has captivated audiences for more than4,000 yearsand can be traced back to ancient Egypt, Greece and China. Writings, statues and artefacts such as halteres (large throwing stones) from ancient Greece show that competitions involving resistance lifting and strength were popular as early as 557BC. Of course, the sport has come a long way, becoming apermanent fixturein the Olympics at the 1920 Antwerp games. At the extreme end we could look at Georgian weightlifter Lasha Talakhadze. At the World Weightlifting Championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 2021 heachieved three world records, which he still holds today. During the competition he lifted267kg (584lbs) in the clean and jerk– more than twice his own bodyweight. For most of us, the idea of lifting that much is incomprehensible. But increasing your strength by lifting weights can bring benefits. Strength training among older adults, for example, has been shown toimprove their healthand mobility. It can help tobuild athletic performanceand has been linked tolower levels of mortalityfrom conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Some studies have also suggested strength training could bebeneficial for mental health too. Perhaps the most obvious way of getting stronger and carry more is to build muscle. \"Developing big muscles and stabilising those muscles,\" says Jeffrey Ackerman, an associate teaching professor in mechanical engineering who studies load carrying at the Colorado School of Mines. \"Our bodies are adapted to carrying our own body mass, then when you add a lot of weight, you really need to be doing strength training in a consistent way to grow your bigger load-carrying muscles, [such as your core and auxiliary muscles], that support the motion of your body while you're carrying things. The only way to train these muscles is through intensive and progressive strength training.\" Indeed, higher levels ofskeletal muscle mass tend to correlate with strength, although there aredifferences according to age, particularly as we get older, and sex. And building big muscles alone isn't enough – it is important to trainmuscle activationto get the best from them. But jumping straight into lifting heavy weights is not recommended. Instead, experts recommend focusing on technique and starting with loads that can be comfortably lifted before progressively increasing the training. Progressive weight training, or progressive overload, is the gradual increase of stress (weight) placed on the body.A higher physiological demand means that you need to exert a greater forceto meet it. For example, if you are easily lifting four sets of eight repetitions at a comfortable weight, you need to increase the weight, the number of repetitions or time under tension, to keep improving muscular fitness. Some studies have shown you can get the same benefitsfrom lifting lighter weights with a larger number of repetitionsas heavier weights with fewer repetitions. Other studies suggest thatcombining heavy and lightloads into training may improve strength and power, while multiple sets are also more beneficial. One review of the science concluded that doing multiple sets with rests oftwo to five minutesin between appeared to produce the greatest strength-power benefits. And while most experts recommend a squat technique to lift heavy loads tomaximise overall strength, there is some debate over whetherthis is better for back health or not. There are other ways, however, of increasing how much you can carry without having to spend hours at the gym. And, much like the farmers in Vietnam, some communities have developed techniques to help them shoulder impressive loads often over long distances. At the turn of the 20th Century in England,market portersin London's Covent Garden carried baskets of fruit and vegetables on their heads. Such traditional handling methods are still commonplace today, particularly in developing countries. In north-eastern India, manual load carrying iswidely usedfor transporting goods and materials over long distances, and across difficult terrain – largely due to lack of adequate transport infrastructure and the hilly terrain, but also for economic reasons. In East Africa, women of the Luo people often carry loads equivalent to70% of their body massbalanced on top of their heads,for hours or sometimes days. Research suggests that they have developed an energy-saving strategy in the way they walk, to limit the muscular work needed to carry such loads. Famously, sherpas in the Himalayas routinely take on both shoulder and head-supported loads, where a load is slung on the back and supported with a strap across the forehead. The loads carried often exceed their body mass. Professional porters in the region can manage these loads on journeys taking several days, covering around 60 miles (100km) andascending up to a total of 26,000ft (8,000m) on uneven mountain paths. While researchers are still grappling with its biomechanical advantages, the act of carrying a heavy load like a sherpa essentially counts as a combination of weight training and cardio – both of which are important for carrying loads for long periods of time. \"Many sherpas have been doing it for years and have built up this endurance cardio and core supporting muscle strength,\" says Jeffrey Ackerman, an associate teaching professor in mechanical engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. One studyexamined the sherpa method of carrying by testing 10 physically fit agricultural workers, where each carried 10% then 40% of their body weight while walking on an inclined treadmill. It found that using supports such as a hip and shoulder strap meant that the heart rate and oxygen consumption of participants significantly decreased, as opposed to without the straps. Essentially, the straps help sherpas to either carry loads faster, or for a longer distance. Researchers of load carriagehave found that the ability to lift heavy loads depends on a variety of factors, including age, training regimes, gender, muscular strength and body composition, climate, terrain as well as the position of the load on the body. Some engineers have turned to the idea of a spring-loaded or\"floating\" backpack, to ease the force of loads on the back and shoulders and allowing them to move more naturally with our bodies as we walk. Military load carrying also offers a fascinating lens into our capability of holding extreme weight. Soldiers often wear and carry loads thatexceed 45kg(99lbs), which consist of equipment and weapons for survival and protection, such as body armour, ammunition, patrol packs and heavy boots. This is particularly true where motor vehicles cannot be used, either due to theterrain or to avoid the risk of detection, and therefore survival and mission success often depends on how quickly soldiers can move while carrying such weight. A reviewinto the physical effects of training on load carriage performance in a military environment revealed that combined modes of physical training considerably improved their ability to carry heavy weight – particularly when progressive resistance training was combined with aerobic training, at least three times per week over four weeks. Interestingly,hybrid training, the combination of cardio and strength training, has recently seen a burst of popularity onsocial mediaas runners look to incorporate weightlifting into their routine to reap the benefits of both types of exercise. Indeed,incorporating strength training into your exercise regime is now widely encouraged by national organisations andhealth bodies. For example, theAmerican Heart Associationadvocates for the cardiovascular benefits of doing 30 to 60 minutes of resistance training every week. As a general health guideline, theUS Centres for Disease Control and Preventionrecommend having two days a week where you incorporate some strength training into your routine, as does theNational Health Servicein the UK. This guidance is particularly important in the context of ouraging population– by 2030, 20% of Americans will be aged65 or older. As people age, a naturalloss of muscle mass and strengthoccurs, but if done multiple times a week, strength training can help to preservebone density, reduce the risk of osteoporosis and improve flexibility, sleep and self-confidence. While you may never have to carry a load across mountains like a sherpa or have the urge to break world records like an Olympic weightlifter – perhaps the exceptional power of these people will inspire you to pick up a dumbbell and see how much you can lift.

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "Moments after returning to her home in an affluent neighbourhood in northern Gaza, 44-year-old Sabrine Zanoun said she was overwhelmed with the mix of emotions. \"We are happy to see our family again… [but] it is also so sad it makes you cry - the destroyed houses, the rubble,\" she told the BBC. \"People would come here just to walk because of the beautiful scenery. Now it's mostly ruins.\" Sabrine was one of hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, or the ruins in their place, in northern Gaza on Monday. The mass return comes a week into a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas aimed at permanently ending a war that began more than 15 months ago. Like others in Gaza, she had been displaced several times over the course of the war, but most recently in the central city of Deir al-Balah. She joined a \"flood of people\" who travelled by foot along the coastal al-Rashid Street - a route that opened to displaced Gazans early on Monday morning. One security official in Gaza told AFP news agency that more than 200,000 people had crossed to the north of the strip by foot in a two-hour period. Palestinians spoke to the BBC while making the journey. \"It was so long and tiring,\" said 24-year-old Israa Shaheen, shortly after reaching Gaza City. \"Until the middle of the road, people were happy and singing and stuff like that, but then when it was taking a long time people were getting frustrated. Then we reached a sign that said 'Welcome to Gaza' and a lot of Palestinian flags and people began to feel joy again,\" she said. Others made the journey by car along a different route. \"There are thousands of people here. They're filling the entire road… we are very happy but I am also feeling sad that I know I will reach Gaza City but my home is no longer there,\" 42-year-old Wafaa Hassouna said on the phone as she neared the checkpoint. When people reached their destinations, they spoke of their shock at what remained standing in their communities. Mohammed Imad Al-Din, a barber who had been waiting at the checkpoint, returned to find his home destroyed, and his salon looted and damaged by a nearby Israeli strike. Lubna Nassar had been waiting with her two daughters and son to be reunited with her husband. But while he had survived, their home was gone. \"The warmth of reunion was overshadowed by the bitter reality - we no longer have a home so we moved from a tent in the south to a tent in the north,\" she said. Others are still waiting to make the journeys home or deciding on their next steps. One man said he would have \"run to the north like I was in a race\" if he did not have his pregnant wife and young daughter with him. Instead, they were hoping for the large crowds to pass, and to set off slowly on their journey home. He said they expected to find much of their neighbourhood flattened. \"We hope that this war will end and we'll rebuild everything that is destroyed,\" he said. Another said his brother had told him not to return for now. He \"called and said… the houses are demolished to the ground. People are sleeping on the streets and nobody is helping them.\" In the affluent neighbourhood of Tel al-Hawa, Sabrine said she was grateful to be back with her family and in a home that was still standing. \"It's mostly ruins and destruction. Anyone who finds his house still standing, or even just a room, should consider himself lucky,\" she said. Additional reporting by Muath Al-Khatib A total of 87 hostages, taken captive after the 7 October attacks, still remain unaccounted for. A total of 124 people captured during the 7 October attacks have been released or freed. Israel's prime minister says the \"extensive\" operation aims to \"defeat terrorism\" in the West Bank city. The top figures in Hamas have become targets of Israel since the 7 October attacks. The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war follows 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump's administration has fired more than a dozen justice department lawyers who worked on two criminal cases against him. They were fired after Acting Attorney General James McHenry concluded they could not \"be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president\", a department official told the BBC's US partner CBS News. The lawyers were part of former special counsel Jack Smith's team which investigated Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and his alleged attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat. The firings on Monday are effective immediately. Mr Smith was appointed as special counsel in 2022 to oversee the two justice department cases into Trump. The president had vowed to fire him \"within two seconds\" of taking office,but he quit before his inauguration. Both cases resulted in criminal charges against Trump, who pleaded not guilty. But the cases were closed following his November election win. Prosecutors wrote that justice department regulations do not allow the prosecution of a sitting president. It was not immediately clear which members of Mr Smith's team were fired. Many of those who worked on Mr Smith's teams were career corruption and national security prosecutors who had worked across various administrations and were appointed to the cases. They reportedly received a letter on Monday which said their role in investigating and prosecuting the president made them unsuitable to work in the department. \"Firing prosecutors because of cases they were assigned to work on is just unacceptable,\" former US Attorney Joyce Vance told NBC News. \"It's anti-rule of law; it's anti-democracy.\" The firings follow a major reassignment of some of the justice department's top officials with expertise in a wide range of fields including national security and public corruption. On Monday, one of them, the chief of the public integrity section, reportedly resigned. Trump and his team have accused the justice department of pursuing politically motivated cases against him, his associates and Republicans. Trump vowed an immediate overhaul of the department, which he says has been \"weaponised\" against him, while campaigning for re-election. His nominee to lead the justice department, Pam Bondi,has echoed Trump's view that federal prosecutions against him were political persecution, saying the department \"had been weaponised for years and years and years\". Mr Smith has publicly defended his work. In a letter accompanying the final draft of his report into Trump's actions after the 2020 election, he wrote: \"The claim from [Trump] that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable.\" Also on Monday, Washington DC's top federal prosecutor announced the launch of an internal review into the charging decisions behind hundreds of Capitol riot cases, according to CBS. Acting US Attorney Edward Martin, a Trump appointee, ordered prosecutors in his office to turn in documents, emails and other information related to the previous administration's decision to bring an obstruction charge against more than 200 Capitol attack defendants.

        "title": "How parents unknowingly harm siblings11 Aug 2023Future",
        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "Most parents won't admit it, but a surprising number have a 'hidden favourite' and the way they treat that child compared to their siblings can have long-lasting impacts on their mental health as adults and on family relationships. My siblings and I always knew when our middle brother was coming to visit my parents: my mother would put out little bowls of prawn cocktail, as a special starter. \"Prodigal son,\" we would protest, slightly miffed that the rest of us never had this kind of privileged treatment. The official explanation was that he didn't come over for Sunday lunch as often as the rest of us, but that still didn't really seem fair. In truth, despite the prawn cocktail, I did not think my parents had any favourites. I grew up as one of six siblings in a working-class family in north London. Of course, my brothers, sister and I all had different roles and jobs in the family, but the reasons just seemed practical. As the youngest, for example, I was always the one to go fetch things for my parents, maybe because they thought I had lots of energy anyway. My sister was usually the one to go shopping, because she could drive. It was a busy house and to add to the mix, we also owned a dalmatian dog, Sheba. Overall, it all felt quite even-handed to me. But last year, at a family gathering, one of my brothers blurted out that he thoughtIwas my father's favourite. My sister seemed a bit surprised by that. And I realised that there might be more to the story I had told myself – of our parents not really having favourites. I wondered how people in my and other families really experience these dynamics, and how they might shape us in the long run even if we're not fully aware of them. Research suggests that parental favouritism is surprisingly common – and rather than being just a quirk of family life, can actually be very harmful. It occurs in around65% of families, and has beenidentified and studiedacross manydifferent cultures. As widespread as it is, it can damage children's wellbeing across the lifespan, from theirchildhoodintomiddle ageand beyond. It is considered such an important factor in a range of emotional problems that psychologists have a name and acronym for it: \"parental differential treatment\", or PDT. However, as in my exchange with my brother, siblings in the same family may disagree over whether their family is even affected by it. That's because feeling less-favoured can be very subjective, says Laurie Kramer, a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University in the US. \"It is the experience that people have, that a parent prefers another child to them,\" she says. \"This could be by devoting more time, attention, praise, or affection. Possibly asserting less control, so that they may enjoy fewer restrictions, be subject to less discipline or even punishment.\" Importantly, not everyone in the family may see it that way. \"This may not be the same observation that the other sibling encounters and may be different again for what the parent believes they have engaged in,\" says Kramer. For the person who feels like they are treated as second-best, the consequences can be profound. Research suggests thatfrom an early age, children are aware of differential treatment, such as parents showing more warmth to one sibling than another. Such perceived parental favouritism has been associated withlow self-esteem in children, as well as childhood anxiety,depression, and behavioural problems, includingrisky behaviour. There may also be a knock-on effect on emotional wellbeing that causes other, more indirect problems. Researchers in China have, for example, shown that parental favouritism is a predictor formobile phone addictionin adolescents. In a small Canadian study of eight homeless teenagers, seven said they felt that their parents had favoured a sibling over them, while they had always been the \"problem child\", and that this had contributed to the breakdown of family ties. While this final study is too small to draw wider conclusions, it highlights just how far a child's experience of favouritism can potentially go. The mental health impact may persist into adulthood, with maternal favouritism for example being associated withhigher depression scoresin adult children. The bias itself may also continue in later life, with parents still playing favourites with theiradult children. And while the parents rather than the siblings bear the responsibility for this, favouritism canharm the sibling bondover the life course andincrease tensions and conflict between siblings. This is especially worrying as havinggood relationships with our siblingsis important for our lifelong health and happiness. You might also be interested in: Given how damaging it is, can parents not simply avoid picking a favourite? In Kramer's view, they may not doing so intentionally, and are likely not even aware they are. \"Preferential treatment may begin for parents due to one child being easier to parent, they may relate to that child more, see similarities between them and the child,\" she says. Her research onadolescents and their parentshas shown that familiesdon't tend to talk about this, which makes it even harder to clear up any hurt or misunderstandings. \"If these situations were addressed in a sensitive manner, where no one feels they are being blamed or that it is their fault, you can have more open conversations on all sides to understand,\" Kramer says. Parents could, for example, ask why the child feels they prefer a sibling. \"If a parent listens [and] then provides a reason for the differential behaviours to a child, that can work wonders.\" The child may realise that there is a practical reason, and that it's not about the sibling being loved more. In my family, we had never broached the subject of favouritism, either. But after my brother's throw-away comment on me being the favourite, I decided to find out more. First, I asked my brother why he had made this comment. He replied that our father had once told him off for scaring me with the Mole from the Thunderbirds TV series – a kind of giant drilling machine – and making me cry. I have no recollection of this moment, maybe as I was not on the receiving end of the telling-off. As my siblings and I talked more, we remembered my mother sometimes giving our eldest brother preferential treatment, probably because he was her firstborn. Meanwhile, our father often praised our middle brother for being shrewd, a quality he admired, and which they both shared. And then there's that prawn cocktail that comes out when our middle brother visits, of course. They are small differences, but it's easy to see that they might have amplified into something more and could even have led to resentment. It's possible that the impact was watered down by the fact that there are six of us – and the five who didn't always get the \"prawn cocktail treatment\" could joke to each other about it. And we all still got to enjoy the prawn cocktail when my middle brother visited. Imagine a family with only two grown children, and one is served a prawn cocktail lunch, while the other always gets the plain option: it would probably feel very cruel to that child, like being punished or cut out. Megan Gilligan, an associate professor of human development and family science at the University of Missouri, worked with Jill Suitor, a professor of sociology at Purdue University and Karl Pillemer, a psychology professor at Cornell University, on theWithin-Family Differences Studyin the US, a longitudinal project funded by National institute of Aging. The project has tracked different families for two decades in order to better understand relationships between the generations. As part of the study, the researchers asked mothers and fathers a direct question about favouritism – for many, it was the first time they were asked about it at all. The question was: \"To which of your children do you feel most emotional closeness?\" After a slight deliberation, a high proportion of mothers (75%) then named one of their children. The rest chose none, or said they felt equally close to all of them. They were also asked who they felt more disappointment and conflict with. The answer had consequences across the lifespan, with the child picked early on as \"disappointing\" then alsotreated that way later on. Birth order played a role in some aspects of favouritism, but perhaps not as much as is often assumed. \"In adulthood, [research does not] find this to be an overwhelming predictor of favouritism,\" says Gilligan. Specifically, my guess that the first-born would naturally be picked as the \"golden child\" is not backed up by the scientific research. For emotional closeness, last-born children are actually more likely to be chosen than the middle or first child, Gilligan says. But the strongest predictor for emotional closeness were the parent's feelings of the child being similar to them. Gilligan also highlighted the real damage that can result from differential treatment, which showed up in the longitudinal story, such aspoor sibling relationships, the less-favoured sibling feeling more inadequate about themselves, and having a less positive relationship with the parent. Being the \"golden child\"can also come with pain. \"You might expect being a favourite child to come with many benefits, however, it can also cause emotional distress for adult children,\" she says. \"We have found favouritism to be associated with higher depressive symptoms for favoured children. We believe that this is because being a mother's favorite child creates conflict in their favoured children's relationships with their siblings. We have found that that this tension with siblings in adulthood is consequential for psychological well-being.\" It may also lead to an unequal burden later in life. When a parent eventually requires care by family, they oftenturn to the child they feel was the favoured one, she says. And while favouritism canhaunt us even as adults, our experience of it canchange subtly as we age. Gillian authored a review of studies on theimpact of favouritism across the lifespan, from very young children to grown children now in their 60s or older. She found that there are differences in how it shows up at different stages. For younger children, favouritism may be more about how much time parents spend with them compared to a sibling. For adult children, it may be more about unequal financial support. The answer is not to treat all of one's children exactly the same, says Kramer. \"It is impossible to treat kids the same in every situation, and neither do children want this,\" she says. \"They want to be understood for who they are, their age, interest, gender, personality.\" Still, being more self-aware can help parents avoid consistently causing unfair situations, she says. This is especially important as children may learn the pattern of favouritism, and as adults, apply it to their own parenting style and relationships: \"Unless we are aware and take action to break that transmission, we are likely to engage in the same behaviour.\" The idea of learning certain biases from our parents, certainly rings true. My mother would always plate up slightly larger portions for my brothers, as they were seen as \"growing lads\". My partner has noticed that when I dish up our evening meal, I do the same, serving him more than myself. I don't feel traumatised by the slight differences in the way my siblings and I were treated as children, and perhaps, even today. We are close to our parents, and to each other. Looking back, our pet dog, Sheba, was possibly my dad's real favourite. But becoming more aware of some of these differences in treatment, and how they've shaped my own behaviour, has made me see a few things in a different light. For a start, I might try serving myself larger portions in the future – and I don't wait for my brother to visit to treat myself to a prawn cocktail. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us onFacebook, or follow us onTwitterorInstagram.

        "title": "How a kabaddi club in India is changing girls' lives3 hrs agoAsia",
        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "Meena's eyes dart from left to right and back again, searching for the fleeting moment when she can make her move. She is playing Kabaddi, an Indian contact sport now played in more than 50 countries across the world. A Kabaddi game is played between two teams, each with seven players. Individuals take turns to run into the opposition's half of the pitch to tag opponents and make it back to their own half without being tackled to the ground. But for 14-year-old Meena, this is about more than winning points. The sport offers an escape from a restricted, rural life and opens up a world of opportunities. \"It feels different when I play,\" she says shyly, struggling to find the words. \"In that moment, I am not the Meena who is bound to housework, weighed down by pressures and expectations. It's just me and the opponent… It feels like I am more powerful than other girls who don't play.\" Meena lives on the outskirts of a small tribal village, Kudoshi, about 230km away from India's financial capital, Mumbai, where girls' lives traditionally revolve around household chores, marriage and children. But 15 years ago, a group of teachers at the village school decided they wanted to give girls more opportunities. \"I have a daughter. I want her to achieve things in life, live the best life she can, be something,\" says one of them, Daji Rajguru. \"Why can't girls play Kabaddi and make a career out of it?\" So he and his colleagues, who had played Kabaddi when they were younger, thought it would be good to teach local girls how to play. The pooled their savings - 5,000 rupees ($60; £50) - persuaded the school to let them use its grounds, and opened what they believe was the region's first all-girls Kabaddi club. At the start, just two girls, who were pupils at the school, joined up. \"Parents were not ready to let their girls play Kabaddi as it meant spending a lot of time away from home,\" he says. \"They also worried about the impact it might have on their daughter's marriage prospects,\" as traditional families would not approve of girls going out and coming home late. Daji and his colleagues went door to door reassuring parents their daughters would be safe playing Kabaddi at training sessions before and after school. They reassured them they would supervise the girls properly and not let them be distracted by boys. At the start, the teachers would pick the girls up from their homes and drop them off, but as numbers grew they were no longer able to do that. Now, there are about 30 girls in the club and they estimate that about 300 have trained with them since they began coaching, including Daji's own daughter. Some start playing as young as seven years old. Like the rest of the members of the club, Meena trains for two hours before school and two hours after classes finish. She has to leave home at dawn and doesn't get back until nightfall. \"I go alone and it's dark [in the morning]. I used to be afraid that somebody could do something to me. My family was not supportive then, and are still unhappy with my choice to become a sportswoman,\" she says. But she is persevering, inspired by club members who have excelled over the years and joined state teams or local leagues.  Siddhi Chalke and Samreen Burandkar were among the first batch of girls who trained at the club for about eight years. Now, at the age of 25, they are professional league players and are financially independent. At the start, their families thought playing Kabaddi was a phase that would pass, and when the women decided to make a career of it, their parents were not happy. There is still pressure for them to get married but at the same time their families are also proud that the women are doing well. \"No-one in my family earns as much as I do,\" says Samreen. \"I now live in a big city and get to make my own choices. Coming from my community, it's difficult for girls to go after what they want. I am only here because of Kabaddi,\" she says. Siddhi plays on the same team as Samreen - their friendship born out of Kabaddi. They have travelled around India for competitions, winning medals and championships. \"I could only do that because of Kabaddi. Otherwise, I would have been married and ended up at my husband's place washing the dishes,\" says Siddhi and they both laugh, seemingly relieved that they have escaped this fate. Excelling in sports in India can also help players get jobs in the public sector. Indian states allocate jobs for high achievers in sports, guaranteeing an income even after a player's active sporting years are over. Many rural girls take up sport with the dream of getting financial independence via these jobs. It can also help them get greater respect and a sense of identity. \"When we started the sports club, no-one gave any importance to these girls. They were always secondary citizens in their homes, in society,\" says Vilas Bendre, a young coach at the club. \"But we realised that when rural girls climb ahead in their lives through sports, their lives change significantly. The way they talk, the way they carry themselves, their lifestyle, everything changes.\" Even if they haven't become professional sportswomen, many members of the club have seen their confidence grow and have persuaded their families to let them go to university and delay marriage until they are older. The community has become more accepting too, and when they see girls exercising, people don't frown at them any more. The club is funded by the coaches, cash prizes that the team win in competitions and occasional donations. Most of the girls are from poor and underprivileged families and don't have to pay any subscription fees. As well as training in term time, the club organises and funds residential sports camps at the school in the summer, provides food such as eggs, bananas and milk, and often pays for treatment for players' injuries. Over time, parents' fears have been assuaged, but critics sometimes question the coaches' motives. \"People say things indirectly like. 'Why don't you coach boys?'\" says Daji. But he says there are already opportunities for boys, and there is a gap when it comes to girls. \"We are not just their coaches,\" adds Vilas. \"At times we are their parents, guiding them, disciplining them, helping them make the right choice.\" And Meena knows the potential of this prized opportunity: \"I want to be the best raider and become the captain of India's Kabaddi team,\" she says, daring to dream about medals, championships and leaving an ordinary village girl's life behind.

        "title": "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it’s possible10 Jul 2024BBC InDepth",
        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "It's long been known that our lifestyles can help to keep us healthier for longer. Now scientists are asking whether new technology can also help slow down the ageing process of our brains by keeping track of what happens to them as we get older. One sunny morning, 76-year-old Dutch-born Marijke and her husband Tom welcomed me in for breakfast at their home in Loma Linda, an hour east of Los Angeles. Oatmeal, chai seeds, berries, but no processed sugary cereal or coffee were served - a breakfast as pure as Loma Linda’s mission. Loma Linda has been identified as one of the world’s so-called Blue Zones, places where people have lengthier-than-average lifespans. In this case, it is the city’s Seventh-Day Adventist Church community who are living longer. They generally don’t drink alcohol or caffeine, stick to a vegetarian or even vegan diet and consider it a duty of their religion to look after their bodies as best they can. This is their “health message”, as they call it, and it has put them on the map - the city has been the subject of decades of research into why its residents live better for longer. Dr Gary Fraser from the University of Loma Linda told me members of the Seventh-Day Adventist community there can expect not only a longer lifespan, but an increased “healthspan” - that is, time spent in good health - of four to five years extra for women and seven years extra for men. Marijke and Tom had moved to the city later in life, but both were now firmly embedded in the community. There’s no great secret to Loma Linda. Its citizens are simply living a really healthy life, keeping mentally stimulated and valuing the community a religion can often provide. There are regular lectures on healthy living, musical get-togethers and exercise classes. I chatted to Judy, who lives with 112 others at an assisted living facility where there was always the “ability to have heart-opening, brain-opening conversations”, she told me. “What I didn't realise was how important socialisation is to your brain... without it, it seems to shrink and go away,” Judy said. Science has long recognised the benefits of social interactions and avoiding loneliness. But now it's also possible to identify whose brains are ageing faster than they should, so they can be tracked and in future potentially be treated better preventatively. As we move towards more personalised, predictive, preventative healthcare models, early diagnosis will be crucial in all areas of health - powered by the incredible possibilities of AI and big data. Click: Mind over matter Lara Lewington travels to California to meet the scientists and experts researching our brain health and investigating whether we can change how our brains age. Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK only) Computer models that assess how our brains age and predict their decline were shown to me by Andrei Irimia, associate professor of gerontology and computational biology at the University of Southern California. He had created them using MRI scans, data from 15,000 brains and the power of artificial intelligence to understand the trajectory of both brains that are ageing healthily and those in which there is a disease process, such as dementia. “It's a very sophisticated way to look at patterns that we don't necessarily know about as humans, but the AI algorithm is able to pick up on them,” he said. Prof Irimia did, of course, take a look inside my head. I'd had a functional MRI scan ahead of my visit and, after analysing its results, Prof Irimia told me I had a brain age eight months older than my chronological age (although apparently the bit that controls talking wasn’t ageing so much. I could have told him that). However, Prof Irimia suggested that the results fall within a two-year error margin. Private companies are starting to commercialise this technology, too. One firm, Brainkey, is offering the service in a variety of clinics around the world. Its founder Owen Philips told me that in future, getting an MRI should become easier. \"It’s becoming much more accessible for people to get an MRI scan, and the images coming off them are getting even better and better,” he said. “I don't mean to nerd out there. But the technology is just getting to a point where we are able to see things much earlier than we could in the past. And that means we can understand exactly what's happening in an individual patient's brain. With AI, we can support that.” In contrast to what Prof Irimia’s analysis of my MRI scan had told me, Brainkey’s estimate knocked a year off my brain’s biological age. I was also presented with a 3D-printed model of it, which appeared substantial and, I was assured, was life-sized. The aim here is not just a more precise approach to treatment, but also to be able to quantify how well any interventions are working. Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the past 200 years have given rise to a host of age-related diseases. I did wonder whether, if we all lived long enough, dementia might come knocking at all our doors. Prof Irimia said this was a theory many have investigated albeit not proven, adding that the aim was to find a way to keep on pushing dementia back, hopefully beyond our life expectancies. And all of this takes us back to the same point. Every scientist and doctor, as well as those Blue Zoners, say lifestyle is key. Good diet, keeping active, mentally stimulated and happy are crucial to how our brains age. There’s another important factor too, according to Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the best-selling book Why We Sleep. “Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do every day to reset your brain and body health,” he evangelised. “There is no operation of your mind that is not wonderfully enhanced when you get sleep, or demonstrably impaired when you don’t get enough.” He spoke of our brains’ cleansing system, which functions during our slumber by washing away the beta-amyloid and tau proteins - these are “two of the main culprits underlying Alzheimer’s”. Changes in sleep patterns are also associated with dementia. Prof Walker described how we don’t just see this in our 60s or 70s - it can begin during our 30s. So, identifying those changes through sleep tracking could potentially become a “model of midlife prevention”. Fauna Bio, a biotech company on the outskirts of San Francisco, is collecting data on ground squirrels during and after hibernation. In this state of torpor, as it is known, the squirrels’ body temperature drops and their metabolic rate is reduced to just 1% of normal. During this time, they appear to be able to regrow neurons and remake the connections their brains had lost. The company’s aim is to try and create drugs to replicate this process in humans, without them needing to spend half the year underground. Even if some may long for that. Untreated depression has also been shown to raise our risk of dementia. Professor Leanne Williams of Stanford University has identified a method of “visualising” some forms of depression on the brain using an MRI scan, and thus seeing if treatment has worked. This may be able to help scientists understand more about the root causes of mental health conditions such as depression, as well as providing a way to quantify how treatment is going for a patient. Few have put more faith in science to achieve longevity than Bryan Johnson - the tech entrepreneur spending millions in an effort to reverse his biological age. Dozens of supplements, 19 hours a day of fasting, workouts that make him look as though he’s going to burst and an array of (sometimes controversial) treatments are what he hopes will turn back the clock. But as 103-year-old Mildred, who I visited in Loma Linda said forcefully, “You absolutely need to be very careful with your diet, it’s true, but I’m not down for, ‘You've got to do this, and this, and this, andabsolutely not touch this!'”. She thinks it’s more important we live a little, and let’s face it, she should know.

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "The Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by Soviet troops on 27 January 1945. Anita Lasker, a Jewish teenager, managed to survive there simply because the camp orchestra needed a cello player. Now aged 99, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch is the last remaining survivor of the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz. At the age of 19, she was interviewed by the BBC on 15 April 1945, the day of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen death camp where she had been transferred six months earlier. Interviewed in German, the language she grew up speaking, she said: \"First, I would like to say a few words about Auschwitz. The few who have survived are afraid that the world will not believe what happened there.\" Warning: This article contains graphic details of the Holocaust  She continued: \"A doctor and a commander stood on the ramp when the transports arrived, and sorting was done right before our eyes. This means they asked for the age and health condition of the new arrivals. The unsuspecting newcomers tended to report any ailments, thereby signing their death sentences. They particularly targeted children and the elderly. Right, left, right, left. To the right was life; to the left, the chimney.\" When she first arrived at theAuschwitzunloading platform known as the ramp, her casual comment that she played the cello was enough to change the direction of her life. \"Music was played to accompany the most terrible things,\" she said. The then Anita Lasker barely spoke German in public again for 50 years after World War Two, but when she was growing up, her hometown of Breslau was part of Germany. Now known asWrocław, it has been part of Poland since the end of the war. Lasker's mother Edith was a talented violinist and her father Alfons was a successful lawyer. As the youngest of three daughters, she grew up in a happy home where music and other cultural pursuits were encouraged. She knew at an early age that she wanted to be a cellist, but outside the sanctuary of her family home, darker forces were stirring. She recalled on aBBC television documentaryin 1996: \"We were the typical assimilated German-Jewish family. We went to a little private school, and I suddenly heard, 'Don't give the Jew the sponge,' and I thought, 'What is all this?'\" By 1938, as antisemitism took hold in Nazi Germany, Lasker's parents couldn't find a cello tutor in Breslau who would teach a Jewish child. She was sent to Berlin to study, but had to rush back to her parents after a night of murder and mayhem. On 9 November 1938, the insidious persecution of Jewish people turned violent as Nazis smashed the windows of homes, businesses and synagogues onKristallnachtor \"the night of broken glass\". Back at home, Lasker's parents continued to instil a love of culture in their children, as \"nobody can take that away from us\". Her eldest sister Marianne escaped in 1939 on theKindertransport, the mission which took thousands of children to safety in Britain just before the war. By 1942, even as \"the world was falling to pieces\", her father still had Anita and her sister Renate discussing sophisticated works such as Friedrich Schiller's tragic play Don Carlos. However, it was \"obvious what was going to happen\", she said. In April 1942, the dreaded order came for her parents to report to a certain location within 24 hours. \"We walked through Breslau, not just my parents but a whole column of people, to this particular point and said goodbye. That was the end. I only understood what my parents must have gone through when I became a parent myself. By then, one had already started to suppress the luxury of feelings.\" Anita and Renate were sent to a Jewish orphanage, but they soon hatched a plan to escape from Nazi Germany. Posing as women on their way home to unoccupied France, they set off with two friends for Breslau railway station clutching forged papers. The plan failed and they were arrested by officers of the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police force. Anita served about 18 months in jail on charges of forgery, aiding the enemy and attempted escape, but at least she was relatively safe there. \"Prison is not a pleasant place to be in, but it's not a concentration camp,\" she said. \"Nobody kills you in a prison.\" In 1943, because of overcrowding in Breslau prison, any remaining Jewish people were relocated to concentration camps. Anita was put on a train to be taken to Auschwitz, and Renate was sent two weeks later. Anita arrived in the camp at night to find a terrible scene: \"I remember it was very noisy and totally bewildering. You had no idea where you were. Noisy with the dogs, people screaming, a horrible smell... You'd arrived in hell, really.\" Upon arrival, she was tattooed and shaved by Auschwitz prisoners who were eager for any news about the war. \"I said, 'Look, I can't tell you too much because I've been in prison for a long time,' and casually mentioned that I played the cello. And this girl said, 'Oh, that is very good. You might be saved.' The situation was unbelievable, really. I was naked, I had no hair, I had a number on my arm, and I had this ridiculous conversation. She went and got Alma Rosé, who was the conductor of the orchestra, so I became a member of the famous Women's Orchestra.\" In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter. Alma Rosé was a niece of composer Gustav Mahler, while her father was leader of the Vienna Philharmonic. The violinist ran the camp orchestra with fearsome professionalism, according to Lasker: \"She succeeded in making us so worried about what we were going to play and whether we were playing well that we temporarily didn't worry about what was going to happen to us.\" Using instruments stolen from other people who had been brought to the camp, the orchestra played its limited repertoire of military music. \"Our job was to play marches for the columns that worked outside the camp when they marched out, and in the evening when they came back in,\" she said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4'sDesert Island Discsin 1996, Lasker said that while Rosé set \"enormously high standards\", she did not think it was because of a fear of being murdered if they failed to play well. \"It was an escape somehow into excellence,\" she said. \"Somehow you come to terms with the fact that eventually they're going to get you, but whilst they haven't got you, you just carry on. I think one of the ingredients of survival was to be with other people. I think anybody on their own really didn't have a chance.\" From Auschwitz to Belsen Rosé did not survive the war, dying of suspected botulism in April 1944. Lasker said: \"I think we owe our lives to Alma. She had a dignity which imposed itself even on the Germans. Even the Germans treated her as if she were a member of the human race.\" The music stopped in October 1944 when the women were transferred to Belsen, a concentration camp where there was no orchestra. Conditions there were unimaginably awful. Lasker said: \"It wasn't actually an extermination camp – it was a camp where people perished. There were no gas chambers there, no need for gas chambers – you just died of disease, of starvation.\" Theliberation of Belsenby British troops in April 1945 saved her life. \"I think another week and we probably wouldn't have made it because there was no food and no water left,\" she said. More like this: •The man who saved 669 children from the Nazis •Anne Frank's father on his daughter's diary •How WW2's D-Day began with a death-defying mission After the war, Anita and Renate contacted their sister Marianne in the UK, and in 1946 they both settled in Britain. Renate went on to work as an author and journalist, moving to France with her husband in 1982. She died in 2021, 11 days shy of her 97th birthday. Marianne, the eldest sister who was brought to safety on the Kindertransport, died in childbirth soon after the war. \"Such are the ironies of fate,\" shetold the Guardianin 2005. Anita pursued a career as a successful musician, becoming a founder member of the English Chamber Orchestra. On a visit to Paris, she was put in touch withPeter Wallfisch, a piano student and fellow refugee whom she remembered from her school days in Breslau. They married in 1952 and had two children, cello playerRaphaeland psychotherapistMaya. While Lasker and her husband communicated with each other in \"a total mixture of languages\", she admitted that \"it would have been totally impossible for me to speak German to my children\". For decades, she vowed never again to set foot on German soil, fearing that anyone of a certain age could have been \"the very person who murdered my parents\". With the passage of time, she softened her stance, and by 2018 she was invited to Berlin toaddress politiciansin the Bundestag, the German parliament. She said: \"As you see, I broke my oath – many, many years ago – and I have no regrets. It's quite simple: hate is poison and, ultimately, you poison yourself.\" -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "Denmark has said it will spend 14.6 billion kroner (£1.6bn; $2.05bn) to boost security in the Arctic region, in partnership with its autonomous territories Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The deal includes three new Arctic ships, more long-range drones with advanced image acquisition capacity and stronger satellite capacity. \"We must face the fact that there are serious challenges regarding security and defence in the Arctic and North Atlantic,\" Denmark's Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said. The move comes after US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire Greenland, an island which has wide-ranging autonomy but remains part of Denmark. Asked earlier in January whether he could rule out using military or economic force to pursue his desire to take over the territory, Trumpsaid he could not. Greenland, the world's most sparsely populated territory, is home to about 56,000 mostly indigenous Inuit people. The US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland, establishing military and radio stations across the territory. It has maintained a presence in the region since. Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. In recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. \"Greenland is entering a time of changing threat landscape,\" Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's Independence and Foreign Affairs Minister, said in a statement announcing the new defence spending. \"I am pleased that with this partial agreement we have taken the first step towards strengthening security in and around Greenland.\" An announcement of further funding is expected to come in the first half of this year. The new investment follows Denmark's separate announcement in December thatit was spending roughly £1.2 billionon Greenland's defence, including the purchase of new ships, long-range drones and extra dog sled teams. Poulsen then described the timing of the announcement as an \"irony of fate\" - coming just after Trump said ownership and control of Greenland was an \"absolute necessity\" for the US. Greenland's prime minister has said the territoryis not for sale, adding that \"Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland\". Denmark's prime minister has told Trump thatit is up to Greenlandto decide its own future. Trump has doubled down on his intent since then,despite warningsfrom European countries to not threaten Greenland.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump warns Chinese startup DeepSeek is a wake-up call for America's technology industry The emergence of DeepSeek's low-cost AI chatbot caused shockwaves on Wall Street, withNvidia losing more than $500bn in market value Shares in other major technology firms fell steeply in value when markets opened on Monday.

The Chinese startup released the Janus upgrade as US tech stocks were reeling from the launch of its new AI assistant based on the DeepSeek-V3 model. DeepSeek's AI-powered chatbot has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's store, following its January release in the US. The company's advances in AI training and relatively small budget have raised questions about the multi-billion dollar investments being made into AI infrastructure. In other tech news, President Trump has hinted that Microsoft is looking into buying TikTok's US operations and he added he would like to see a bidding war over the app. Asked by reporters if Microsoft was in talks to buy the app, Trump paused and said: \"I would say yes. A lot of interest in TikTok, great interest in TikTok.\" It comes nearly a week after Trump signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law banning the app if it is not sold. The social media platform briefly went dark in the US earlier this month after the Supreme Court denied a bid by its Chinese owner ByteDance to overturn the legislation. The app came back online in the US shortly after with a short message thanking Trump for his \"efforts\". Experts are describing DeepSeek's technological leap as an important milestone in the race to develop advanced AI systems. \"DeepSeek’s ability to rival US models despite limited access to advanced hardware demonstrates that software ingenuity and data efficiency can compensate for hardware constraints,\" says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, who focuses on China's high-tech industries. \"Western observers often focus on China’s hardware limitations and US restrictions, underestimating the ingenuity and resilience of Chinese companies like DeepSeek.\" Speaking at a Republican congressional retreat in Miami on Monday, US President Donald Trump warns  DeepSeek should be a \"wake-up call\" to US tech firms. His remarks come after DeepSeek's latest AI model sparked a rout in the stocks of some major US tech companies. This video can not be played Trump: DeepSeek AI release should be 'wake-up call' for US Shares in Japan fell on Tuesday after Wall Street saw a big drop in the values of major technology companies. In morning trading, the benchmark Nikkei 225 was around 1.3% lower. Shares in tech-focussed firms including Advantest, Softbank and Tokyo Electron fell sharply. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up a little in early trading. Several other markets in the region are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Mainland China's financial markets will be shut from today and will reopen on 5 February. Stock exchanges in major chip producing countries Taiwan and South Korea are also closed today. As we've been reporting, the launch of DeepSeek-R1 caused market turmoil in the US on Monday morning - including causingtech giant AI chipmaker Nvidia to drop $500 billion in stock price. Founder of DeepSeek Liang Wenfeng had reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips which experts believe had led him to launch DeepSeek - by pairing the chips with cheaper ones. In a statement, a Nvidia spokesperson called DeepSeek \"an excellent AI advancement\" as well as \"a perfect example of\nTest Time Scaling\". \"DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new\nmodels can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models\nand compute that is fully export control compliant,\" the statement adds. \"Inference requires\nsignificant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. \"We now have\nthree scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new\ntest-time scaling.\" The US President Donald Trump says DeepSeek's technology is a wake-up call for the US technology industry, after news of the Chinese startup's latest AI model sparked a selloff in some US tech stocks. \"Hopefully, the release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,\" Trump told a Republican congressional retreat in Miami. The trading day has ended with the stocks of many US tech companies lowering in value after the emergence of a new, low-cost Chinese AI chatbot that has disrupted global markets. Here is a quick recap of key developments:  We are ending our live coverage of DeepSeek for now, but you can stay up to date with our reporting below:  Amazon is one of my companies that have utilised AI for some time Let's step back and explain what artificial intelligence (AI) is and how it works. AI essentially allows a computer to learn, solve problems and fulfil tasks almost like a person. These programmes are trained by taking in huge amounts of information and learning to identify the patterns in it. The result is a computer that can have human-like conversations, for example, or predict a product that an online shopper might by. AI has already been in use for some time. Voice-controlled virtual assistants Siri and Alexa utilise AI technology. Facebook and X have also been using the technology to decide which social media posts to show users. It is also used by Amazon, where AI helps it analyse customers' buying habits and recommend future purchases. Fiona Cincotta, a Senior Market Analyst at City Index, spoke to Radio 4's PM programme about the potential disruption DeepSeek could have on the sector. \"A tiny start up has created a more efficient AI model... this has raised serious questions about the need to spend billions on chips and other AI infrastructure\". \"Fewer chips will be needed, less data will be needed, less power will be needed and and as result, we're just having this re-pricing of expectations and the concerns this latest development could disrupt this sector\", she added. This afternoon, David Sacks - Donald Trump's so-called crypto and artificial intelligence \"tsar\" - says the launch of DeepSeek-R1 indicates the AI race \"will be very competitive\". In a post on X, he says the news today proves the president's efforts to roll back Biden-era technology and AI regulations was \"right\". Last Thursday, the Trump signed an executive order \"removing barriers to American leadership in Artificial Intelligence\". The 2025 order rescinds 2023's Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence executive order. The order says it rolls back \"certain existing AI policies and directives\" that the Trump administration says \"act as barriers\". According to Sacks, the Biden executive order \"hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same\". \"I’m confident in the US but we can't be complacent,\" he adds. It is now the end of the business day on Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange has just closed on the day that  Chinese-developed DeepSeek shot to prominence. Here is where stock prices of several US tech giants stand at the close of markets:  Apple has slightly increased in value today, withAppleup 3.25%, whileMetais also up by 1.91%. Lily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent DeepSeek has roiled US\ntech stocks. Shares of AI chip designer Nvidia alone were down more than 17% in\nmidday trading. \"This is a pretty big flex for China. They're having a big\nnegative impact on the US markets. It's a black eye for US tech,\" said\nDeepwater Management analyst Gene Munster. Munster says there are many\nquestions left unanswered about DeepSeek, including how the model got so good\nas cheaply and quickly as it did. \"This is impressive, but I feel like we're\nonly getting two-thirds of the story,\" says Munster. Despite the shock value,\nMunster thinks DeepSeek's sudden success will only accelerate the need for\nmore hardware. \"If there's a model out there that runs more efficiently, I don't\nthink that changes the desire for the companies that are buying all these\nchips. I don't think it changes their desire to continue to spend like they've\nbeen spending, because the end goal is speed,\" said Munster. \"It's about getting\nto artificial general intelligence fast.\" Cristina Criddle writes about technology for the Financial Times and specialises in artificial intelligence and social media. She told Radio 4's PM programme that since the DeepSeek app was released, it's been a hot topic in the AI world. \"What's it's managed to do is really catch up to the capabilities of some of the leading US models... DeepSeek has in a short amount of time, with relatively little attention, managed to catch up with them on quite a few capabilities like reasoning.\" We've been bringing you the latest developments after the emergence of a new low-cost Chinese AI chatbot startled stock markets in Europe and the US:  Marc CieslakAI correspondent DeepSeek has upended the AI economic applecart. With reported development costs of just $6m, it’s shifted the dial on what many had thought was the cost of doing business in the age of AI. The figures up to now have been eye-watering - Microsoft talked about an $80bn investment in AI, Meta plans to spend $60–65bn on AI infrastructure. Deepseek’s sudden rise suggests a lower-cost, open-source model can challenge that economic wisdom. And it highlights the potential for cheaper, innovative solutions for those without the financial resources of the major US tech companies. The UK government is betting big on AI as a driver for economic growth, as well as a means of cutting the cost of providing public services. While there are still many questions surrounding Deepseek, the perception that the price of achieving lofty AI goals has shifted slightly and might not be as costly as first anticipated. DeepSeek has been hailed for being low-cost compared to other AI chatbots. It works by activating only the most relevant parts of its model for each query it receives, which saves money and computation power. The model has been praised by some. Tech investor Marc Andreessen wrote on X shortly after the DeepSeek app's launch that it is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs\" he has seen in open source AI, calling it \"a profound gift to the world\". Aside from the way it processes data, DeepSeek appears to be relatively similar to other AI chatbots on the market, like ChatGPT, making it a legitimate rival to these applications. Its emergence has upended Wall Street, and has raised questions in the US on whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector. Trump announcing Stargate with the heads of Oracle, SoftBank and OpenAI The emergence of the Chinese made AI-app DeepSeek comes on the heels of a major announcement by President Donald Trump to advance AI development in the US. Last week, Trump unveiled Stargate - a $500bn AI venture that will be financed and carried out by three companies: OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle. The project is meant to accelerate AI development in the US, with Trump hailing it “the future of technology”. Sam Altman of OpenAI called it “the most important project of this era”. The money will be used to construct data centres in the US to support AI development. Those centres will be used by OpenAI to develop artificial intelligence technology that can be used in a wide range of sectors. Tesla’s Elon Musk criticised the venture shortly after it was announced, writing on X that the three companies don’t have the money to fund the ambitious project. Altman hit back at Musk, replying, “wrong, as you surely know\". Both Musk - who helped found OpenAI - and Altman had been embroiled in a public feud since Musk broke away from the company in 2018. The BBC has spoken to Kayla Blomquist, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute and director of the Oxford China Policy Lab, to find out if there will be similar AI firms to DeepSeek emerging from China. She says the AI business is a \"vibrant ecosystem in China\". \"I think we'll continue to see examples of this (AI firms) that pop up and catch everyone's attention and rightly so.\" When asked how much involvement there is from China's government, Blomquist says officials have been hands-off and allow things to develop organically. “I would say there's a shift as we've seen an announcement in huge investment from the central government just in the last week. And so that is probably going to signal a change moving forward.” Lily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent An initial test-run of China’s DeepSeek shows it can offer a similar experience to what you’d find on competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini – but it depends on what you ask. Enter “Who is Alexander Hamilton?” and you’ll get a 449-word summary of Hamilton’s life and influence. While I can’t verify that it’s all correct, it seems to track pretty closely with what I recall from the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical. It also adeptly handled a prompt asking what I can make with corn, pinto beans, and cabbage on hand. So it just might be Southwestern Cabbage Stir-Fry for dinner. But politically sensitive questions cause DeepSeek to literally censor its own responses. When asked what happened at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, DeepSeek replied: “I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.\" We then asked: “Can you tell me about Kate Adie’s reports from Asia.” (Adie was on the ground in Tiananmen Square when the historic massacre occurred). DeepSeek started to respond: “Kate Adie, a renowned British journalist and former BBC Chief News Correspondent, is widely recognized for her ground-breaking reporting from conflict zones and significant global events, including several in Asia.” But then it stopped, deleting that response, and wrote: “Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.” © 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",

        "source": "https://www.bleacherreport.com/",
        "content": " After Dalton Kincaiddroppeda tough pass from Josh Allen on a crucial fourth-and-5 in the Buffalo Bills' 32-29 AFC Championship loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Allen is shouldering the blame for the play. \"I got to be better for him,\" Allen said, per ESPN'sAlaina Getzenberg. \"I didn't feel like I put him in enough good situations this year, ball placement wise... He can sit there and think about that play over and over, but I got to be better for him. That's what it comes down to and get him more involved.\" Kincaid faced criticism following the play, as the ball slipped through his arms, potentially setting up a game-tying field goal attempt for kicker Tyler Bass. However, Bills teammates were quick to emphasize that a single play did not decide the outcome of the game. Linebacker Terrel Bernard echoed Allen's sentiments. \"I think it's unfair, honestly, to even say (Kincaid lost them the game) and put him in that situation,\" Bernard said, per Getzenberg. \"There's so many plays that it comes down to throughout a game, and we just didn't make enough of 'em.\" Allen had nothing but praise for the tight end, highlighting Kincaid's toughness and consistent contributions throughout the season for the 13-4 Bills squad. \"I know he's been battling throughout the entire year, bumps and bruises and probably games that he shouldn't have played he was in, but he's a tough sucker, and I got nothing but, love for him, how he's approached this year,\" Allen said, per Getzenberg. \"He's going to be so much better next year. Let his body heal up, and I'm going to be better, better for him and I can promise you that.\" Prior to the drop, the second-year player recorded two catches for 13 yards in the game. He wrapped up the regular season with 448 yards on 44 receptions and two touchdowns, adding six catches for 71 yards in the playoffs. Despite his successful season, the play hit much harder for Kincaid as he heads into the offseason, being on the receiving end of the criticism. \"Just an opportunity for a play to be made, and just couldn't make the play,\" Kincaid said after the game, per Getzenberg. In response to the drop, Baltimore Ravens fans created aGoFundMewith proceeds going to the Summit Center for Autism, a charity Kincaid has worked with in the past. The goal is $10,000 and as of Monday afternoon, it has raised $3,001. The move comes after Bills Mafia opened aGoFundMefor Baltimore tight end Mark Andrews following a crucial dropped pass that could have lifted the Ravens to the AFC Championship game, directing funds to the Breakthrough T1D charity. It is clear that no one on the team will enter the offseason holding Kincaid accountable for the drop, with everyone taking accountability for trailing throughout the game. Soon the play will be something of the pass for the Bills.",

        "source": "https://www.bleacherreport.com/",
        "content": " Before getting into the nitty gritty, I'd like to state the obvious: The opening slate was a success. The game play was high-paced and exciting, even as you saw teams and players clearly trying to feel things out on the pace and shot-selection front. TheElam endingwinning-score concept—the final quarter being an untimed race to a target score (plus-11 to the leading team's score after three quarters)—led to heightened stakes. Skylar Diggins-Smith calling game—and letting people know about it—was awesome. Oh, and people engaged with the league at large. Opening night of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Unrivaledwbb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Unrivaledwbb</a> delivered strong 💪viewership and engagement across TNT Sports platforms:<br><br>🏀 Most watched WBB games on TNT Sports platforms ever<br>🏀 WBB viewership record for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SportsonMax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SportsonMax</a> <br>🏀 31m views of Unrivaled content across <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BleacherReport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BleacherReport</a> platforms<br><br>More ⤵️ <a href=\"https://t.co/HOXR6vFFhw\">pic.twitter.com/HOXR6vFFhw</a> We'll take that! With the opening week(end) of Unrivaled in the books, it's time for updated power rankings. Naturally, there's going to be quite a bit of movement from last week's version; having games to judge helps with this kind of thing. Who knew? As the sample of games grows, there likely won't bemassiveswings from week to week. But for now, hop on the reaction train with me. Let's dig in.  Head coach: Adam Harrington Roster: Natasha Cloud (Mercury), Brittney Griner (Mercury*), Sabrina Ionescu (Liberty), Marina Mabrey (Sun; out 2-4 weeks with calf strain), Satou Sabally (Wings*), Katie Lou Samuelson (Fever), Natisha Hiedeman (Lynx; injury replacement for Mabrey) Preseason Ranking:1st Week in review (0-2): 86-48 loss to Laces BC, 84-69 loss to Vinyl What to like: A step up in defensive effort When you lose two games by 53 points, there isn't much to smile about. If we're looking for positives, it's worth acknowledging how much cleaner their defense looked against the Vinyl compared to their opening loss to the Laces. They started smaller (more on that shortly), and you could feel the shift immediately. The first half in particular saw them switch on and off-ball screens more cleanly. There was also an uptick in ball pressure, especially on possessions where the Vinyl used a big (Dearica Hamby or Aliyah Boston) as a hub on the perimeter. File this in the \"Duh!\" department, but they'll need to build on that effort. Something to keep an eye on: The big rotation Brittney Griner got the start against the Laces on Saturday and frankly, the minutes didn't go well. She was constantly caught in tough positions defensively—oscillating between hanging too far back and opening up pockets for pull-ups or working toward the level of screens to compensate for one of her teammates getting clipped on a screen and having players slip behind her in the process. To the latter point, the defensive breakdowns that she was involved in weren't always her fault. It did, however, highlight some of the concern I had about her scheme versatility in this format. None of this would feel as dire as it did if the smaller groups, with Sabally (rough in Game 1, better in Game 2) or Samuelson (whew, buddy...) as the center, were able to end possessions consistently. They did a better job of making the Vinyl work and ultimately forcing misses, but the Vinyl had eight offensive rebounds, It's obviously early, but I'm interested in seeing what kind of balance the Phantom strike with their lineups. * = Player's WNBA contract status is uncertain for 2025  Head Coach: Phil Handy Roster: DiJonai Carrington (Sun*), Aaliyah Edwards (Mystics), Rickea Jackson (Sparks), Jewell Loyd (Storm), Breanna Stewart (Liberty*), Courtney Vandersloot (Liberty*) Preseason Ranking: 2nd Week in review (0-2): 84-80 loss to Lunar Owls BC, 63-43 loss to Laces BC What to like: Mismatch-hunting It wasn't a fruitful week in the standings, but the Mist have shown flashes of why they should be major players during this season. Near the top of the list is their ability to make you feel uncomfortable. Vandersloot screening for Stewart, onoroff the ball, is a conundrum that hasn't really been solved here or in the WNBA. Loyd's gotten in on the screen-for-Stewie fun as well. Jackson's a walking mismatch; her third quarter run against the Lunar Owls in the opener was a rather loud example of the problems she can pose. Something to keep an eye on: Point DiJonai There have been stretches in both games where Loyd and Vandersloot have been on the bench together, opening the door for primary initiator reps for Carrington. The results have been mixed; we've seen quick (and correct) decisions, and we've also seen some turnovers due to placement and velocity issues. I care less about the latter, and more that she's getting the opportunity to begin with. Her being able to handle more on-ball responsibility should pay off in the short-term—I really like the Carrington-Jackson-Stewart lineup in theory—and in the long-term as we think about her WNBA utility.  Head Coach: Nola Henry Roster: Kahleah Copper (Mercury), Chelsea Gray (Aces), Lexie Hull (Fever), Angel Reese (Sky), Azurá Stevens (Sparks), Brittney Sykes (Mystics) Preseason Ranking: 4th Week in review (0-2): 79-73 loss to Vinyl BC, 79-70 loss to Lunar Owls BC What to like: Chelsea Gray setting the table This may shock you, but Gray (and Courtney Williams!) sits atop the assist leaderboard (12) through two games. It's been her usual brand of awesomeness on that front: on-target pocket passes to Reese (keep an eye on her self-created looks!) and Stevens, lasers to Copper and Sykes on cuts, a no-look over-the-head pass because why not...you know what you're signing up for. Something to keep an eye on: The rotation It's way too early to sound the alarm, but tracking the lineups (and general minutes distribution) with this group has been interesting, to say the least. We've seen Reese as the lone big. We've seen Stevens as the lone big. Against the Lunar Owls, they closed the game with Gray, Copper and Sykes despite Napheesa Collier having a size mismatch. We mostlyhaven'tseen Hull, as she's only logged nine minutes across the first two games—and part of those minutes came with no other big on the floor. This is a versatile roster on paper; it's perfectly OK for the rotation to be a work in progress (checks notes) two games in. But it's worth monitoring.  Head Coach: Teresa Weatherspoon Roster: Aliyah Boston (Fever), Rae Burrell (Sparks), Jordin Canada (Dream), Dearica Hamby (Sparks), Rhyne Howard (Dream), Arike Ogunbowale (Wings) Preseason Ranking: 3rd Week in review: 79-73 win over Rose BC, 84-69 win over Phantom BC What to like: Dearica Hamby, constantly moving Hamby is one of the players in the league with legit 3x3 experience, so it's not a major surprise that she immediately looked comfortable with the enhanced spacing and heightened pace offensively. There were copious hub-screen-seal possessions from Hamby over the weekend, especially in her game against the Phantom. That kind of activity is additive for the group; her passing from the perimeter opened up driving lanes for Ogunbowale, Howard, Canada and Burrell. Her screening did the same, and her seals against smaller defenders proved to be an important fail-safe in the half court. Something to keep an eye on: Rae Burrell's on-ball juice There's been plenty of buzz about Burrell heading into opening week. Unrivaled president Alex Bazzellhighlighted her playduring preseason action. Head coach Teresa Weatherspoon expressed her excitement about coaching Burrell, saying there's \"something about Rae that the basketball world hasn't seen.\" I've been impressed with Burrell offensively so far. Her transition prowess has translated well to this format, and I'd expect that to continue. What really intrigues me is the on-ball juice. Watching her spearhead pick-and-rolls without a hitch has been a fun development. I hope she continues to get reps, because that kind of comfort could unlock a new world for her once the WNBA season begins.  Head Coach: DJ Sackmann Roster: Shakira Austin (Mystics), Cameron Brink (Sparks; out with Torn ACL), Napheesa Collier (Lynx), Skylar Diggins-Smith (Storm), Allisha Gray (Dream), Courtney Williams (Lynx) Preseason Ranking: 6th Week in review: 84-80 win over Mist BC, 79-70 win over Rose BC What to like: Poking at defenses My favorite bit from the weekend was the Lunar Owls leaning heavily into \"Chicago\" action—a three-player action where a player flies off an off-ball screen (pindown) before receiving a dribble handoff—during the second half of their comeback win against the Mist. Diggins-Smith was able to drain a pair of triples from the right wing, draw a shooting foul on a fading middy and string out the defense to force a small-on-big switch that led to a Collier basket. I'm a sucker for a run-it-until-they-stop-it stretch. That wasn't the only action they had success with, but it was a loud example of the kind of problems they can (and did) pose for defenses. Having scheme-specific answers and scheme-proof players (hi, Phee!) really is a luxury. Something to keep an eye on: Pick-up points defensively Heading into Week 1, I was excited to learn about some team-specific quirks. One of the things that popped early on film was how high/quickly the Lunar Owls would pick up ball-handlers defensively. They were pretty consistent with pressuring the ball well behind half court; you can do that when you have Diggins-Smith and Gray (who wasphenomenalall weekend defensively) at the point of attack. With that being on film, I'm curious to see how teams work to counter that. Will we see more screens set at or behind half court? Will the Lunar Owls want to dial the pressure back in an effort to conserve energy? We shall see.  Head Coach: Andrew Wade Roster: Stefanie Dolson (Mystics), Tiffany Hayes (Aces*), Kate Martin (Valkyries), Kayla McBride (Lynx), Alyssa Thomas (Sun*), Jackie Young (Aces; out with knee injury) Preseason Ranking: 5th Week in review: 86-48 win over Phantom BC, 63-43 win over Mist BC What to like: Balance The cutting and general off-ball prowess of this group was identified in the opening power ranking as something to be excited about. Yet, I still found myself surprised by how effective they were at generating and capitalizing on advantages. The screening of Thomas and Dolson consistently created openings for the guards and wings in pick-and-roll. Thomas in particular did a tremendous job of bullying smaller players after switches. McBride's mix of pull-ups and quick-hitting drives kept defenses on their toes. Hayes was a blur in transition and early-offense situations, and her knack for offensive rebounding flashed on occasion. We'll have more on Martin shortly. The cutting popped in their two wins, but I especially appreciated how the Laces utilized screens to set up (mid) post touches before jetting to the basket for easy ones. All five players—Young (knee) missed both games—scored in double figures in their blowout win over Phantom BC. And despite a poor shooting performance against the Mist, all but Dolson scored in double digits in that game. Their 33 assists (16.5 average) lead all teams. Something to keep an eye on: Kate Martin's aggression I was fully in on Martin as a cutter, screener and spot-up shooter with this group heading into the season. Those qualities were on display over the weekend, with one of the louder examples being her game-clinching pass-and-cut against Phantom BC. Martin's aggression in pick-and-roll has been a pleasant surprise. Watching her hunt pull-ups, particularly when players duck under screens against her, is the kind of processing and controlled aggression you want to see from her in this environment. We'll see if that continues this week.",

        "content": " The four-man field for the 2025 Slam Dunk Contest is set. According to ESPN'sShams Charania, the Orlando Magic's Mac McClung—the two-time defending Slam Dunk Contest champion—will be joined by San Antonio Spurs rookie Stephon Castle, Chicago Bulls rookie Matas Buzelis and Milwaukee Bucks guard Andre Jackson Jr. in this year's event. McClung is obviously the main attraction. He became not only the first G League player to ever appear in the Dunk Contest back in 2023, but also the first one to ever win it, dazzling fans with a series of memorable moves. And he defended his title last year, clinching the win by dunking over NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal. McClung will be looking to become the first man to ever win three Dunk Contest titles in a row. He would also tie Nate Robinson for the most Dunk Contest championships (three) with a victory. It was unclear if he would pursue the three-peat after his comments following last year's events. \"I don't know. We'll think about it,\" hetold reportersafter his 2024 win when questioned about going for a third straight title. \"I'm not sure yet.\" He'll have some top competition this time around, however. Castle has shown off some serious hops in his rookie season. So has Buzelis. Both Castle and Buzelis have Slam Dunk Contest experience, albeit not at the NBA level, competing at the 2023 McDonald's High School Dunk Contest. Heading into tonight's McDonald's All American Game, Matas Buzelis is already receiving strong interest from several brands on a potential shoe deal.<br><br>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DraftExpress?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DraftExpress</a> projected #1 pick of the 2024 NBA Draft will sign with the G-League Ignite, and can sign a full shoe deal now. <a href=\"https://t.co/Izveqn7D1Q\">pic.twitter.com/Izveqn7D1Q</a> And Jackson's dunking prowess dates back to his high school years. So this should be a fun event. But until someone proves they can unseat McClung, he'll remain the prohibitive favorite.",

        "content": " Jimmy Butler's stand-off with the Miami Heat continues to be costly for the disgruntled star. The Heatannounced Mondaythat Butler is suspended \"without pay effective immediately for an indefinite period to last no fewer than five games\" due to a \"continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services,\" which included \"walking out of practice earlier today.\" As ESPN'sBobby Marksnoted, Butler will lose $532,737 in salary per game, meaning he'll be losing at least $2.7 million from this latest suspension. Butler hadalready lost around $3.1 millionfrom his previous suspensions as he seeks a trade out of Miami. Now, Butler could always seek to get that money back by filing grievances via the NBPA. Ben Simmons and the Philadelphia 76ersreached a settlementback in 2022 after the team suspended him without pay while he sought to force a trade, ultimately restoring a portion of the $20 million in withheld salary during that saga. But regardless, Butler is risking quite a bit of money to force his way out of Miami ahead of the Feb. 6 trade deadline.",

        "source": "https://www.bleacherreport.com/",
        "content": " And then there were two. After Sunday's conference championship games, the participants for Super Bowl LIX are set. If you like sequels, you're in luck—in a rematch of Super Bowl XLVII, the Philadelphia Eagles will attempt to prevent the Kansas City Chiefs from becoming the first team in NFL history to win three straight Super Bowls. The Chiefs won that game 38-35, overcoming a 10-point halftime deficit with a 24-point second half. That game will undoubtedly be analyzed six ways from Sunday—over the next two weeks, that's all we have to do. Analyze. Scrutinize. Proselytize. Should be fun. Of course, much has changed since that game. The Eagles now have running back Saquon Barkley and a revamped secondary. The Chiefs have any number of new faces as well—and the old one that has steered the team to within 60 minutes of history. The Chiefs and Eagles are both excellent teams, but they aren't flawless ones. Both have areas of strength and potential weaknesses. An excellent offensive line, but questions at linebacker. Concerns on the back end, and arguably the greatest quarterback ever. As we kick off the fortnight before the Big Easy Throwdown the Chiefs hope is a Big Easy Threedown, let's take a look at each position group on both teams and where the edges exist that could determine who will lift the Lombardi Trophy at the Superdome.  This position-by-position matchup comparison starts out with a toughie. There's a reason why these teams are playing in the Super Bowl—they are led by two of the very best quarterbacks in the National Football League. Jalen Hurts of the Eagles didn't post especially gaudy numbers throwing the ball in 2024—his 193.5 passing yards per game in the regular season ranked outside the top 25 for the season. Hurts' 246 yards passing in the NFC Championship Game was just the second time since mid-November that he's thrown for 200-plus yards. But Hurts threw just five interceptions in the regular season, ranked third among quarterbacks in rushing yards and tacked on 14 scores on the ground. Still, as dangerous as Hurts may be, he isn't Patrick Mahomes. No one is. Mahomes' numbers in 2024, by his standards at least, were only so-so. Mahomes threw for less than 4,000 yards for the first time since he took over as the Chiefs starter. His 26 touchdown passes tied his career-low as a starter. Mahomes was just 16th in the league in passer rating. But we're talking about the best quarterback of his generation. When all is said and done, Mahomes may be the greatest signal-caller to ever play the game. This will mark Mahomes' fifth Super Bowl trip—and he's yet to celebrate his 30th birthday. Hurts will head to New Orleans knowing that he will have to play his best game of the season. Possibly of his career. Because as the Eagles already found out the hard way in Super Bowl LVII that if you don't bring your absolute best against Mahomes, you will get beat. Advantage:Chiefs  Entering the 2024 season, the plan for the Kansas City Chiefs was for Isiah Pacheco to be the team's lead back. Pacheco averaged 4.6 yards per carry in 2024 and topped 1,100 total yards. That plan went out the window when Pacheco broke his leg, and the Chiefs looked to their past to fill the void, going with Kareem Hunt as the No. 1 back for much of the season. Hunt averaged just 3.6 yards per carry, but he surpassed 900 total yards and kept the Chiefs offense from becoming one-dimensional. Still, for the season, the Chiefs were just 22nd in the NFL running the ball, averaging just over 105 yards per game. The Eagles were, um, better running the ball—and that was because Saquon Barkley went full Godzilla on the NFL in 2024. Against the Washington Commanders in the NFC Championship Game, Barkley logged 118 rushing yards, scored three times and averaged almost eight yards a carry—and that was a below-average game for the 27-year-old. In his first season with the Eagles, Barkley became the ninth running back in NFL history to eclipse 2,000 yards on the ground. He averaged over 125 rushing yards per game, averaged 5.8 yards per carry, caught 33 passes and scored 15 total touchdowns. Barkley now owns the Eagles' franchise records for rushing yards in a season (2,005), the most 100-yard games in a season (12), the most rushing yards in a regular-season game (255) and the most rushing yards in a postseason game (205). The Eagles led the NFC in rushing in 2024, and Barkley was the locomotive for that train. If the Eagles seal the deal and win Super Bowl LIX, Barkley will go down as arguably the most impactful free-agent signing in NFL history. Advantage:Eagles  With Jalen Hurts posting relatively modest passing numbers the past couple of months, the receiving stats for A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith suffered. Both also missed multiple games this season—four apiece. But despite playing in just 13 games, Brown was still able to eclipse 1,000 receiving yards for the third time in as many seasons in Philly. Brown is the prototypical big-bodied No. 1 receiver, and his yards per catch were actually up over two full yards relative to last year. Brown also played a major role in Sunday's NFC title game win, hauling in six of eight targets for 96 yards and a score. For Smith, it was something of a disappointing season statistically—his 833 yards and 12.3 yards per catch were both career lows. But Smith still found the end zone eight times and has a pair of 1,000-yard seasons over four years in the pros. The pair are one of the better duos at the position in the NFL. The Kansas City Chiefs spent considerable resources trying to upgrade a wideout group that struggled to make big plays in 2023. The team signed Marquise Brown in free agency and spent their first draft pick on Texas speedster Xavier Worthy. When Brown got hurt, the Chiefs acquired DeAndre Hopkins from the Tennessee Titans. Worthy has improved as the season has worn on, including six catches, 85 yards, and a score in Sunday's AFC Championship Game win over the Buffalo Bills. But Worthy was the only Chiefs wide receiver to surpass 600 yards for the season. Brown is only now showing flashes of being close to 100 percent, and Hopkins is more big name than big numbers at this point in his career. The Chiefs may have more bodies people have heard of at wide receiver. But the Eagles have the two best receivers in this game. And that could most assuredly matter. Advantage:Eagles  There was a time not that long ago when the tight end comparison between these two teams would have been settled in a hot second—it was Travis Kelce's world, and everyone else was just living in it. But as the old saying goes, Father Time is undefeated, and at 35, Kelce had (by his standards) a down year. His 823 receiving yards were Kelce's fewest since 2013. So were his three touchdown receptions. Dallas Goedert of the Eagles hardly had a flawless season either—injuries limited the seventh-year veteran to 10 games, 42 catches, 496 yards and a pair of touchdowns. However, both tight ends showed glimpses of the impact that makes them high-end starters at their position in the postseason. Kelce was quiet in the AFC Championship Game, but he torched the Houston Texans for seven catches for 117 yards and a score in the Divisional Round. Goedert led the Eagles in receptions in the NFC Championship Game, hauling in seven passes for 85 yards. Both of these tight ends can be real factors in Super Bowl LIX—you can bet the rent that Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio will try to take Patrick Mahomes' favorite passing-game target away. But Kelce has a long history of stepping up in big games. When these teams met in Super Bowl LVII, Kelce caught all six of his targets for 81 yards and a score. Goedert is a quality NFL starter, but Kelce is an all-time great. Add in that Noah Gray is a better second tight end than Grant Calcaterra, and the Chiefs have the edge here. Advantage:Chiefs  It shouldn't surprise that the offensive line is a strength for both of this year's Super Bowl participants.Matt Bitonti of Footballguysranks both lines among the four best in the NFL. As was already mentioned, the Eagles paced the NFC in rushing this season. Philly surrendered 45 sacks in the regular season, but that had as much to do with Jalen Hurts holding the ball and extending plays as deficiencies in the blocking ahead of him. Three of Philly's starters up front (tackle Lane Johnson, guard Landon Dickerson and center Cam Jurgens) were named Pro Bowlers. Johnson and Jordan Mailata were named second-team All-Pro. The strength of Kansas City's line is the interior, and that's where the team received some individual accolades. Guards Joe Thuney and Trey Smith and center Creed Humphrey all made the Pro Bowl, and Humphrey and Thuney both earned first-team All-Pro honors. However, it's not all sunshine and puppies for these offensive lines, because it never is this late in the season. The health of Dickerson and Jurgens will be a hot topic of conversation in the lead-up to Super Bowl LIX. Right tackle Jawaan Taylor has been a penalty machine in Kansas City (17 perPro Football Focus). The left tackle spot has been an issue all season—so much so the team has tried Thuney there at times. The NFC champions have the advantage here, but it's not a glaring one, especially if Jurgens or Dickerson can't play in the Super Bowl. Advantage:Eagles  Where star power on the defensive line in Super Bowl LIX is concerned, Kansas City's Chris Jones is easily the biggest name. Don't pay any attention to Jones' five sacks after 10.5 in 2023—his inclusion as both a Pro Bowler and a first-team All-Pro says more about his impact on games than raw stats. Jones isn't a one-man band on a defensive front that logged 39 sacks in 2024. Edge-rusher George Karlaftis has come into his own in his third season—the 23-year-old has logged 18.5 sacks the past two seasons, adding three more in this year's playoffs. Mike Danna and Tershawn Wharton are capable NFL players. But just as on the offensive side of the ball, the Eagles have an advantage in the trenches on defense. This isn't the Eagles line that terrified the league to the tune of 70 sacks during their last Super Bowl run. Edge-rusher Josh Sweat led the team with eight sacks, and free-agent addition Bryce Huff was a non-factor. But the Eagles are deep up front. Defensive tackle Jalen Carter and edge-rusher Nolan Smith have blossomed in their second seasons, with Carter making the Pro Bowl. Veterans like edge-rusher Brandon Graham and tackle Milton Williams allow Philadelphia to rotate their linemen throughout the game. This isn't a line that gets tired. The winner of this game will likely be the team that more effectively pressures the opposing quarterback. On paper at least, the Eagles are better equipped to do that. Advantage:Eagles  There isn't a better story at the linebacker position this season than Philadelphia's Zack Baun. When Baun joined the Eagles in 2024, he was a seldom-used edge-rusher and special teamer with 88 tackles in four seasons with the New Orleans Saints. After being moved to off-ball linebacker by Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and becoming an every-down starter, Baun finished sixth in the league in stops and became a first-team All-Pro and a Defensive Player of the Year finalist. The problem for the Eagles is that behind Baun...there isn't a lot. With youngster Nakobe Dean out for the season, the Eagles have been forced to turn to a combination of journeyman Oren Burks and rookie Jeremiah Trotter Jr. Burks is a solid reserve, and Trotter may well have a bright future ahead of him, but that spot has become a potential weakness for the Eagles' defense. Meanwhile, while Baun is trying to establish himself as one of the NFL's best off-ball linebackers, Kansas City's Nick Bolton already has. Even in what most consider a \"down\" season for the fourth-year veteran, Bolton has topped 100 total tackles and set a career-high with three sacks. Batterymate Drue Tranquill isn't the same caliber player, but he's a steady veteran who has topped 90 total stops in two of the past three seasons. There's a reason why the Chiefs ranked eighth in the regular season against the run, surrendering 101.8 yards a game. Containing Saquon Barkley has to be priority No. 1 for Kansas City in Super Bowl LIX. It will fall to Bolton and Tranquill to do that. Advantage:Chiefs  This is another tough call. Both the Eagles and Chiefs were solid against the pass. Each allowed less than 220 passing yards per game in the regular season. But the Eagles topped the league at 174.2 yards per game—a remarkable turnaround after ranking near the bottom of the NFL against the pass in 2023. The engine for that turnaround was the 2024 draft and the selection of Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell and Iowa's Cooper DeJean with Philly's first two draft picks. DeJean has already blossomed into one of the better slot defenders in the game. Mitchell didn't have an interception in the regular season but has picked up a pair in the postseason. A legitimate argument can be made that among the top three corners in Philly, the weak link is veteran Darius Slay—who has six Pro Bowl nods over a dozen seasons in the league. The Chiefs, on the other hand, may have the best corner of the lot. In three seasons, Trent McDuffie has become a legitimate \"shutdown\" corner—hispasser rating againstin 2024 was 82.9, and McDuffie barely allowed 10 yards a reception in the regular season. This position could well be the one that decides Super Bowl LIX. Can DeJean keep Travis Kelce in check? Can Mitchell stop fellow rookie Xavier Worthy from getting behind the defense for a long one? Can McDuffie play on an island and allow Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo to give help to the likes of Jaylen Watson or Nazeeh Johnson against A.J. Brown or DeVonta Smith? The answers to those questions could determine who gets a confetti bath at the end of Super Bowl LIX. But the early edge belongs to Philadelphia. Advantage:Eagles  There are no household names at safety for the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. When teams are paying quarterbacks $50 million a season and other positions big bucks, costs gotta get cut somewhere. That's not to say that there isn't some talent at the back end of these defenses. But there are question marks as well. For the Eagles, Reed Blankenship is a tenacious player who has quietly posted apasser rating against of 72.5this season. But he's not the fleetest of foot or a particularly big safety. Meanwhile, in Justin Reid the Chiefs have a ferocious hitter who knows the scheme in Kansas City as well as anyone in the secondary. But he's not great in coverage—Reid'spasser rating against of 108.4in coverage in 2024 was the second-highest number of his seven-year career. Bryan Cook was fourth on the Chiefs with 78 tackles in the regular season, but he's an average talent on a good day. The wild card here? The player who tips the scales and could make a real difference in the game? Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson picked off six passes in the regular season for the second time in three seasons. However, while Gardner-Johnson has racked up big plays, he has also been victimized by opposing quarterbacks with regularity. The 27-year-oldwas creditedwith 23 completions allowed in 2024. Eight went for touchdowns. Frankly, this is a coin-flip, but Gardner-Johnson's propensity for the sort of play that can swing a Super Bowl gets the Eagles yet another edge in Super Bowl LIX. Advantage:Eagles  Kickers are people too...allegedly. And if the game comes down to a last-second kick, the two-time defending champions have a decided edge. It's been something of a rough season for Philadelphia's Jake Elliotte. He has missed eight kicks and has a success percentage in 2024 of less than 80 percent. Elliott has just flat-out been bad from long distance—one field goal over 50 yards in the regular season in seven attempts. Harrison Butker of the Chiefs hasn't exactly lit the world on fire, as he missed a month and had a success rate under 85 percent for the regular season. But the 29-year-old has played his part in the Chiefs dynasty. Per Sunday's AFC Championship Game broadcast, Butker has never missed a field goal in the fourth quarter or overtime of a postseason game. The punters are a wash. Philly's Braden Mann and Kansas City's Matt Araiza have nearly identical net averages and percentages of kicks inside the 20. Six of one, half a dozen of the other. It's difficult to assess the return games, in part because this is the Super Bowl—if ever there was a time to pull out a wrinkle in that regard or run a trick play, this is it. But it's worth noting that Chiefs running back Samaje Perine didn't have a kick return under 20 yards in the regular season and peeled off a 56-yarder. Eagles running back Kenneth Gainwell enjoyed similar success—he averaged 25.3 yards per return in 2024. Expect to see a lot of touchbacks on February 9. Advantage:Chiefs",

PerConnor Hughesof SNY, Glenn acknowledged that the process of turning the franchise around won't be easy before adding, \"But we're the freaking New York Jets, and we're built for this s--t.\" \"We're the freaking New York Jets. And we're built for this s--t.\"<br><br>- Aaron Glenn <a href=\"https://t.co/5zCDhfebU1\">pic.twitter.com/5zCDhfebU1</a> A former NFL cornerback, Glenn was the Jets' first-round pick in the 1994 NFL draft and spent the first eight years of his playing career with the franchise. New York also gave him his first off-the-field job as a personnel scout in 2012, so being hired as head coach represents a full-circle moment for him. However, taking over the Jets is no small task, as Glenn is now at the helm of a team that has the league's longest active playoff drought at 14 straight years. New York has significant decisions to make this offseason, such as whether to retain star quarterback Aaron Rodgers if he chooses to continue his playing career. Glenn and newly hired general manager Darren Mougey will have to be in lockstep as they try to end New York's run of futility, but they both made it clear on Monday that they're ready for the challenge. Luckily for Glenn, he already has extensive experience in turning losing franchises into title contenders. As a player, he endured a 1-15 season with the Jets in 1996 before the team finished 12-4 just two years later. When he was hired as defensive coordinator of the Detroit Lions in 2021 under head coach Dan Campbell, the team went 3-13-1 in his first year before putting together three straight winning seasons with back-to-back NFC North titles in the past two years. By the end of Monday's press conference, it was clear that Glenn displayed the energy and leadership the Jets will need in order to turn things around quickly and return to playoff contention.",

        "source": "https://www.bleacherreport.com/",
        "content": " Las Vegas Raiders head coach Pete Carroll knows his top priority with his new team is to find a franchise quarterback, and he plans to take advantage of the best resource available to him. During his introductory press conference on Monday, Carrolltold reportersthat the Raiders are \"going to lean on\" part-owner Tom Brady \"as much as we possibly can for his insights\" in the search for a quarterback of the future. The Raiders went 4-13 in 2024 while rotating between quarterbacks Gardner Minshew, Aidan O'Connell and Desmond Ridder. Las Vegas will have the No. 6 pick in the 2025 NFL draft, so there's a chance it could miss out on top quarterback prospects like Shedeur Sanders and Cam Ward if it doesn't trade up. Carrollexplained to reportersthat he wouldn't pass up on the opportunity to figure out the quarterback position with Brady, who secured a five-percent ownership stake in the Raiders in October. \"It's our mission to build this football team up around the quarterback position. This isn't the only spot,\" Carroll said. \"We happen to have the greatest of all time to help us, and to see clearly, and we're going to lean on Tom as much as we possibly can for his insights because nobody has the insights that he has. He's that unique.\" Brady also works as Fox's lead NFL analyst.Albert BreerofSports Illustratedreported on Monday that the 47-year-oldhad some influencein the Raiders' hiring of Carroll, but he added that \"he won't have a day-to-day presence in the organization, at least in the beginning\" because his family still resides in Florida. Still, Carroll said it would be a mistake to not pick Brady's brain, as the seven-time Super Bowl champion is one of the best quarterbacks to ever play football. \"Coach [Bill] Walsh taught me a long time ago that it's the hardest position in professional sports to play, so we need to make it as easy as possible. And we'll go about doing that by running the football, protecting him, taking care of the ball, playing great defense, and kicking the football when we want to kick it,\" Carrollsaid. \"So, there's a lot that goes into this. But to think about how fortunate we are to have Tom Brady with us — it's just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"",

        "content": " The latest chapter of the ongoing saga between the Miami Heat and star forward Jimmy Butler has reached a new low. The Heatannouncedthat they are suspending Butler indefinitely for no fewer than five games. \"The suspension is due to a continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services,\" the teamstated. \"This includes walking out of practice earlier today.\" ESPN'sShams Charaniareported that Butler walked out of Monday morning's shootaround after being told he was being replaced in the starting lineup by Haywood Highsmith. ESPN's Bobby Marks explained that Butler will be taking a major financial hit based on Miami's designation for his suspension: Failure to render services: $532,737 per game <br><br>Conduct detrimental to the team: $336,543 per game <a href=\"https://t.co/H1dx97otp7\">https://t.co/H1dx97otp7</a> Butlerwas expectedto make his return from a two-game suspension in Monday's game against the Orlando Magic. This marks the third time this month alone that the Heat resorted to suspending him, as he also served a seven-game suspension earlier in January. The 35-year-old has made it clear that he wants to be traded from Miami before the Feb. 6 deadline. However, finding a suitor has proved difficult thanks to his hefty$48.8 million salaryfor this season as well as his intentions to test free agency at the end of the year. Butler has also done little to make himself an attractive trade target amid his rift with the Heat. In 25 games this season, Butler has averaged just 17.0 points, his lowest mark since his third season in the NBA in 2013-14. The Heat deemed his conduct to be detrimental to the team when they levied the first suspension, and theysaidhis second suspension was for \"insubordinate conduct and conduct detrimental to the team, including missing\" a team flight to Milwaukee for a game against the Bucks. With Butler in and out of the lineup, Miami ranks eighth in the Eastern Conference with a 22-22 record. Shooting guard Tyler Herro has emerged as the team's primary option and leads the Heat with 24.0 points and 5.2 assists per game. Miami has just a few days left before the 2025 trade deadline, but it's clear that there's no future for Butler in South Beach.",

Other potential future teammates, based on her list of schools still in the running for her commitment, include Knox (No. 11 recruit in the nation, LSU) and McDowell (No. 27, South Carolina). If Chavez isn't committed by the game, her partnership with Betts in particular will be a major point of interest. She'llalso be joiningBetts and Knox at USA Basketball's 26th Nike Hoop Summit on April 12 against the World Team's under-19 international roster. Landing both players would be a coup for UCLA, which is currently the top-ranked team in the nation and a perfect 20-0.

        "title": "Jerry: Schotty Hire Is Big Risk",
        "source": "https://www.bleacherreport.com/",
        "content": " Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones acknowledged he ventured off the beaten path a bit when he tabbed Brian Schottenheimer as the team's next head coach. \"This is as big a risk you could take,\" Jonestold reportersMonday during Schottenheimer's introductory press conference. \"No head coaching experience. But he's had 25 years of experience.\" The owner also believes being the son of a legendary NFL coach has aided Schottenheimer in his coaching career: Owner Jerry Jones references Brian Schottenheimer's \"osmosis\" about growing up with his father Marty, a multiple-time NFL head coach, and he speaks to experiencing Schotty in Cowboys coaches meetings as reasons for hiring him to be the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DallasCowboys?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DallasCowboys</a> head coach <a href=\"https://t.co/ZgJKUZCM1Q\">pic.twitter.com/ZgJKUZCM1Q</a> Hiring Schottenheimer has been met with a lot of skepticism, to put it kindly. The 51-year-old boasts a lot of experience, having started his coaching career in 1997. But, as Jones noted, he hasn't been a head coach before and his performanceas an offensive coordinatordoesn't blow you away. Monday's press conference was an opportunity for Jones to lay out a clear vision for why he was won over by Schottenheimer's pitch despite the obvious question marks. Instead, the 82-year-old probably just confirmed the worst fears of fans who believe the Cowboys' Super Bowl drought will extend indefinitely. RJ Ochoa of Blogging the Boys transcribed a portion of the press conference when Jones received a question about Schottenheimer and proceeded to talk up his own résumé. Jerry Jones on hiring Brian Schottenheimer:<br><br>*long pause*<br><br>\"In the almost 35 years that I've been involved with the Dallas Cowboys... I've only missed one Senior Bowl. 35 years. And I think I missed one Combine, in 35 years. At the NFL, over the last 4 or 5 years, the NFL we want… Taking a risk isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially after Dallas opted for a relatively safe hire when it chose Mike McCarthy in 2020. Firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson was an even bigger gamble and look how that worked out. But Schottenheimer feels like an NFL coaching retread without him having worked in this job before. Surely another team would've made him a head coach by now if he gave the impression he was suited for the role. The idea that having a famous coaching father helps isn't really backed up by history, either. Don Shula is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. He had two sons, Dave and Mike, who followed in his footsteps, and neither has enjoyed a distinguished career. Rex Ryan, Wade Phillips and Jim Mora Jr. all had fathers who were NFL coaches and none excelled for an extended period of time, either. San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan is the exception rather than the norm. If this all works, then Jones will look like a genius. The last 30 years of the Cowboys' history points to a much different outcome with the Schottenheimer experiment.",

        "content": " The 2025 NFL Conference Championship Round featured an NFC East battle and a dynasty trying to crush the hopes of a familiar playoff foe. In the NFC title game, the Philadelphia Eagles offense had its best scoring output of the season, outscoring the Washington Commanders 55-23. The Commanders didn't have an answer for the Eagles' ground attack, giving up 232 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels led his team in a respectable battle early, but Washington turned the ball over four times, and the Eagles converted all those giveaways into touchdown drives. Philadelphia will advance to the Super Bowl for the third time in seven years. The Kansas City Chiefs outlasted the Buffalo Bills 32-29 in a much more competitive AFC Championship Game. Sunday's nightcap sends Kansas City to a third straight Super Bowl while sending Buffalo into the offseason searching for a way to finally get past its postseason nemesis. Bleacher Report analysts Kris Knox and Maurice Moton will break down the aftermath of the NFC and AFC Championship Games.  NFL fans should get used to watching the Washington Commanders in playoff games in the coming years. Their deep run to the NFC Championship Game isn't a fluke. We often hear, \"They will be back,\" about many teams that lose in the Conference Championship Round or in the Super Bowl, but the Commanders are just getting started with their new regime. Washington has a foundation that starts with its quarterback and head coach. The Commanders won 12 games this season, the most since their Super Bowl run in the 1991 campaign. Head coach Dan Quinn has led two clubs to NFC title games, and his teams have a 54 percent winning percentage. Jayden Daniels should be the 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year. He finished the season within the top 10 in passing touchdowns (25) and QBR (77.3). Now, the front office can build on the team's foundation in free agency and the draft. The Commanders have$87.6 million in cap spaceand three selections with the top 80 draft picks. Skeptics may be hesitant to believe that Washington's Super Bowl window has opened so quickly, but Daniels' poise and playmaking ability in clutch moments give this team a chance at winning a title in the near future. Sure, 2023 Offensive Player of the Year C.J. Stroud regressed this past season, a cautionary case to consider when praising Daniels. However, unlike Stroud, Daniels led his team to multiple road playoff victories, slaying the No. 1 seed in the NFC en route to the Conference Championship Game. Furthermore, Daniels has a more proven play-caller in Kliff Kingsbury than Stroud had in former Texans offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik. If Kingsbury remains in Washington, the Commanders can see significant growth in their offense with the addition of another wide receiver as Quinn and coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. continue to coach up the defense.  The Philadelphia Eagles offense can step on the field in New Orleans and tell opposing defenders to pick their poison. On Sunday, the Eagles attacked the Washington Commanders in a variety of ways. On Philadelphia's first offensive play from scrimmage, Saquon Barkley ran for a 60-yard touchdown. He tacked on another score within four yards of the goal line in the opening quarter. Quarterback Jalen Hurts didn't seem hampered by a knee injury that forced him to wear a brace. The Eagles ran the \"Tush Push\" play multiple times in short-yardage situations, and he rushed for three touchdowns. Hurts also threw for 246 yards and a score. Hurts' connection with wideout A.J. Brown is noteworthy, though. In the Eagles' first two playoff contests, Brown only caught three passes for 24 yards, and much was made about him reading Jim Murphy's book \"Inner Excellence\" while sitting on the bench in the team's wild-card matchup with the Green Bay Packers. Fully engaged against the Commanders, he hauled in six passes for 96 yards and a touchdown. Tight end Dallas Goedert caught a team-high seven passes for 85 yards. Backup running backs Will Shipley and Kenneth Gainwell racked up 101 scrimmage yards combined, spelling Barkley, who needed breaks totake care of a calf issue. Philadelphia's offense ranked seventh in scoring and eighth in total yards for the regular season—a high-end unit but not quite an explosive juggernaut. Now operating at its peak, the Eagles offense can outpace its next opponent, even if the defense doesn't force multiple turnovers. After a 55-point scoring outburst in the NFC Championship Game, the Eagles offense has left its nest and could fly high in Super Bowl LIX.  No NFL team has ever won three consecutive Super Bowls. The Chiefs will have an opportunity to do exactly that when they face the Eagles in two weeks. Sunday's win over the Bills wasn't an easy one, but the Chiefs did avenge their only meaningful regular-season loss. They did so by making key plays at critical times on both sides of the ball. This is essentially how Kansas City has operated all year. For this team, winning close games has become routine—it has now won 17 straight one-score games. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo's unit did have some trouble corralling Josh Allen and the Bills, who tallied 374 yards and 29 points. However, a pair of 4th-down stops in the fourth quarter gave the Chiefs a chance to end the game with the ball in their hands. The Chiefs make the stop on fourth down!<br><br>📺: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BUFvsKC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BUFvsKC</a> on CBS<br>📱: Stream on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFLPlus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NFLPlus</a> and Paramount+ <a href=\"https://t.co/s4rXNURB3z\">pic.twitter.com/s4rXNURB3z</a> Kansas City did exactly that, with running backs Isiah Pacheco and Samaje Perine each picking up first-down receptions to close out the game. It was a fitting way for Kansas City's offense to end the game. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes regularly turned to his secondary targets a week after leaning heavily on star tight end Travis Kelce. Kelce had seven catches for 117 yards and a touchdown against the Houston Texans in the divisional round. Buffalo did a great job of limiting him to two catches and 19 yards, but that opened the door for Xavier Worthy (6 catches, 85 yards, 1 TD) and JuJu Smith-Schuster (2 catches 60 yards) to make big plays in the passing game. Of course, it helps to have Mahomes, who remains the biggest reason why a Super Bowl trifecta is even possible. He was mostly efficient through the air and lethal with his legs on Sunday, finishing with 245 passing yards, 43 rushing yards and three combined touchdowns. MAHOMES GIVES THE CHIEFS THE LEAD ON HIS SECOND RUSHING TD OF THE DAY 😲<br><br>(via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NFL</a>)<a href=\"https://t.co/dqJqAAb6BB\">pic.twitter.com/dqJqAAb6BB</a> Yet, the Chiefs' effort to build a dynamic offense that complements their fourth-ranked scoring defense—and do so throughout the season—is impressive. Worthy is a rookie, while Smith-Schuster, Kareem Hunt and DeAndre Hopkins were all added after the end of the preseason. After two consecutive Super Bowl wins, the Chiefs could have become complacent. Instead, they've adapted, evolved and set themselves up for a shot at history.  Falling short in the conference title round always hurts. It has to be particularly painful for the Bills, who just can't seem to get past Kansas City in the postseason. Buffalo has reached the playoffs in six straight seasons. Four of those runs have been ended by the Chiefs. Most of the playoff battles with Kansas City have been close. This one felt a bit different, however, because this Bills team felt different. After years of Allen playing hero ball and often costing his team by trying to do too much, a new approach yielded more efficiency. Offensive coordinator Joe Brady concocted an offense that didn't depend on one or two primary targets. Allen did an excellent job all year of finding the open target while minimizing risks and allowing running backs James Cook and Ty Johnson to carry plenty of the load themselves. After throwing double-digit interceptions in each of the past four seasons, Allen threw just six in 2024. He didn't have a turnover against Kansas City either and helped deliver 29 points against one of the better defenses in the NFL. Offensively, the Bills may have found their formula—though they have offseason decisions to make regarding impending free agents like Johnson, Mack Hollins and Amari Cooper. However, Buffalo needs to find a way to bring its defense up to par. The Bills couldn't do enough to corral Mahomes and Kansas City's offense. That last failed fourth-down attempt will linger in the minds of Bills fans, but the defense did have chances to get the ball back at the end of the game. It didn't. Samaje Perine picks up clutch the first down!<br><br>📺: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BUFvsKC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BUFvsKC</a> on CBS<br>📱: Stream on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFLPlus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NFLPlus</a> and Paramount+ <a href=\"https://t.co/s8PD07o4ux\">pic.twitter.com/s8PD07o4ux</a> If the Bills are going to figure out how to get past Kansas City in the most important games, they have to improve a defense that ranked 19th in yards per carry allowed and 17th in net yards per pass attempt allowed in the regular season. Doing so while facing a projected$2.5 millioncap deficit won't be easy. A decision on 35-year-old pass-rusher Von Miller likely looms, as releasing him with a post-June 1 designation would save$17.4 million. The good news is that Buffalo is close to getting to where it wants to be. Paring the offense we saw in 2024 with a top-10 defense—which the Bills had in 2023—might be enough to get this team into the Super Bowl next season.",

        "source": "https://www.bleacherreport.com/",
        "content": " The 2025 NBA trade deadline is officially next week, meaning teams are running out of time to improve their rosters or chances at the No. 1 pick in a loaded draft. All eyes remain on Jimmy Butler, although there's a number of other veterans who could be moved by Thursday as well. We could finally see one NBA champion traded after 12 years with his current franchise, one recently traded three-time All-Star already on the move again and another team desperate to undo its mistakes from this past summer. With just over a week to go, don't be surprised if these bold trade deadline predictions come true.  Khris Middleton has been a staple of the Milwaukee Bucks' success for the past 12 seasons, making three All-Star Games and helping the franchise win the 2021 NBA championship. Now at age 33 and battling injuries in recent years, the Bucks could use Middleton and his hefty salary to help execute a big trade at the deadline. Middleton is making $31.7 million this season (the most of any player outside of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard) and has aplayer option for $34 millionnext season that he'll almost certainly pick up. While he's become a good rotation player off the bench for the Bucks with his scoring and playmaking ability, Middleton is no longer capable of being the third-best player on a championship team. Since the Bucks are a second-apron team, they may be limited in only taking in players making the same or less than Middleton's $31.7 million contract this season. However, if Milwaukee wanted to pursue a star like Jimmy Butler making over that, they technically could if the trade involved the Bucks sending out enough salary to get them under the second apron (currently$6.5 million above, h/t NBA cap expertYossi Gozlan). No matter if the Bucks pursue a blockbuster trade that would land them Butler or settle for a smaller target like Jerami Grant of the Portland Trail Blazers or Cameron Johnson of the Brooklyn Nets, Middleton will likely be the player sacrificed in the deal to make the money work. One of the greatest players in franchise history, Middleton's time in Milwaukee is almost done.  After finishing just a game out of first place in the Western Conference last season, the Minnesota Timberwolves find themselves 13.5 games back of the Oklahoma City Thunder, now fighting for a spot in the West play-in tournament. The Julius Randle-Karl-Anthony Towns swap hasn't looked good to this point (although it may have been necessary financially), with Randle's swing rating (minus-0.1, 50th percentile viaCleaning the Glass) not resembling that of a No. 2 option on a team trying to win a title. Randle's raw numbers have been fine (18.9 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists a game), although the Wolves' starting lineup with him has been remarkably average (plus-1.8 net rating). With Randle potentially becoming a free agent this summer ($30.9 million player option), Minnesota may need to see what it can get for the 30-year-old now before committing big money to him or watching him leave for nothing. The Wolves can shop Randle and his$33.1 million essentially expiring contractnow while using the first-round pick acquired from the Knicks (2025 first-rounder via Detroit Pistons, top-13 protected) to bring in a better-fitting power forward or scoring wing to help Anthony Edwards shoulder the offensive load. Randle is still a good player and can help a lot of teams as a starting power forward, although he no longer looks the part of a No. 2 option now in his 30s. Expect the Wolves to trade their three-time All-Star.  Despite a career blemished by injuries, Zion Williamson has largely stayed out of trade talks by the New Orleans Pelicans because of his immense talent level. Now currently healthy, it's time for the Pels to shop their All-Star forward. Williamson has played just 10 games this season, yet has looked good in his recent return from a hamstring injury. The 24-year-old forward has averaged 20.8 points, 8.5 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.3 blocks in just 25.6 minutes over four games in his return, shooting 53.8 percent overall. The Pelicans also improve by a whopping 16.2 points per 100 possessions (99th percentile, viaCleaning the Glass) with Williamson on the floor. This is precisely why New Orleans needs to discuss Williamson trades now while he's active. This organization has been far too reliant on his shaky health, going a solid103-91 in Williamson's gamessince he was selected No. 1 overall in 2019, yet they have fallen to just 97-143 in contests he misses. Organizations like the Oklahoma City Thunder, Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Clippers and others have shown the ability to continue to win despite missing key pieces this season. This Pelicans team has yet to display the same resolve throughout Williamson's career. It's time the Pels seriously start shopping Williamson, a move that would no longer hold the organization captive and potentially open up future cap space with which to re-sign Brandon Ingram.  Two of the teams that definitelyneedto do something at the trade deadline, the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers will be disappointingly silent. Both franchises have made smaller moves to date, with the Warriors trading for Dennis Schröder and the Lakers swapping D'Angelo Russell and some second-rounders for Dorian Finney-Smith. Neither trade has moved the needle, however, as Golden State has gone just 8-11 with Schröder while Los Angeles is 4-5 when Finney-Smith plays. A big move for both franchises is needed to get back into championship contention. Neither fanbase should hold their breath, however. Rob Pelinka and the Lakers have been very protective of their future first-round picks and still have possession of their 2029 and 2031 first-rounders. Los Angeles has enough assets to land a third star, yet has long seemed more interested in holding on to future picks instead of maximizing the remaining few years of the greatest basketball player in history. Both LeBron James and Anthony Davis have stated that the team has to play perfect basketball in order to win with the current roster, with Davis publicly declaring his desire for the team to trade for a center, per ESPN'sShams Charania. Stephen Curry has stated that he doesn't want the Warriorsto make a desperate tradethat would deplete the future, although Golden State has six first-round picks they can outright trade or agree to swap, with only a 2030 first-rounder (top-20 protected)owed to the Washington Wizards. With players like Jimmy Butler, Brandon Ingram, Zach LaVine, Cameron Johnson, CJ McCollum, Jerami Grant and others available and All-Stars like LaMelo Ball and Zion Williamson facing questionable futures with their teams, big moves can be found that would really elevate both the Lakers and Warriors. In the end, nothing will materialize, leaving James, Curry and others fighting just to make the playoffs.  It shouldcome as no surprisethat the four-year, $211.5 million max contract that Paul George signed last offseason with the Philadelphia 76ers already isn't looking good. What if I told you that George's megadeal at age 34 wasn't the worst move of the Sixers' offseason, however? In late September, Philly inked Joel Embiid, who was already under contract for two more years (plus a player option), to a new three-year, $192.9 million extension. This brought his total contract to nearly$300 million over the next five years, ending in a $69 million player option during the 2028-29 season when Embiid will turn 35. The Sixers likely did this to avoid a Jimmy Butler-Miami Heat situation, although it was both unnecessary and extremely risky given Embiid's durability issues. At 15-27 this season and having lost seven straight games with Embiid once again sidelined, the 76ers need to shift the franchise mindset to building around Tyrese Maxey and Jared McCain while testing the market for players like George and Embiid. George is eligible to be traded at any time (although a return for him won't be great) whereas Embiidcan't be moved until this summersince he signed his extension less than six months ago. Don't be surprised to hear whispers of the 76ers gauging the market for their veteran stars as early as this trade deadline.",

        "content": "Several Border Patrol agents conducting surveillance and enforcement activities in Texas came under fire from suspected Mexican drug cartel operatives early Monday afternoon. Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents exchanged gunfire with the cartel members and sought cover as reinforcements were summoned. The agents did not sustain injuries during the initial exchange of gunfire. However, the incident is still unfolding. UPDATE: 9:15 p.m. 01/27/25:DPS officials report that state law enforcement resources have withdrawn from the scene. Mexican sources also report that Army and State Guard troops withdrew from the south side of the river. Officials indicate no arrests have been made. Border Patrol officials had no comment regarding their current status on the matter. UPDATE: 8:45 p.m. 01/27/25:Photos provided by Texas DPS show heavily armed Mexican Army trucks patrol the south side of the Rio Grande. Mexican Army units patrol the south bank of the Rio Grande near the island where shots were fired at Border Patrol agents. (Texas Department of Public Safety) UPDATE: 8:15 p.m. 01/27/25:Border Patrol Tactical (BORTAC) teams arrived at the scene to help recover three Border Patrol vehicles abandoned by agents who came under fire, according to DPS Lt. Olivarez. Video posted by Jorge Ventura Media shows the BORTAC teams arriving. Olivarez told Breitbart Texas four cartel gunmen were hiding on the 100+ acre brush-covered island. The island is located in the middle of the Rio Grande not far fromFronton Island, the island that was cleared of brush in November 2023 by the Texas National Guard. UPDATE: 6:00 p.m. 01/27/25:Texas DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez told Breitbart Texas that four alleged gunmen are still pinned down on an island in the Rio Grande. The men are being monitored by DPS drones. The men reportedly pointed rifles at the drones. ORIGINAL STORY CONTINUES: According to a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), the agents were conducting surveillance along the Rio Grande near Fronton, Texas, when the shooting took place. The agents returned gunfire and sought cover in the heavy brush along the river’s edge. The agents left their marked Border Patrol vehicles on the banks of the river, where they currently remain as the shooting scene remains active. According to the DPS spokesperson, Lieutenant Chris Olivarez, Texas authorities are assisting Special Operations Group members from the Border Patrol who are currently at the scene. Several law enforcement drones are being utilized to observe the movements of the drug cartel members as the agent’s vehicles are retrieved from the banks of the Rio Grande. Law enforcement sources on the scene tell Breitbart Texas the authorities have four suspected cartel members trapped on an island just off the Mexican bank of the Rio Grande and are monitoring that activity. Asreportedby Breitbart Texas, the Fronton, Texas area has been notoriously dangerous for Border Patrol agents and Texas DPS Highway Patrol troopers in recent years due to Mexican drug cartel activity. In January 2022, Border Patrol agents attempting to arrest a migrant near Fronton came under gunfire but escaped injury in that incident as well. A Border Patrol vehicle sustained damage from the gunfire during that incident. The latest shooting comes just days after aBorder Patrol agent was killed during a shootout in Vermont. The Border Patrol agent, identified by officials as David C. Maland, conducted a traffic stop on a Vermont highway near the Canadian border. Few details of the shooting have been released by the FBI or U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol as an investigation continues. Newly appointed Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks confirmed Agent Maland was killed by gunfire last week. Immediately after being sworn in, President Trump signed an executive order designating the Mexican Drug Cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.

        "content": "Trump’s Tariff Gambit: Colombia Learns Who Holds the Cards President Trump’s tariff threat against Colombia demonstrated the power of economic leverage wielded with precision. By announcing tariffs of 25 percent—escalating to a potential 50 percent—Trump compelled Colombian President Gustavo Petro to reverse his defiant stanceand agree to accept deported migrants. The episode was not a mere diplomatic spat but a vivid illustration of America’s unmatched influence when it chooses to act decisively. Trump’s detractors were quick to predict dire consequences, conjuring images ofsky-high flower prices before Valentine’s Dayand an impending coffee crisis. Instead, the Colombian government swiftly capitulated, underscoring the inherent imbalance in the U.S.-Colombia relationship and proving the effectiveness of Trump’s strategy. The numbers tell the story: the U.S. is not merely Colombia’s largest trading partner but its economic lifeline. In contrast,Colombia occupies a marginal place in America’s broader trade picture. When the U.S. asserts itself, the outcome is rarely in doubt. The trade dynamic between the United States and Colombia is stark. In 2023, the U.S. imported $16.1 billion of Colombian goods, constituting 28 percent of Colombia’s total exports and5.6 percent of its GDP. In contrast, U.S. exports to Colombia, while significant at $17.7 billion, amounted to just 0.07 percent of America’s $26.9 trillion GDP. This disparity leaves Colombia economically dependent on American demand, while a trade disruption would barely register in the U.S. economy. Colombia’s key exports—oil, coffee, bananas, and flowers—are all heavily reliant on U.S. consumers. The flower industry, in particular, illustrates this dependence: Colombian growers supply 80 percent of the cut flowers sold in the U.S., withValentine’s Day alone accounting for a significant share of annual sales. This period is as critical to Colombia’s flower sector as the holiday shopping season is to U.S. retailers. The timing of Trump’s tariff threat, ahead of this peak demand, magnified its impact. For Colombia,a trade war would have devastated key industries, causing widespread economic dislocation. For the U.S., the loss of Colombian trade would have been a minor inconvenience at most. Trump’s swift and confident use of this asymmetry turned the tide decisively in America’s favor. Faced with the threat of tariffs and visa sanctions, Petro initially attempted to framethe issue as one of Colombian sovereignty. Yet it took only hours for reality to set in. The prospect of economic ruin forced his government to reverse course, agreeing to accept deportation flights on Trump’s terms. Colombian President Gustavo Petro speaks in Bogota, Colombia, on November 7, 2024. (RAUL ARBOLEDA/AFP via Getty Images) This was no drawn-out negotiation or symbolic gesture. It was results-driven policymaking, executed with clarity and purpose. Trump’s actions revealed the fragility of Colombia’s position andthe power of American economic dominance, proving that tariff threats are a formidable tool when used judiciously. This episode transcends U.S.-Colombia relations. It is a lesson to the world about thestrategic use of tariffs as a tool of statecraft. Access to the American market is not an entitlement; it is a privilege contingent on respect for U.S. priorities. Nations with significant trade surpluses or deep economic reliance on the U.S. would be wise to take note: under Trump’s leadership, American interests will not be compromised for fear of confrontation. For U.S. businesses and investors, this should inspire confidence. When Trump threatens tariffs in response to foreign actions that undermine American policy, the result is likely to be a recalibration of behavior by trading partners—not an escalation into damaging trade wars. Trump’s handling of this standoff was about more than immigration enforcement. It was a declaration thatAmerica’s sovereignty is not up for debate. The administration’s efforts to restore order at the border and uphold the rule of law are reinforced by actions like these, which send a clear message to both allies and adversaries: the United States will act decisively to protect its interests. Our immigration policy will be made in the U.S. and not in the capitals of foreign nations. Within Colombia,Petro’s reversal was a stark acknowledgment of his miscalculation. The dispute was one he could not win, and the rapid resolution left no doubt about the balance of power. By leveraging the U.S.’s unparalleled economic influence, Trump achieved an outcome that strengthened American sovereignty, upheld border security, showed the world that we will not be pushed around, and affirmed the nation’s role as a global power. For Colombia, the alternative—a prolonged trade conflict—would have been disastrous. For the United States, it would have been inconsequential. This episode is a reminder thatwhen America acts with clarity and conviction, its strength is not only undeniable but unassailable. Pleaselet us knowif you're having issues with commenting.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "CBS’Elsbethstar Wendell Pierce jumped to his X account to attack Donald Trump for fulfilling his pledge to begin deporting criminal illegal aliens and called Trump’s policy a “racist purge” of the black and Latino community and called Trump’s supporters “white supremicist [sic] and neo Nazis.” Pierce, who constantly posts far-left screeds on social media, attacked Trump for doing exactly what he promised to do once elected. “The mass deportation of illegal immigrants is a racist purge of the Latino and Black communities. Notice no raids of the Russian community in Brighton Beach or the Irish community of Boston, where known undocumented immigrants regularly live. No European immigrant communities raided,” theSuitsstar said. Pierce then insisted that both Obama and Biden deported more illegal aliens than Trump has and claimed that those presidents “enforced our immigration laws better than President Trump,” despite the fact that more illegals poured through the wide-open southern border during Obama and Biden’s years than during Trump’s first term. Of course, Pierce doesn’t mention that the reason Biden was able to deport more is because he allowed many millions more to pour across the border than did Trump. The truth is, Biden had far more illegals available to deport. Further, Biden was able to use Trump’s Title 42 expulsion rules for much longer than Trump to prevent certain illegals from staying here. Pierce then went on to scoff, “These raids are performative to capture the attention of his base.” The actor next accused Trump’s voters of being inveterate racists. “But we must remember his base is supported by white supremicist [sic] and neo Nazis. They marched in triumph in DC this weekend. The executive orders to dismantle the civil rights protections in government is to satisfy that part of his base. Ending OSDBU (offices of small disadvantaged business utilization) in all government departments ends decades of discrimination protections,” theSuitscast member railed. Pierce continued into a longer spittle-specked rage and accused Trump of trying to eliminate “racial equality” and to cancel the 1965 Voting Rights bill, among other wild-eyed accusations. This is an organized effort to eliminate all progress made in racial equality and centuries of progress. The birthright citizenship in the 14th amendment ensured newly freed slaves their rights as citizens in 1865. Now Trump wants to eliminate that. This is an organized effort to destroy the 1965 Voting Rights bill. They have already eliminated section 4 that protected us from poll taxes and other tricks of voter suppression. Now they’re eliminating efforts to include minority contracts in government. A business partner of mine lost his contract with the stroke of a pen this week. President Trump has halted ALL civil rights discrimination investigations in the department of justice. The police reform has been stopped as law enforcement has been given blanket immunity. Ironic as those criminals who attacked police on January 6 were pardoned. Political violence is now normalized. Pierce closed by making a thinly veiled call to organized violence against Donald Trump and the federal government. There are those who do not have our best interest at heart. The Black community has now been called to exercise its right of self determination and protection. From the beginning of this country there is an effort to marginalize and obstruct our participation in the American aesthetic. This is a call to action to protect our rights and practice radical self care. There is blood on that ballot box. Many have died to guarantee our rights. We must fight as President Trump destroys them. Pierce frequently goes off on fact-free rants accusing white people of being irredeemably racist and, like many in Hollywood who dutifully toe the leftist line, has repeatedlytargetedDonald Trump andRepublicansto accuse them of being “racists.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at:facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social@WarnerToddHuston Pleaselet us knowif you're having issues with commenting.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) hot take on how tariffs on Colombian goods may lead to higher coffee prices for Americans left a burnt and bitter aftertaste for many on social media. President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro were at loggerheads when the leader of the South American country would not accept flights of deported Colombian migrants from America. In reaction to this Trump swiftly announced emergency 25 percent tariffs on goods coming into the United States from Colombia. The presidentsaid, “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!” On Sunday, the New York progressive said that Americans would pay the price for Trump’s proposed tariffs. “To ‘punish’ Colombia, Trump is about to make every American pay even more for coffee. Remember: WE pay the tariffs, not Colombia,” shewroteon X. “Trump is all about making inflation WORSE for working class Americans, not better. He’s lining the pockets of himself and the billionaire class,” Ocasio-Cortez added. Despite Ocasio-Cortez’s claim, the importer, in this case the Colombian coffee company, would pay the price of the tariff to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Breitbart News economics editor John Carney has frequentlyfact-checkedthe core of Ocasio-Cortez’s claim, that the cost of a tariff is inevitably paid by the consumer and not the businesses that import foreign goods: While critics of tariffs frequently claim that importers will pass the cost of tariffs on to consumers, there is little evidence to support that view. When Trump imposed tariffs on goods from China and on imported steel and aluminum, the prices of consumer goods did not rise. Typically, when a large economy imposes tariffs, the exporters reduce their prices to stay competitive and defend their market share. As a result, much of the cost of the tariff is borne by the exporters rather than consumers. To the extent that tariffs are not paid for by exporters, they tend to be absorbed by the importing merchants rather than consumers. Tariffs are certainly not a national sales tax because they only apply to imported goods, which make up a small portion of the goods and services purchased by U.S. consumers. TheNew York Postalso noted that many countries other than Colombia, such as Vietnam and Brazil, also export coffee. California State Assembly Rep.

        "content": "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on Monday issued a memo with guidance for returning federal workers to work after President Donald Trump took executive action, ordering heads of departments and agencies to require employees to go back to work in person. Trumptookthe executive action on his first day in office, directing “heads of all departments and agencies in the executive branch of Government” to “take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis, provided that the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary,” per the presidential memo (PM). WATCH — President Trump Signs Multiple Executive Orders in Front of Cheering Crowd: As a result, OMB and the OPM issued a memo on Monday providing guidance to agencies. “As of January 24th, agencies should have already notified employees of their intent to comply with the PM directing agencies to return all eligible employees to full-time in-person work,” the memo reads in part, as both the OMB and OPM are directing all agencies to “prepare implementation plans that describe their approach to fully complying with this PM and overcoming any constraints in achieving full compliance.” The memo states that agencies should prepare their plans and submit to both the OMB and OPM for review by Friday, February 7, at 5 p.m. Eastern. WATCH — Vision for the Future! The Trump 2.0 Agenda: Agencies are to describe how they will “revise telework agreements” and give timelines for employees to return to work in-person. They are also required to “identify any risks, barriers, or resource constraints that would prevent the expeditious return of all eligible employees to in-person work” and provide their criteria for determining if there are “other compelling reasons” an employee could not return to office. The full memo can be foundhere. Many celebrated after Trump signed the order requiring federal employees to return to work. “No more showing up to work one day a month. If you’re going to collect a paycheck from the government, you actually have to show up to work! President Trump signs order mandating federal workers show up in-person for work,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote on social media, sharing a video of his fathersigningthe memo.

Sharpton shared a video walking through the Costco on Saturday with the caption, “Leading a buy-in with 100+ @NationalAction members at the @Costco location in Harlem, NYC to show support for the company’s strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).” “This comes as DEI policies face growing attacks from both President Trump and the private sector,” he added, purchasing 100 $25 gift vouchers for those participating in his “buy-in.” However, his action did not generate positive results across the board. “Sharpton’s out here pushing DEI like it’s a good thing. Newsflash: Costco doesn’t need your ‘support’, they need to focus on serving customers, not pushing a woke agenda,” one social media usersaid. “We’ll keep shopping with businesses that actually care about quality, not politics.” “Al Sharpton is a race hustler.

The move follows the Trump administration creating a culture of weeding out woke hiring practices, but Costco isrefusingto go in that direction, sticking to its DEI guns. Costco shareholders shot down a proposal to evaluate their DEI practices at the request of the company’s board of directors. According to the Associated Press, the board of directorsstatedin part that “our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary.” “The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information,” the board of directors added. President Donald Trump made clear throughout his campaign that he would end former President Joe Biden’s DEI mandates, favoring a merit-based system instead. He took executive action on this on his first week in office with an executive actiontitled, “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.” “Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system,” the executive action reads in part, making it clear that Americans who work hard should not be “stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex.” “The Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws,” it continues. “The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.” Pleaselet us knowif you're having issues with commenting.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "The following content is sponsored byAmericans for Limited Government. President Donald Trump is right: Joe Biden broke Medicare. Under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), seniors and patients pay higher insurance premiums and more out-of-pocket costs for less healthcare coverage.Trump must stop Biden’s midnight Medicare rule before February 1, or it will trigger mandates that could destroy Medicare’s popular Part D program. Biden was a disaster from his first day in office to the final days of his administration. In a cynical, last-minute move before leaving office, his administration snuck IRA price controls on 15 prescription drugs. This wasn’t about helping seniors. It was about sticking the Trump administration with burdensome regulations before he was sworn in as president. Biden bureaucrats rushed this broken rule, setting up Medicare for failure during Trump’s term. Trump has to freeze implementation by February 1 to stop the damage, or the rule will trigger mandates that make it hard to roll back. Make no mistake: Biden’s IRA price controls will hurt seniors and many Americans who need these treatments. Like Kamala’s price control proposal during her failed campaign, these price controls are set by bureaucratic mandate and enforced with a 95 percent tax on any company that doesn’t comply. Even theWashington Postrecognized how terrible these price controls are: “It’s hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is. It is, in all but name, a sweeping set of government-enforced price controls across every industry, not only food. Supply and demand would no longer determine prices or profit levels. Far-off Washington bureaucrats would. … At best, this would lead to shortages, black markets and hoarding, among other distortions seen previous times countries tried to limit price growth by fiat.” To make things worse, our government’s giant health bureaucracy hasn’t set up a proper system to manage drug prices or ensure pharmacies are reimbursed correctly. Local pharmacies are already saying they won’t be able to provide medications when the program begins in 2026. According to a survey, over 90 percent of independent pharmacists said they won’t have the resources to handle the changes. Biden’s IRA already caused Medicare Part D premiums to skyrocket. The IRA lowered the out-of-pocket maximum for seniors from about $3,300 to $2,000 by shifting the responsibility for the $1,300 difference to insurance companies. That sounds great, but insurance companies pass that cost on to consumers through higher premiums and restricted access to prescription drugs. This year, premiums for Medicare Part D are up more than 20 percent for the more than 50 million Americans enrolled. Seniors are paying more, and taxpayers are also on the hook for higher subsidies to these plans. The Congressional Budget Office says the IRA’s drug rules alone will increase Medicare costs by up to $20 billion in 2025. Thankfully, Trump is just getting started. He has already reversed many of Biden’s disastrous mandates and rules. In his first days back, Trump canceled 78 of Biden’s “unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical” executive orders. He froze spending on IRA programs to protect Americans from these deep state regulations from implementation. Joe Biden broke Medicare, but Donald Trump can fix it. With Trump’s leadership, premiums can go down, seniors will have more plan options, and Medicare will work better for everyone. Trump can start by freezing Biden’s IRA drug rule before the end of this week. Pleaselet us knowif you're having issues with commenting.     Copyright © 2025 Breitbart",

        "content": "Border Czar Tom Homan said Monday on Fox News Channel’s “America Reports” that he would not apologize to actress Selena Gomez, who broke down over the ongoing mass deportations. Earlier, actress Selena Gomez posted an Instagram video of herself in tears, commenting on the ICE raids. Gomez said, “I just want to say that I’m so sorry. All my people are getting attacked! The children. I don’t understand. I’m so sorry. I wish I could do something, but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I’ll try everything. I promise.” Co-host Sandra Smith said, “I don’t know if you had a chance to see a video that has been going viral over the past hour or so. We’re still working to clear it and show it. In fact, the Hollywood celebrity who posted it has now deleted it, I think because probably she faced a lot of backlash for it, noting even The New York Times and Fox News polls show that a majority of American respondents are in favor of deportations of criminals and gang members. She posted a video sobbing. She was crying in it. She said, all my people are getting attacked with the picture of a Mexican flag. Again, she has now taken that down. But what do you say to those who are out there saying that these are everyday people, these are families that are being attacked and dragged out of their homes? How do you respond to that?” Homan said, “I don’t think we arrested any families. We’ve arrested public safety threats and national security threats, bottom line. And look, President Trump won the election on this one issue, securing our border and saving lives. What happened on our southern border, last four years, is the biggest national security threat this country’s seen, at least in my lifetime, because we got over two million known getaways. We got a 600% increase in sex trafficking. We got a record number of terrorists crossing the border on the terrorist watch list. We have a quarter million Americans diving in Fentanyl coming across the open border. We’re going to do this job, and we’re going to enforce the laws of this country. If they don’t like it, then go to Congress and change the law.” He added, “We’re going to do this operation without apology. We’re going to make our communities safer. We’re going to save. Once we lock that border, we’re going to continue this operation you’re going to see fentanyl deaths decrease, illegal alien crime decrease, sex trafficking decrease. It’s all for the good of the nation. We are going to keep going. No apologies. We are going to keep going.” Follow Pam Key on X@pamkeyNEN Pleaselet us knowif you're having issues with commenting.     Copyright © 2025 Breitbart",

I’ve actually seen some video this weekend of Latinos who voted for Trump crying because now their abuelas and their tíos are getting deported. I’m having a very hard time mustering up any sympathy for those people.” She continued, “I’m an immigrant. I know the desperation that it takes to leave your country. Amongst immigrants in particular, there is no doubt that we want anybody who had the opportunity to come to this great country and committed a crime, we want them punished. We want them deported to the fullest extent of the law, but a lot of good, hardworking people who are in our schools, who are our colleagues, who own houses and businesses here, who are the parents of U.S. citizen children are getting caught up in this because it’s been reported that ICE officers all over the country have been given a quota. There is no way they meet that quota with just criminal aliens.” She added, “I think what he’s done with the military in addition to the legal aspects that may be involved has a lot to do with a publicity stunt. The point is cruelty. the point is instilling fear.” Navarro concluded, “All of those people crying right now and feeling bad by the way they voted, there’s going to be another election in two years, and we’re going to have to wait two years of pain. So if you want things to change get yourselves registered, get yourself active. There’s no reason why we should be rolling over and playing dead.” Follow Pam Key on X@pamkeyNEN Pleaselet us knowif you're having issues with commenting.     Copyright © 2025 Breitbart",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice (DOJ)issueda memorandum Friday pledging to end the “weaponization” of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act and dismissing three ongoing FACE Act cases. The FACE Act is a 1994 law thatprohibits“violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services.” The act was written to equally protect abortion clinics, pro-life pregnancy resource centers, and churches; however, 97 percent of FACE Act cases since the law’s inception have beenagainstpro-life advocates. RELATED VIDEO — Footage Released of “Jane’s Revenge” Vandal “If Abortion Isn’t Safe, Neither R U”:  The Biden administration used the law to aggressively prosecute, and sometimes imprison, pro-life activists.Data obtained by Rep. Chip Roy’s (R-TX) officefoundthat, in less than four years, Biden’s DOJ accounted for more than a quarter of all 211 FACE prosecutions since the law’s inception. At least 55 FACE Act cases were prosecuted during the Biden administration, only a handful of which were against pro-abortionattackson pregnancy centers, despite theincreasein attacksagainstpro-life pregnancy centers and churches following the Supreme Court’sDobbsdecision. “President Trump campaigned on the promise of ending the weaponization of the federal government and has recently directed all federal departments and agencies to identify and correct the past weaponization of law enforcement.To many Americans, prosecutions and civil actions under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (“FACE Act”) have been the prototypical example of this weaponization. And for good reason,” the DOJ memo reads. “Even though more than 100 crisis pregnancy centers, pro-life organizations, and churches were attacked in the immediate aftermath of theDobbsdecision, nearly all prosecutions under the FACE Act have been against pro-life protesters. That is not the even-handed administration of justice,” the memo continues. The DOJ said that, going forward, federal law enforcement and prosecutorial resources will only be “devoted to the most serious violations of federal law ” and that “future abortion-related FACE Actprosecutions and civil actions will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances, or in cases presenting significant aggravating factors, such as death, serious bodily harm, or serious property damage.” “Cases not presenting significant aggravating factors can adequately be addressed under state or local law. Additionally, until further notice, no new abortion-related FACE Act actions — criminal or civil — will be permitted without authorization from the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division,” the memo reads. In light of those changes, the DOJ ordered the dismissal of three FACE Act cases:U.S. v. Connolly,U.S. v. Zastrow, andU.S. v. Citizens for a Pro-Life Society. “If needed, further case-specific guidance will follow for cases in which a criminal conviction has already been obtained but in which a sentenced has not yet been imposed, or in which the appeals are not yet completed, that did not present significant aggravating factors,” the memo concludes. The DOJ memo was sent just one day after Trumppardonednearly two dozen pro-life activists targeted by the Biden administration. In several cases, Biden’s DOJ added a KKK-era “conspiracy against rights” charge tobolsterpotential sentencing time, and for a few cases, the FBI allegedlyconductedearly morning raids against pro-life advocates, even allegedly holding them at gunpoint in front of their families. Some of the activists targeted by the Biden DOJ include an 89-year-oldsurvivorof a communist concentration camp, severalgrandmothers, and a Christianfatherof 11. Thomas More Society, whichsubmitted pardon petitionsfor 21 of the 23 activists pardoned, celebrated the DOJ’s FACE Act actions and said “these cases should have never been brought…” “Thomas More Society welcomes the news that the Department of Justice has been directed to dismiss with prejudice three remaining FACE Act cases brought against our peaceful pro-life clients. In all three of these cases, our attorneys have led the defense of pro-life advocates targeted by Biden’s DOJ—which had sought crushing penalties, fines, and injunctions against them, to stop them from sharing their pro-life message,” Thomas More Society Executive Vice President and Head of Litigation Peter Breen said in a statement. “These cases should have never been brought and we are thankful to the Trump administration for righting that wrong. While this handful of cases are now slated for dismissal, there is no shortage of ongoing attacks on life-affirming ministries across the country, as pro-abortion states double down on anti-life policies and lawfare,” he continued. “As these legal battles multiply in pro-abortion states, we will tirelessly continue to defend the entire pro-life movement.” RELATED: Federal Judge Pauses FACE Act Case Against Pro-Lifers Until Trump’s White House Return Some Republicans are looking to do away with the FACE Act altogether. Rep.Roy and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)reintroduceda billlast week that would repeal the FACE Act, which they contend is an “unconstitutional federal takeover of state police powers”: “These Americans are peaceful, pro-life Americans who were singled out and targeted by their government solely because of their beliefs. This is a tremendous step towards righting the wrongs done under Biden, but Congress must also take the step to repeal the FACE Act to ensure it can never again be weaponized by a future administration,” Roy said. “That’s why last Congress, I introduced legislation to repeal it with my friend, Sen. Mike Lee. [Ninety-seven percent] of FACE Act prosecutions between the years of 1994-2024 were initiated against pro-life Americans; it is laughable to argue that the law hasn’t been weaponized. Let’s put H.R. 589 on the President’s desk and end this once and for all,” he added. Pam Bondi, Trump’s attorney general nominee,pledgedduring her confirmation hearing to equally enforce the FACE Act. Katherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Scott’s story is that of the American Dream.” WATCH — Trump Treasury Nom Shuts Down Liz Warren: Do You Want More Revenue or to Hurt Billionaires?: Trump also added that Bessent “has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda,” and noted that he would assist Trump in ushering “in a new Golden Age for the United States.” Bessent has previouslycalledfor making the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act “permanent” and for “new pro-growth policies” to be implemented in order to “reduce the tax burden on American manufacturers, service workers, and seniors.” Bessent has alsowarnedthat failing to keep the Trump tax cuts would bring the U.S. economy to a “sudden stop.” WATCH — Roasted!

        "content": "On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Deadline,” Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO) said he was not going to tolerate the Trump administration’s mass deportations of children and families. Host Nicolle Wallace said, “The Trump administration says this is just the beginning, the opening salvo, if you will. They’ve indicated that one of the next towns could that could be targeted could be Aurora, Colorado.” She asked, “What are you hearing from your constituents?” Crow said, “Well Nicolle I represent one of the most diverse communities in the country, and I just want to paint a picture for you. This is a community where nearly 20% of my constituents were born outside of the United States. I have 130 languages spoken in my public school system.  And these folks are business owners. They go to school with my kids. They work in our businesses. They are so much a part of the lifeblood and the strength  and the vibrancy of our community. They are afraid. Which is why I’m standing up and I’m being very clear about what we’re going to tolerate and what we won’t.” He added, “I think this. is important for every American right. now to be really clear about what it is we’re dealing with. I haven’t heard or talked to anybody who says we shouldn’t deport and detain violent criminals, that we shouldn’t clean up our streets and keep communities, keep our children safe. Everybody agrees on that, and it’s already a crime. What we’re talking about is a mass deportation. A mass deportation that’s rounding up everybody, children, families. business owners. And I would like somebody in the Trump Administration to explain to me how doing that is actually going to reduce costs, help our businesses, help our communities, and make us more safe, because doing that will do the exact opposite and they know it.” Wallace said, “So what is the list of what you will tolerate and will not for your district?” Crow said, “Well, I’m not going to tolerate mass deportation of efforts of children and families and people who are striving to start a life here, who want to normalize their status within the United States. We owe those folks. comprehensive immigration reform, because that’s in our best interests of our economy.” Follow Pam Key on X@pamkeyNEN Pleaselet us knowif you're having issues with commenting.

A federal official characterized the actions as in the interest of public safety and national security. On Sunday evening, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Antonio posted photographs on X showing a multi-agency operation carrying out enforcement actions. The photos indicate the raids resulted in the arrests of dozens of migrants. The task force included HSI, DEA, ATF, CBP, and the Texas Department of Public Safety law enforcement officers. The post indicates the task force took action to “enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities. Texas Governor Greg Abbott confirmed that state troopers are partnering with the federal task forces across the state. According to areporton Fox 7 Austin, task force officers conducted operations in Austin over the weekend. The raids began around 8 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Glori Chavez posted a video on X showing migrants being repatriated. The actions led to the repatriation of more than 735 illegal aliens from countries including Cuba, Honduras, Venezuela, Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras that had entered the U.S. illegally.

Get a load of this… Greg Gutfeld’s late-night showGutfeld!averaged 443,000 demo viewers in the 25-54 age range that sets advertising rates. That’s only 5,000 fewerdemo viewersthan CNN’s averagetotalprimetime viewership that same week. Russia Hoax Queen Rachel Maddow is nowhere near the cable powerhouse she once was. Out of every cable news show, she landed in the 14thspot. She used to be number one or two. Fox News snagged 14 of the 15 top programs. And it’s not as though there was a lack of news. We had wildfires. We had all the news surrounding Joe Biden’s pardons and Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House. There was Biden’s farewell address, the drama around TikTok, someconfirmation hearings, and the Israeli ceasefire. So… Compared to this same week one year ago, Fox News saw a 43 percent jump in primetime viewers and a 50 percent jump in total day viewers. But-but-but CNNLOL lost 17 percent of its already basement-rated primetime viewership and lost 13 percent of its already humiliating total day viewers. MSNBC lost an even higher percentage. Compared to last year, the far-left outlet shed 30 percent of its primetime viewership and 30 percent of its total day viewership. The raw numbers are simply mind-blowing: TOTAL PRIMETIME VIEWERS / PRIMETIME 25-54 DEMO VIEWERS FOX NEWS:2.994 million / 363,000 CNNLOL:448,000 / 93,000 MSNBC:758,000 / 64,000 — TOTAL TOTAL-DAY VIEWERS / TOTAL DAY 215-54 DEMO VIEWERS FOX NEWS:1.991 million  / 236,000 CNNLOL:379,000 / 66,000 MSNBC:523,000 / 46,000 CNN’s total day average cannot even hit 400,000. What’s so hilarious about the glorious slow death of CNN is what the suits are doing to fix it. Instead of hiring new talent to replace the humorless and smug serial liars who have alienated forever 99.95 percent of the country, these idiots are just moving those humorless and smug serial liars around.Jury-confirmed liarJake Tapper will now start his nightly lying an hour later. The ridiculous Kasie Hunt will now fail later in the day instead of early in the morning. Wolf Blitzer will fail in the morning instead of the afternoons. Yeah, that’ll do it. Allow me to sum up the regime media’s problem with one cut and paste: No one trusts these people. No one likes these people. All they do is lie in service to the collectivist state. And now, hardly anyone watches these people. Best of all, they have lost all their influence and moral authority. Trump broke them all. They burned themselves down trying to destroy him.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Outrage erupted after the Palestinian leader commended Yasser Abu Bakr, a convicted murderer who was released in Israel’s ceasefire deal with the terrorist group Hamas. Long-serving Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas called Yasser Abu Bakr, a former prisoner convicted of deadly terror attacks on Israelis, to congratulate him after his release under a ceasefire deal,accordingto Israeli media reports. Abu Bakr had been serving a 115-year sentence for his involvement in attacks that killed Israeli civilians, including a nine-month-old infant. In a recording, Abbas reportedly praised Abu Bakr for enduring imprisonment “for the Palestinian nation,” suggesting his sentence was unjust. The call drew sharp criticism from Israeli officials, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, wholabeledAbbas “a supporter of terror” and dismissed the Palestinian Authority as a viable alternative to Hamas. Many others also slammed Abbas — who has remained president for over 20 years despite a four-year term limit — accusing him of glorifying violence and undermining peace efforts. “Abbas is a corrupt, terrorist pig,” declared conservative commentator Mark Levin. “Remember this the next time someone tells you Abbas is a ‘partner for peace,’” wrote speechwriter Aviva Klompas. “When the Palestinian Authority denounces Trump’s plan to move Gazans to Egypt & Jordan, we should remind them of YESTERDAY when their leader Mahmoud Abbas called released terrorist Yasser Abu Bakr to congratulate him. He was sentenced to 115 years in jail for murdering three Israelis, including a 9-month-old baby,” noted radio host Ari Hoffman. Recently, Israel freed 200 prisoners, many serving life sentences, in exchange for four female IDF hostages under a ceasefire deal following Hamas’s October 7 massacre. The terrorist organization and other groups celebrated the releases, while Israel remains wary of the implications for future peace efforts. The radical Palestinian Authority,which was established to govern the Palestinian territories, openly supports terror activities against the Jewish state and promotes anti-Israeli sentiments through media and education. Under Mahmoud Abbas, and its associated factions, including Fatah and the PLO, the PA has consistently shown through their actions, policies, and rhetoric that they do not align with the principles of peace. Far from being moderate, these groups support and celebrate violence against Israel, incite hatred through various platforms, and continue to reject peace initiatives, perpetuating conflict rather than seeking resolution. In 2018, the Trump administration cut aid to the Palestinians over its boycott of the U.S. as well as its “pay-for-slay” scheme, whereby the PAis reported to haveallocatednearly $3 million to families of deceased Hamas terrorists as part of a program compensating those involved in terrorist acts, with additional funds for the families and imprisoned members. This payout is part of the “Martyrs’ Fund” initiative, wherein financial rewards are granted for carrying out terrorist attacks, with higher compensation for more destructive acts. In 2023, governments and leaders across the globeexpressedoutrage over “horrifying” remarks concerning Jews and Adolf Hitler expressed by Abbas. The comments were part of a speech he delivered in which he claimed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was not an antisemite and that the Jews of Europe during his era were not killed due to their Jewish identity, but due to their “role in society,” including “usury.” According to MEMRI, Abbas insisted that claims Hitler “killed the Jews for being Jews,” and that “Europe hated the Jews because they were Jews” are “not true.” He went on to defend Hitler against the universally held view that he was “antisemitic.” The Palestinian leader has a longhistoryof Holocaustdenial, dating back to his doctoral thesis, which disputed the number of Jews killed by the Nazis. He has previously apologized for similar remarks in the past. Joshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News. Email him at jklein@breitbart.com. Follow him on Twitter@JoshuaKlein.

        "content": "President Donald Trump on Monday suggested removing serial American criminals from the United States and imprisoning them in another country for a fee. Trump revealed his idea while addressing the House Republican Conference at Trump National Doral Golf Club in Florida. Trump zoned in on violent criminals who have lengthy rap sheets, noting some have over 30 or 40 arrests under their belts. “We also have many violent criminals in our country, however, that did not necessarily come here illegally, but have been arrested 30 times, 35 times, 41,42 times, in a couple of cases,” Trump said. He then highlighted heinous crimes, ranging from murder in general to criminals pushing passengers in front of subways to baseball bat assaults to violent home invasions of elderly folks. “I don’t want these violent repeat offenders in our country any more than I want illegal aliens from other countries who misbehave,” Trump said. “And I say, and this is subject to getting it approved, but if they’ve been arrested many, many times–they’re repeat offenders by many numbers–I want them out of our country,” he added. “I also will be seeking permission to do so.” Trump then said America would pay “a very small fee” to a “foreign land” that housed the worst of criminals: We’re going to get approval, hopefully, to get them the hell out of our country, along with others. Let them be brought to a foreign land and maintained by others for a very small fee, as opposed to be maintained in our jails for massive amounts of money, including the private prison companies that charge us a fortune. No, let them be brought out of our country and let them live there for a while. Let’s see how they like it. Trump said crime rates would drop dramatically around the country. Trump’s pitch comes as his administration, under the lead of Border Czar Tom Homan, is prioritizing removing violent criminal illegal aliens in the first stages of Trump’s mass deportation operation. Immigrations and Customs Patrol nabbed 538 illegal aliens, including many child predators, several gang members, and a suspected terrorist, on Thursday alone, Breitbart Newsreported.

President Donald Trump spent his first day back in officesigningseveral executive orders related to border security and illegal immigration. Among them was the “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” order, which initiates the expedited removal of persons illegally residing in the United States. A Department of Homeland Security officialrevealedlast week that the Department of Justice has given U.S. Marshals Service, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and other federal agencies the authority to investigate and apprehend illegal aliens. “Mobilizing these law enforcement officials will help fulfill President Trump’s promise to the American people to carry out mass deportations,” the DHS spokesperson said. “For decades, efforts to find and apprehend illegal aliens have not been given proper resources. This is a major step in fixing that problem.” The administration is currentlyapprehendinghundreds of violent criminal aliens a day.

He said military training would be focused on readiness and what troops in the field need to deter enemies. “We will be no better friend to our allies and no stronger adversary to those who want test us and try us,” he said. “I look forward to serving the troops, and the warriors of this department. It’s an honor of a lifetime, and we’re going to get to work. God bless you all,” he said. Asked if he would fire the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

President-elect Donald Trump vowed to take on big Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) at a Monday press conference at Mar-a-Lago. Trump ally Speaker Mike Johnson will start the president-elect’s plan to knock out the big insurance middleman in the end-of-year government spending package. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s end-of-year spending bill could include a critical part of Trump’s healthcare agenda: cracking down on Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) middlemen who drive up drug prices for seniors. The Trump-Musk efficiency commission will claw back the $3 billion that Biden and Harris are spending on a new federal healthcare bureaucracy and instead put the focus back on stabilizing Medicare where it belongs. Seniors in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin are turning away from the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration and shifting their support to Donald Trump, who has made clear promises to fix inflation and lower healthcare costs. As vice president, Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote that’s now making seniors’ Medicare Part D premiums skyrocket faster than a SpaceX rocket. Kamala Harris is threatening price controls on as much of the economy as she can get her hands on. If we get four more years of the Harris-Biden administration, we won’t have any intellectual property left for China to steal. This is yet another instance where Democrats will sacrifice the needs of vulnerable Americans on the altar of their Green God. This is yet another instance where Democrats will sacrifice the needs of vulnerable Americans on the altar of their Green God. Joe Biden’s disastrous Inflation Reduction Act hasn’t just sabotaged Americans’ wallets, it’s sabotaged their health as well. Joe Biden is giving billions to China’s economy, while cutting Medicare for seniors and killing American jobs. “I’m going to continue to work to bust this up,” Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) told UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty at a Wednesday hearing on Capitol Hill. It seems like when Obama said: “If you like your plan, you can keep it,” “This won’t cover illegal aliens,” “This won’t add a dime to the deficit,” or even “Obama cares,” what he meant was: “We will make your healthcare a badly run vertically integrated monopoly that will withhold care, enrich executives, and expose you to hackers.” It seems like when Obama said: “If you like your plan, you can keep it,” “This won’t cover illegal aliens,” “This won’t add a dime to the deficit,” or even “Obama cares,” what he meant was: “We will make your healthcare a badly run vertically integrated monopoly that will withhold care, enrich executives, and expose you to hackers.” In addition to destroying normal people’s ability to pay for oil, housing, and food, now Democrats have their sights set on medicine.

        "content": "Connecticut’s Democrat Governor Ned Lamont is proudly telling illegal migrants to feel free to move to his state as he is also pushing for even more H-1B migrants to take American jobs. “You’re welcome here,” Lamont said in a recent press conference. CT Insiderreported: Last week, Lamont said, “My advice is, send your kids to school. My advice is, keep going to church. We don’t collect the immigration status of people who are going to church or kids who are at school. Our cops are busy trying to keep the streets safe, they’re not asking the immigration status of somebody who’s caught jaywalking or speeding.” Lamont’s Attorney General William Tong added that Lamont’s administration “respects” and “honors” immigrants and will protect them. “It is the policy of the state of Connecticut to respect, honor and protect immigrants and immigrant families in full compliance with the law,” Tong said. “We’re going to do what we can for immigrants and immigrant families because they’re important to us.” Republicans, though, have pushed back on Lamont’s plan to open the state for an even greater invasion of illegals. “We can serve to assist our federal partners and their scarce resources by getting the most dangerous people out of our communities. And the current Trust Act prevents that from happening,” GOP Rep. Greg Howard said at a press conference held in the state capital in Hartford, CT Insiderreported. In a recentsurveyin the Nutmeg State, companies — especially those in the tech sector –say they are already dependent on importing foreign workers, according to the CT Mirror. The paper’s survey of companies found that about 20 percent of the state’s high-end job makers say they are dependent on importing foreign workers with the H-1B visa program. The program allows “highly skilled” foreign workers to live and work in the United States for a three-year stint with an option to extend that to six. Critics of the program say that companies that import these workers pay them less than they would an American because they have an edge over the foreign workers, since they can simply report them for deportation if they don’t toe the company line. Further, there is no obligation to keep them for the long term, either, since the visas are for limited times. It is almost like indentured servitude, detractors claim. A separatereviewof foreign workers conducted by the American Immigration Council finds that foreigners fill around 25 percent of jobs in key industries in Connecticut. While it is unsurprising that 70 percent of maids, cleaning, and domestic workers are foreign-born, it was also reported that 44 percent of scientists and science-related workers are foreign-born, along with 39 percent of nursing workers and 38 percent of software workers. The AIC also reported that 28 percent of general services workers are immigrants, 26 percent of construction workers are foreign, and migrants make up 25 percent of transportation and warehousing jobs, 23 percent of hospitality jobs, and 21 percent of manufacturing jobs. And overall, the state’s labor force is 20 percent foreign-born. Meanwhile, only 16 percent of the state’s population is made up of immigrants. Connecticut is one of the Democrat-controlled states looking toopposeDonald Trump’s deportation efforts and has laws preventing police from cooperating with federal authorities.

A White House document on the upcoming executive order reviewed by Breitbart News notes the order will direct the DOD “to update its guidance regarding trans-identifying medical standards for military service and to rescind guidance inconsistent with military readiness.” Hegseth will be directed to update medical standards within the department “to ensure they prioritize readiness and lethality” and to prohibit “the use of invented and identification-based pronouns in the Department of Defense.” The document on the upcoming order emphasizes that cohesion in military units necessitates “integrity and stability among servicemembers.” “It can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after so-called transition surgery, which often involves the use of heavy narcotics,” it reads. “In this time, they are not physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and continue to require consistent medical care,” the document adds.“This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements.” The expected action will revoke an executive order from former President Joe Biden that established accommodation for “gender identity” in the military. The White House document emphasizes Biden’s order was “to the detriment of military readiness and unit cohesion.” Moreover, the order would protect female servicemembers by ensuring that males cannot use female-designated facilities, including where women servicemembers sleep, change, and bathe. Trump is also expected to sign an order on Monday “to restore Merit and Lethality to America’s Armed Forces.” The order will prohibit “the use of discriminatory race or sex-based preferences by any element of the Armed Forces, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Homeland Security” and abolishes DEI in the DOD and DHS, a White House document on the expected directive notes. Trump is ordering Hegseth to initiate a review within the DOD of instances where its now defunct DEI initiatives led to “race or sex-based discrimination.” According to the White House document on the order, Hegseth and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must also review the curriculums of the “United States Service Academies and other academic institutions to ensure” that they end gender and DEI ideologies.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s Department of Education (DoEd) began eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and squashed what it called “Biden’s Book Ban Hoax” in the first week of Trump’s second term. In response to Trump’sexecutive ordercracking down on DEI in the federal government, as well asguidancefrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the department said it removed or archived hundreds of DEI guidance documents, reports, and training materials from its outward facing communication channels. The DoEd said it also put employees in charge of leading DEI initiatives on paid administrative leave. “These actions are in line with President Trump’s ongoing commitment to end illegal discrimination and wasteful spending across the federal government. They are the first step in reorienting the agency toward prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in our schools,”the departmentsaidin a press release. The department specifically eliminated itsDiversity & Inclusion Council, which wasestablishedvia executive order by then-President Barack Obama. Trump rescinded that Obama-era executive order and issued a new one called “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” which ultimately terminated the council, along with the Employee Engagement Diversity Equity Inclusion Accessibility Council (EEDIAC) within the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The DoEd also: The department said it will continue to review its programs to “identify additional initiatives and working groups that may be advancing a divisive DEI agenda, including programs using coded or imprecise language to disguise their activity.” “These review efforts will continue as the Department works to end discrimination based on race and the use of harmful race stereotypes, both within the agency and throughout America’s education system,” the department said. Trump’s DoEd also ended “Biden’s Book Ban Hoax.” During the Biden administration, parents and conservatives waged a campaign against inappropriate, andsometimes even pornographic, materials in schools. Whileconcerned parentsand local school boards argued that they should have more control over shaping curriculum and the kinds of materials in school libraries, Democrats andteachers’ unionspainted the effort as “book banning.” Incoming OCR leadership began a review of pending “book banning” cases at the department on January 20, and attorneys ultimately confirmed that “books are not being ‘banned,’ but…school districts, in consultation with parents and community stakeholders, have established commonsense processes by which to evaluate and remove age-inappropriate materials,accordingto the DoEd. The department’s OCR ultimately dismissed 11 complaints related to so-called “book bans. The complaints claimed that local school districts’ removal of inappropriate or obscene materials from school libraries created a hostile environment for students — a claim the DoEd called “meritless” and “premised upon a dubious legal theory.” As of January 24, the OCR rescinded all guidance issued under that legal theory, which claimed that removing inappropriate books from school libraries may violate civil rights laws. The OCR additionally dismissed six pending allegations of book banning and will no longer employ a “book ban coordinator” to investigate local school districts and parents. “Because this is a question of parental and community judgment, not civil rights, OCR has no role in these matters,” the department said in a press release. Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainorsaidin a statement that the department’s efforts are the “beginning [of] the process ofrestoring the fundamental rights of parents to direct their children’s education.” “The department adheres to the deeply rooted American principle that local control over public education best allows parents and teachers alike to assess the educational needs of their children and communities. Parents and school boards have broad discretion to fulfill that important responsibility. These decisions will no longer be second-guessed by the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education,” Trainor continued. Katherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Far-left President of Honduras Xiomara Castro on Sunday called for an emergency meeting of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) later this week to discuss President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal migrants in the United States. CELAC is a 33-country bloc founded in Caracas in 2011, largelypromotedby Venezuela’s late socialist dictator Hugo Chávez as a U.S-free alternative regional structure to the Organization of American States (OAS), of which the United States is a member. Castro, who presently chairs the bloc’s yearly rotating pro-tempore presidency, called for the urgent meeting, scheduled for Thursday, January 30, 2025. The encounter will occur in the aftermath of Colombian far-left President Gustavo Petro’sbriefdiplomatic crisis with the United States, a short-lived “trade war” thanks to his refusal to welcome a flight carrying deported Colombian immigrants. Petro initially refused the flight on the grounds that the United States treats “Colombian migrants as criminals.” In her official letter calling for the meeting, President Castro announced that Gustavo Petro will travel to the Honduran capital city of Tegucigalpa to participate in the meeting. The event will address migration, the environment, and “Latin American and Caribbean unity” as its three main subjects. Petro isslatedto assume CELAC’s pro-tempore chair in “a matter of weeks” once Castro’s tenure at the head of the regional bloc ends. The Colombian government confirmed Petro’s attendance of the CELAC meeting in an official statementissuedon Sunday afternoon, right as Petro’s short-lived feud with the United States unfolded. According to the Colombian government, the South American nation held talks with Honduras to “promote a regional approach to migration challenges and ensure conditions of dignity for the citizens of the region.” In the same statement, the Colombian government explained that, “under the leadership of President Gustavo Petro” the Colombian presidential plane had been arranged to facilitate the “dignified return” of the Colombian deportees that Petro initially refused to admit. “Likewise, the Government of Colombia maintains active conversations with the Government of the United States, seeking agreements that ensure minimum conditions of respect and dignified treatment for compatriots during the deportation process, recognizing them as subjects of rights,” the statement read. “Colombia reaffirms its commitment to the protection of its nationals and will continue to lead regional and international efforts to find humane and fair solutions to migration challenges.” The upcoming CELAC encounter will mark the second gathering of Latin American governments this month to address migration following the start of President Trump’s new administration. In mid-January, a smaller group composed of foreign ministers and representatives of Belize, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuelagatheredin Mexico City to address migration ahead of Trump’s return to the White House. The gathering was a joint initiative by President Castro and Mexican far-left President Claudia Sheinbaum. The Mexico-hosted meeting concluded with a 14-point statement in which the ten participant Latin American nations — while making no direct mention of the United States and President Donald Trump — expressed “serious concern” over announcements of mass deportations, “particularly because of their incompatibility with fundamental human rights principles and their failure to effectively address the structural causes of migration.” Last week, Castroclaimedthat Honduras is in a “defense project and taking different measures for our migrants in the face of threats of expulsion from the United States.” The far-left president also asserted that Honduran migrants in the United States “are not a burden, but an engine of development.” “I can proudly say that Hondurans are the best workforce in the United States, proving that we are not a burden, but rather a driving force for the development of that nation,” Castro reportedly said in a message read by her Vice President Renato Florentino at a parliamentary event. “We reaffirm the defense of their rights. Our migrants have earned every dollar with their honorable and hard work that they send to their families, the fruit of their effort, their sweat and their determination,” her message continued. During her January 1 New Year speech, Castrothreatenedto have the United States’ military base in Honduras shut down if President Trump’s administration carries out mass deportations of Hondurans.

On Monday, Gomezpostedand thendeleteda sniveling Instagram Story, in which she cried, “I just wanted to say that I’m so sorry.” “All my people are getting attacked, the children. I don’t understand. I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I’ll try everything, I promise,” Gomez sobbed to her 422 million Instagram followers. The video was met with intense backlash from viewers, who pointed out that Gomez is crying over violent criminals being deported. Watch Below:  “This is why we don’t take our political advice from Disney child stars,” Tomi Lahrenreacted, before noting that the Trump administration is deporting “criminal aliens, rapists, and murderers,” adding that that are “lucky that they don’t get hung by their toenails.” “We’re just sending them home, Selena. And the fact that you’re defending rapists and murderers just shows how stupid you are,” Lahren added. “Where was the sobbing over the 100,000 Americans dead from fentanyl poisoning?” Charlie Kirkaskedin response to Gomez’s video. “Where were these tears over the 340,000 children who went missing after being trafficked over our border?” “Why wasn’t there a breakdown for Rachel Nungary, Rachel Morin, or Laken Riley?” Kirk added. “I guess those Americans weren’t ‘your people?'” “Selena Gomez filmed herself ugly crying about the current mass deportations,” Savanah Hernandezwrote. “Because of course the out of touch celebrity with zero understanding of how dangerous our country has become is crying for the criminals being deported.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Two Pennsylvania Democrats want to erase biological sex from birth certificates to  enable people to more easily shift their “gender identity” without facing“bureaucratic roadblocks.” State Reps. Benjamin Sanchez and Joe Webster have proposed a bill that would remove the biological reality of sex from birth certificates — a move they say would “eliminate yet another form of discrimination people endure when there is an error in that category.” “As the times change, so does the need to assess our antiquated practices and procedures. Precedent already exists for amending what is required on birth certificate documents. For example, birth certificates used to include the race of an individual’s parents, which had historically been used as a part of systemic discrimination,” the lawmakerssaidin a House co-sponsorship memorandum posted on January 24. “As we have seen, removing race from birth certificate applications has had no impact on the document’s original intention, which is to prove the birth itself and the place in which the child was born. By removing sex from birth certificates, we eliminate yet another form of discrimination people endure when there is an error in that category,” they continued. The Democrats said their bill is based on a recommendation from the left-wing American Medical Association (AMA), an organization which hasembraced “gender identity,”the false belief that one can identify or become a different sex than they were born as.Democratsnarrowly controlthe Pennsylvania House and the governorship, while Republicanscontrolthe state Senate. The lawmakers wrote: Bureaucratic roadblocks make the process of amending government documents complicated as people face discrimination and multiple barriers when changing categories like their sex. Our legislation would fix this issue by removing that bureaucratic roadblock. As recommended by the American Medical Association (AMA), removing sex designations on birth certificates will prevent many problems individuals face by having a different gender identity on this foundational document. Sex will still be reported on the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth system, which is used for medical and statistical data collection, therefore its place on a birth certificate is redundant and unnecessary.We urge you to join us in co-sponsoring this bill to take a simple step to ensure Pennsylvania bureaucracy is not a barrier to any Pennsylvanians living their lives authentically. The AMAcrafted a resolutionin 2021 in favor of removing the terms “male” and “female” from birth certificates, claiming evidence of an individual being born is the only information necessary. The resolution said the live birth certificate should be where sex is noted for the sake of statistics, but that birth certificates should not include sex as it might hamper individuals who at some point decide to live as something other than their biological sex. The AMA hasbackedsex change drugs and mutilating surgeries for youth who believe they are transgender. The organization was notably one of several left-wing medical establishment groups in the United States thataskedthe Biden Department of Justice in 2022 to investigate and prosecute those who disagree with their practices on treating gender dysphoria in children.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "The American people expressed their priorities during the last election, with a key element of the “America First” agenda being fiscal responsibility. The U.S. government operates an overwhelming number of agencies and departments — so many that even search engines struggle to provide an exact count. Billions of dollars in spending have become routine in every area of government, a level of expenditure that, for the average citizen, feels as unattainable as a trip to the moon. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a prime example. With aworkforceof over 17,000 employees and an annualbudgetexceeding $30 billion, FEMA’s role in emergency relief raises questions — not about the need for such relief, but about who should and can provide it best and who should bear the financial burden. Alternatives such as the National Guard and the military could offer viable solutions. Governors already have the authority to activate the National Guard. The President could establish preparedness programs within the military to enhance its ability to provide emergency support. The U.S. currently maintains approximately 450 military bases and installations in the U.S., offering substantial resources that could be leveraged in times of crisis. US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tour a fire-affected area in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on January 24, 2025. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) FEMA’s spending is significant. Shifting responsibilities to individual states could lead to more efficient allocation of funds, as states are better positioned to assess their own needs. In cases where additional assistance is required, governors could activate the National Guard and collaborate with the military. Federal financial aid could still be made available but structured as long-term loans to the states, with interest rates at least equal to the costs incurred by the national debt. This is in line with what Vice President J.D. Vance said in a CBS interview over the weekend. “The FEMA management officials don’t work well enough with state and local officials to get resources to the people who need it,” Vance said. “When there’s a terrible disaster, they should expect food, medicine and water to get to the people who need it. When there’s a terrible fire in California, the fire hydrants ought to actually turn on.” “And it’s not because we don’t have good people at FEMA. It’s because bureaucratic red tape and garbage prevents the rapid deployment of resources to the people who need it the most,” Vance said. The president could also consider whether taxpayers in Kansas, Montana, or any other states should be required to cover the costs of flood damages in Texas or hurricane recovery in Georgia, or fires in California. The Constitution emphasizes that federal taxes should be used for initiatives that benefit all Americans, not specific regions. This conversation about FEMA’s future and the broader role of federal spending is crucial as the nation continues to address questions of efficiency, accountability, and fiscal responsibility.

Some might require you to select what you want to earn cash-back from in yourmobile banking app. The cash can be delivered to you in various ways, as well; it might be put in yourchecking accountautomatically, or you might be able to redeem your cash for gift cards or rewards.

Some banks and online banking platforms, such asonline banksand apps that offer banking services, offer accounts with high-reward cash-back debit cards, which allow you to earn a percentage of cash back from certain types of debit card purchases. The primary difference between cash-back debit cards and cash-back credit cards is the pool of money that the cards pull from. Credit cards are lines of credit; each time you use one, you're borrowing money from the credit card lender that you're expected to pay back. If you don't, you'll have to pay interest on what you've borrowed. Theaverage credit card interest rateis extremely high, so you'll want to pay your balance off each month to avoid paying extra. In comparison, debit cards generally pull money from a checking account, although there areprepaid debit cardsthat work differently. Since it's pulling from your money, you aren't at risk of going into debt by making debit card purchases. But you also won't be able to make debit card purchases if you don't have any money in your checking account. When decidinghow to get a debit cardwith cash-back options you'll regularly use, consider what you generally buy with your debit card. Do you use your debit card primarily for grocery purchases? Do you use your debit card mostly for online shopping? Make sure to find a card that will reward you for the purchases you make most often. Look into how you'll receive your cash back before you commit to a card. For example, If you don't want to have to redeem your cash back for gift cards or other types of rewards, look for a card that puts your cash directly into your checking account. Many cash-back debit cards come with fees. Look for afree checking accountthat has a cash-back debit card with no fees to make sure you aren't paying more in monthly fees than you're earning back. Additionally, make sure that the requirements the debit card puts on how you earn cash back aren't too strict. If you can only buy from specific brands, and you never buy from those brands, you'll be missing out on the core features of your card.

The top student loan refinance companies offer a variety of terms and low interest rates. But keep in mind that refinanced student loans are always issued byprivate student loan lenders—so if you originally had a federal student loan, refinancing means you'll lose some key benefits. If your original loan was from a private lender, though, you may have nothing to lose by refinancing. 0.25% discount on regular rates with AutoPay 5.88% - 9.73% variable and 3.94% - 8.98% fixed (with AutoPay discount) No fees 665 $5,000 to $500,000 Earnest is a strong lender with competitive rates and a variety of term lengths. If you fall on financial hardship, you can skip a payment once per year — though that payment will extend the length of your loan term later. 0.25% AutoPay interest rate discount and a 0.25% direct deposit interest rate discount Variable: 5.99% - 9.99%, Fixed: 4.49% - 9.99% (with AutoPay) Undisclosed $5,000 to full balance SoFi is an excellent lender for borrowers who want competitive APRs and for those who don't want to worry about fees. 0.25% discount on regular rates with AutoPay 6.99% - 13.99% variable and 6.99% - 13.99% fixed (with AutoPay discount, varies by program) Late fee of $25 or 5% of payment, whichever is less Undisclosed $5,000 to $300,000 College Ave is a great lender for borrowers who want multiple options for repayment term lengths and are after a low APR. College Ave also offers many options for contacting customer support. Earnest has some of the most competitive starting rates of any of the best lenders on our list, so if you haveexcellent credit, it could be a good choice for you. Like Earnest's undergraduate and graduate new loans, its refinanced loans have a special perk: the ability to skip one payment every year. You can ask for your first skip once you've made at least six months of consecutive on-time, full principal and interest payments, as long as your loan is in good standing. However, interest will accrue during this time, and the lender will extend the final payoff date of your loan by the length of the skipped payment period. One thing to watch out for is that this lender has higher maximum interest rates. While Earnest eagerly shares its minimum rates, the company doesn't disclose those on the maximum end anywhere. If you have a shakier credit history, you may end up paying more interest than you initially expected. Earnest Student Loan Review Learn more atEarnest. SoFi is an excellent option for refinancing student loans because this lender does not charge anyorigination fees, late fees, or prepayment penalties. SoFi will let you check what rates they qualify for in as little as two minutes with a convenient online prequalification tool that won't hurt your credit score. Borrowers should be aware that SoFi advertises low interest rates; however, these rates are only available to consumers with great credit who set up autopay and direct deposit. SoFi Student Loan Review Learn more atSoFi Student Loans. PenFed offers the lowest maximum fixed refinance rates of any lender on our list. If you have poorer credit and are still able to qualify for a PenFed refinanced loan, you might get a better deal with it than elsewhere. You need to be a member of the credit union to get your loan. If you've served in the military or work at qualifying associations or organizations, you'll qualify. If that doesn't apply, you can easily join by opening a savings account with a $5 minimum deposit. PenFed doesn't offer variable-rate loans, which often start at lower rates than fixed-rate loans — although they can overtake fixed loan rates over time. If you want a variable loan, you won't be able to get one with PenFed. PenFed Student Loan Review Laurel Road offers some of the best fixed rates of all of our lenders, but keep in mind that only 11% of applicants who applied between July 2019 and June 2021 qualified for Laurel Road's top rate, according to the company's website. Don't bank on getting it unless you have excellent credit. If you sign up for aLaurel Road checking account, you'll receive an interest rate discount on your refinanced loan. You can redeem 2x cash back toward student loan payments with theLaurel Road Student Loan Cash Back credit card. Borrowers need to watch out for late fees with this lender. Laurel Road's late fee is $38 or 5% of your payment, whichever is less. If you fall behind on payments, the total cost of your loan will add up. Laurel Road Student Loan Review Splash Financial is a student loan marketplace, not a direct lender. A marketplace allows you to compare loan offers from multiple lenders at once. The marketplace allows you to check your rates with no impact on your credit score. As a result, it's tricky to nail down the exact terms you'll receive with Splash Financial. For instance, some of the company's lending partners have no maximum amount you can refinance, while others have a cap. You may like Splash Financial if you want to compare a bunch of different companies all at once with one application. You should also keep in mind that Splash Financial doesn't underwrite its own loans. As a result, you'll be dealing with whatever partner lender you choose and may have a different experience with them managing your loan than the one you expected. Splash Financial Student Loan Review Citizens Bank's top loan amount of $750,000 is the highest of any lender we compiled that discloses a maximum loan amount. Citizens Bank is also the only brick-and-mortar bank we have listed, which may be a good option for those who are more comfortable with traditional banking. Citizens Bank's minimum of $10,000 is also the highest of any lender on our list. So, if you have a small amount of debt, another lender is probably a better fit for you. Citizens Bank Student Loan Review LendKey is a marketplace, not a direct lender. A student loan marketplace allows you to compare loan offers from multiple lenders at once. The marketplace allows you to check your rates with no impact on your credit score. LendKey partners withcredit unionsand community banks, so you may get a more personalized level of service than you would with a Splash Financial marketplace partner. As a borrower, you should know that LendKey has the lowest maximum refinance amount of any of the best lenders on the list. This probably won't be an issue unless you have a significant amount of loan debt. LendKey Student Loan Marketplace Review College Ave offers 11 repayment term lengths, making it among the most flexible student loan lenders with regard to loan terms. You're able to take out a loan for five to 15 years with College Ave. Many other lenders limit your selection to four or five options — though some others do offer 20-year term lengths (which College Ave does not). You should look out for College Ave's lower maximum refinancing amount. If you have a truly significant amount of debt (we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars), you may not be able to refinance all your debt with College Ave. This won't be the case for the vast majority of borrowers, but it bears noting.

Student loan refinancing is when a private lender repays your existing student loans and then gives you a single new loan to replace them. Depending on your credit score and income, your new loan could come with a lower interest rate, saving you money over the life of the loan. You can also choose new repayment terms, usually within 5-20 years. With student loan financing, a private lender always provides your new loan – whether the existing student loans are federal or private. This makes student loan refinancing different fromstudent loan consolidation. For instance, with student loan consolidation, multiple federal student loans can be combined into a single federal student loan. Before you consider refinancing a student loan, know thatprivate student loans— which all refinanced loans are — are not eligible for the same protections and benefits as federal student loans. These include opportunities for loan forgiveness and more flexibility with repayments. Refinancing student loans can help you save money and simplify your finances. Your refinanced student loan could have a lower interest rate than your current loan — especially if you have good credit and a decent income. That means you'll pay less in interest as you repay the loan. A refinanced student loan also allows you to replace multiple student loans with a single loan. That means you'll be responsible for making just one monthly payment, which could relieve financial stress and help you avoid missing payments. The difference betweenstudent loan refinancing and consolidationcan be confusing, especially because people sometimes use the terms interchangeably. However, these are two different processes, and depending on your financial goals, one may be better for you than the other. Student loan refinancinginvolves restructuring your current loan or loans and getting a new one with updated terms. You'll make a single monthly payment. You can refinance private and federal loans into one combined loan. When you refinance federal loans with a private lender, you'll lose some key borrower protections. Consolidation is the process of combining multiple loans into one. You'll make a single monthly payment after consolidation. When you consolidate loans, your new loan consolidation rate is the weighted average of your old loans' rates, rounded up to the nearest eighth of a percent. If you can get a lower interest rate on your loan, it might pay off to refinance. It could also be worth refinancing your student loan if you have a variable interest rate that's gone up significantly and you want a fixed interest rate so you have predictable payments. However, federal loans have some unique benefits, so only refinance after assessing all of your options. You don't have anything to lose by refinancing a private loan if you can get a better rate and save money. You won't forgo any federal protections such as income-driven repayment plans,  deferment, or forbearance. If you're unsure if refinancing makes sense for you, it's worth using a student loan refinance calculator to see how much you could save. You'll input your current loan terms, along with the terms of the loan you're considering refinancing into, and the calculator will show you both your monthly savings and your potential savings over the lifetime of the new loan. Lenders consider several factors when deciding whether you qualify for student loan refinancing. Your credit score significantly impacts your eligibility to refinance a student loan. You canraise your credit scoreby paying your bills on time, paying off existing debt, and requesting higher credit limits from your credit card company. Income and yourdebt-to-income (DTI) ratioare also important factors. That means earning a raise, getting a higher-paying job, and paying off debts could help you qualify. The lower your debt-to-income ratio, the better. If you still don't qualify, you can consider applying with acosigner. Here are the steps to refinance student loans: Don't just go with the first refinance option you come across; the best student loan refinance company for you will depend on what you're looking for and details like your credit score and existing loan terms. If your main goal in refinancing your student loan is lowering your interest rate, compare the rates you qualify for with several lenders to find the lowest option. Note that the higher your credit score, the better the rates you'll generally be offered. In this guide, we highlight the standout features of our top refinance picks. This can be a good starting place to evaluate what matters most to you. Beyond finding the lowest interest rate, you might look for refinance lenders without fees, lenders with the widest variety of repayment terms, or companies with brick-and-mortar locations so you can visit and discuss your options in person. The Better Business Bureau, a non-profit organization focused on consumer protection and trust, measures businesses using information like their responsiveness to consumer complaints, truthfulness in advertising, and transparency about business practices. Here is each company's score: All of our picks are rated A or higher by the BBB, with the exception of Laurel Road, but its parent company, KeyBank, has an A+ rating. It's important to note that a good BBB grade doesn't guarantee you'll have a good relationship with your lender, nor does a bad BBB grade mean you'll have a bad experience. Read online customer reviews or ask family and friends about their firsthand experience with the company before signing on the dotted line. The best time to refinance student loans may be after you've recently improved your credit score. That way, you'll be more likely to qualify for a lower rate and save on the overall cost of your loan. There is no minimum credit score you need to refinance your student loans. However, you'll likely get a better rate with a higher credit score. The risks of student loan refinancing include losing key protections such as federal loan relief programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. You also won't be eligible for specific repayment options likeincome-driven repayment plans, which take your specific income and family size into account when determining monthly payments. Yes, you can refinance both federal and private student loans. You can also refinance a mix of federal and private student loans into a single private loan. However, be aware that you'll lose the benefits of having a federal student loan, including eligibility for student loan forgiveness. The amount you save when refinancing student loans depends on multiple factors, including your credit score and income. If you qualify for a refinanced student loan with a significantly lower interest rate, you could end up saving thousands of dollars. No, refinancing student loans doesn't hurt your credit in the long term if you stay on top of payments. When you apply for student loan refinancing, the lender will conduct a hard credit check. This can cause a temporary decrease in your credit score. However, if you consistently make on-time loan payments, the refinancing should ultimately positively affect your credit. Business Insider's personal finance experts aim to help you make the best, most informed decisions with your money. In picking the best student loan refinancing companies, we combed through lenders and compared interest rates, terms, and all the fine print. Our coverage of student loan lenders includes student loan refinance reviews, and these reviews inform our top picks in this student loan refinancing guide. We looked for seven factors in determining the best student loan refinance companies, including: The overall rating is a weighted average of these categories. Each category is assigned a weighting based on its impact on your borrowing experience.

Shopping around and comparingcurrent mortgage ratesfrom multiple lenders can help borrowers save money on their monthly mortgage payments and ensure they have a good experience buying or refinancing a home. To find the best mortgage lenders of 2025, we looked for lenders that have low rates and fees, rank high in customer satisfaction, and offer a good variety of loan types.

To make your search for the best lender easier, Business Insider has picked mortgage lenders that are affordable, thrive in customer satisfaction, and offer a variety oftypes of mortgagesto meet different borrowers' needs. Here are the best mortgage lenders of 2025 according to Business Insider editors. Bank of America has some of the lowest average rates and fees, according to the latestHome Mortgage Disclosure Act data. It also ranked high in customer satisfaction in 2024, according toJ.D. Power's Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study. Bank of America has robust offerings for lower-income borrowers. With this lender, you could get up to $7,500 in closing cost assistance and up to $10,000 in down payment assistance. If you already have an account with Bank of America, you may be able to get a discount on yourorigination fee. The lender's Community Affordable Loan Solution is an extremely affordable mortgage aimed at first-time homebuyers. It requires no down payment, closing costs, or mortgage insurance and it has no minimum credit score requirement. What to look out for:To qualify for Bank of America's Community Affordable Loan Solution, you'll need to live in a \"designated market,\" which includes some historically Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Charlotte, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Miami. You'll also need to earn less than the program's income limits. Bank of America Mortgage Review Based on Business Insider's review of HMDA data, Better Mortgage borrowers enjoyed significantly lower rates in 2023 compared to many other lenders we've reviewed. In addition to its low rates, Better Mortgage offers features that make it a convenient option, including a tool that lets you compare rates based on your ZIP code and a quick online application process. Better's fees are also around average, so you shouldn't pay a lot in closing costs to get a good rate with this lender. What to look out for:Better's loan offerings are relatively limited compared to some of the other lenders included on this list. Better Mortgage Review Rocket Mortgage offers a quick, easy online experience and has mortgages with terms as short as eight years — making it a particularly good choice for those who are refinancing, because you can pick the exact term length you need. Most lenders only offer a small couple of term options, such as 15-year and 30-year refinances. Rocket also has a track record of providing great customer service, ranking high for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power's 2024 satisfaction study. Rocket offers a few different affordable mortgage options, including its ONE+ mortgage, which combines a 1% down payment with a 2% grant from the lender. If you don't have a ton of cash saved for your down payment, you might be able to take advantage of this program from Rocket. What to look out for:Its loan options are relatively limited, and it doesn't have any in-person branches. You'll also need to earn 80% or less of thearea median incometo qualify for a ONE+ mortgage. Rocket's rates and fees are around average compared to other lenders, according to HMDA data. Rocket Mortgage Review Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation ranked high for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power's 2024 mortgage origination study, and it has many strong ratings on itsZillow lender pageas well, earning a 4.95 out of 5-star rating based on more than 36,000 online customer reviews. This lender provides many types of home loans and has several term lengths to choose from. It also offers both conventional renovation loans and FHA 203(k) rehabilitation mortgages, giving homebuyers purchasing a fixer-upper a range of mortgage options to choose from. Fairway Independent offers a digital closing option, giving borrowers the ability to have a quick, remote closing experience. You may also be able to use non-traditional credit when applying with this lender. What to look out for:Fairway Independent doesn't show any rates online, not even sample rates. To see what rate you might pay with this lender, you'll need to talk to a loan officer or apply for preapproval. In Business Insider's review of the latest HMDA data, Fairway's rates and fees were around average compared to other lenders. Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation Review Guild Mortgage frequently ranks on our \"best of\" mortgage guides, thanks to its huge variety of mortgage offerings. Borrowers can get a mortgage from this lender using non-traditional credit, such as rent payment history, if they don't have a traditional credit score. Guild also offers a hybrid digital closing option. What to look out for:Guild doesn't display any rates online, making it difficult to get an idea of exactly how affordable this lender it. In our review of the latest HMDA data, Guild's rates and fees were around average compared to other lenders. It also ranked low in J.D. Power's 2024 mortgage origination satisfaction study. Guild Mortgage Review Third Federal Savings and Loan offers a wide range of unique benefits to its mortgage borrowers, including low down payment mortgages with no PMI and generous down payment assistance offerings. This lender also offers a Low Cost Mortgage option where you pay only $295 in closing costs — however, you will pay a slightly higher rate with this option. In our review of the latest HMDA data, we found that Third Federal had low average rates compared to other lenders. What to look out for:Third Federal is only available in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, and Washington, DC. Its only physical branches are in Ohio and Florida. It also doesn't offer any government-backed mortgages. Third Federal Savings and Loan Mortgage Review CrossCountry Mortgage offers a wide range of mortgages, including more niche loan types for those in unique situations. In addition to its standard lineup, you can get manufactured home loans, foreign national loans, bank statement loans, and many other types of mortgages from this lender. Its CCM Smart Start and CCM Community Promise programs also offer down payment assistance for eligible borrowers. CrossCountry doesn't set a minimum credit score on its loans, and it will let you apply for some of its loans with non-traditional credit (like your rent payment history) if you don't have a credit score. What to look out for:CrossCountry Mortgage doesn't display any sample rates online. Through our review of HMDA data we found that this lender's rates and fees are around average. This lender ranks low in customer satisfaction according to J.D. Power. But it has many positive online customer reviews. To qualify for CCM Smart Start, you'll need to be a low-to-middle income first-time homebuyer. To qualify for CCM Community Promise, you'll need to live in an eligible metro area. CrossCountry Mortgage Review Since everyone's circumstances are different, the right lender for you might not be the same lender that's right for someone else. In general, looking for lenders that have low average rates and fees while providing great customer service is a strong place to start. As you shop for a mortgage lender, consider both the rates you're offered as well as other costs you'll pay, including lender fees or discount points. Think about what additional features are important to you, too, such as an easy online application or other digital tools. Not every lender offers every type of mortgage. If you aren't sure what type is right for you, it might be worth talking to amortgage broker, who will have access to many different loan types from a variety of lenders. You'll want to apply for a mortgage with multiple lenders to get an idea of what's available to you. Many experts recommend getting quotes from at least three different lenders to be sure you're getting a good rate. You can getpreapprovedwith multiple lenders to compare rates, but you may get more accurate quotes once you have a signed purchase agreement. Adjustable-rate mortgagessometimes (but not always) have lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages. However, ARMs come with the risk that your rate can go up over time once the intro rate period is over. Make sure you're comparing apples to apples when you compare mortgage rates. This includes both ARMs vs.fixed-rate mortgagesas well as other types of mortgages. For example, government-backed mortgages often have lower rates than conventional loans. If you're buying a home, particularly if you're doing so for the first time, a mortgage lender with good customer service is vital. Home purchase contracts come with tight deadlines and consequences if those deadlines aren't met. You want to work with a lender that is efficient, easy to get ahold of if you need assistance or have questions, and is proactive about potential issues. Speed isn't as vital when you'rerefinancing, since you aren't working against a deadline. But it's still important to have a competent lender. Multiple lenders on this list rank high in customer satisfaction, including Fairway Independent, Rocket Mortgage, and Bank of America. Many mortgage lenders now offer online applications and other services, even if they started as traditional brick-and-mortar lenders. But there can still be some differences between lenders that are only online and lenders with both an online and physical presence. Online-only lenders can sometimes be more affordable because they have fewer operational costs. But this isn't always the case. For example, Bank of America has low average rates and fees despite being a large financial institution with branches around the U.S. You might want to work with a traditional lender if you value in-person support or want to work with a loan officer who is local to you. As you search for the right lender, see which ones have branches near you. You might also want to consider going with a smaller, local lender or credit union. Because they're smaller and work with fewer clients, these institutions are often able to offer more personalized help and have better knowledge of your local real estate market and its norms. The best way to find the right fit for you is to apply with multiple lenders. That way, you can compare service, costs, and beneficial features before deciding which one you want to work with. Some mortgage lenders are better for certain borrowers or situations than others. For example, we think Rocket Mortgage is a good lender for refinancing because it offers the ability to customize your term length, which allows you to avoid resetting your loan term. In our guide to thebest mortgage lenders for first-time homebuyers, Bank of America was our top pick. A good lender for first-time buyers should offer loans and features specifically geared toward these borrowers. Look for lenders that have low-down-payment mortgages and offer additional help like down payment grants. We have guides to the best lenders for each of the three main types of government-backed mortgages. Lenders will ask for many differentdocuments when you apply for a mortgage, so it's a good idea to have them ready to go ahead of time. This will likely include paystubs, W-2s or 1099s, tax returns, bank statements and other asset account statements, and any other documentation showing your income and savings. Typically, the mortgage application process starts with a preapproval. With this kind of approval, the lender will take a look at your credit and finances and tell you how much it is willing to lend you based on the information it looked at. You'll use your preapproval to shop for homes and make offers. Once you have an offer accepted, you'll apply for approval. The lender may ask for more documentation at this stage, including a copy of your signed purchase contract. Once you're approved, you'll receive a loan estimate with all the details of your proposed mortgage, including estimated closing costs. If you decide to move forward, the lender will begin processing and underwriting your loan. It will order anappraisalto make sure the home is worth what you've agreed to pay for it, and underwriters will work to verify that you meet the lender's standards and can afford the loan. If all goes well, you'll receive final approval and be cleared to close. Our top pick mortgage lender is Bank of America, but that doesn't mean it's the best bank for you to get a mortgage from. The best mortgage lender for you is the one that you qualify with that offers the type of mortgage you're looking for and can give you the best deal in terms of its interest rates and fees. For the lender with the lowest mortgage rates, we recommend Better Mortgage based on its average rates in 2023, but you might find lower rates elsewhere depending on your individual financial situation. Take a look atBusiness Insider's daily mortgage rate updatesto see the average mortgage rates for various term lengths. Yes. You shouldapply for preapprovalwith more than one mortgage lender to compare the rates and features you're being offered to make sure you're getting the best deal. Some lenders charge a fee to apply for a mortgage. This fee can cost as much as $500 up front and is typically nonrefundable. Not all lenders charge the same fees, which is why it's important to consider not only the rate a lender is offering you but the overall cost as well. Yes, you can switch mortgage lenders before closing, and it may help you save if you find a better deal elsewhere. But this can cause closing delays or cost you money (if, for example, you need to get a new appraisal), so be sure to consider all the pros and cons. To help you learn more about homebuying, mortgages, and lenders, four experts weighed in: Here's their advice about how to evaluate mortgage lenders, and how to decide which type of mortgage is best for you. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What factors should someone take into consideration when choosing a mortgage lender? Anthony Park, author: \"The canned answer is to just go with the lowest rate. However, you also want to take into account who's going to serve your loan best. Are repayments going to be easy for you? Who is most likely to be able to help you if you need to take out a HELOC or refinance later, versus somebody who's more of a one-off type? \"They may have the lowest rates to get you involved, but they might have very, very little hand holding after the fact. I wouldn't recommend paying an exorbitant amount more for potential services in the future, but just don't always necessarily go with the rock-bottom lowest rate. There's sometimes a cost with that.\" Molly Grace, Business Insider: \"Remember that you're not just choosing a mortgage lender — you're also building a homebuying team. To snag the home you want in this competitive market, you need a lender that can move quickly and has good communication with you and your real estate agent. When I was looking for a house, I was able to text my loan officer (whom my real estate agent recommended) and get quick replies when I had questions or needed an updated preapproval letter for an offer. As you compare lenders, pay attention to how responsive they are, and ask your agent if they have any experience with the lenders you're considering.\" How can someone decide between a conventional mortgage vs. a government-backed mortgage? Molly Grace, Business Insider \"AnFHA mortgageis a really helpful option for borrowers with low scores or kind of rocky credit histories. But if you have great credit, you may get a better rate and pay less for mortgage insurance on a conventional mortgage. VA mortgagesare really great deals. If you qualify for one, you should definitely go for it. You get zero down with no mortgage insurance — plus some of the best rates available.\" Julie Aragon, Aragon Lending Team: \"The most common government loan that's widely available to almost everyone is the FHA loan. There's a couple of reasons why somebody would go with FHA instead of conventional one. Their credit is a little on the crummy side, let's say below 700. You can get conventional with down to a 620 score, but the mortgage insurance gets really expensive. FHA doesn't discriminate — no matter how perfect or crappy your credit is, the mortgage insurance is the same.\" How can someone know whether they're financially ready to buy a home? Lauryn Williams, CFP: \"You should have funds left over after everything is said and done as it pertains to purchasing the home. So if you don't have anemergency fundplusa down payment, you're probably not ready to purchase a home. Another thing I think about is credit card debt. While you can be approved for a mortgage with credit card debt and student loans and very little cash on hand, you put yourself in a very risky situation.\" Molly Grace, Business Insider \"You have to be ready to dedicate a chunk of your budget to homeownership — and I don't mean your mortgage payment. When you own your house, there's always something that needs taking care of, especially in the first year. We got to our new house on moving day to find that the A/C was out. We paid $700 to have it fixed.\" Methodology: How Did We Choose the Best Mortgage Lenders?

High-yield savings accounts are a good place to keep emergency money or savings for things you want to accomplish in a short timeframe. TheFederal Reserve cut interest rates in December, which has influenced national savings rate declines. Another Fed meeting is taking place on January 28 and 29, which could also influence further savings rate fluctuations. That said, high-yield savings accounts are still worth opening regardless of market conditions because they pay more than traditional savings accounts. We report on the highest-yielding savings account rates currently available.

Our top picks for savings accounts are federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Federal insurance protects up to $250,000 per depositor in the event of a bank failure. Here are the best high-yield savings accounts as picked by Business Insider editors in 2025. TheDCU Primary Savings Accountis one of twosavings accounts that pays 6% interest. The other account is Boeing Employees Credit Union Member Advantage Savings, which pays 6.17% APY on the first $500 when you meet certain requirements. You can earn 6.17% APY on balances up to $1,000 withDCU Primary Savings Account. If you have an account balance above $1,000, theinterestrate drops to 0.15% APY. This account doesn't charge monthly service fees. To open the Digital Federal Credit Union Primary Savings Account, you'll have to meet certain membership eligibility requirements. You must live in select areas of Massachusetts, live in a New Hampshire participating condominium community, work for a Select Employer Group, or belong to a local participating organization. Digital Federal Credit Union currently has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. The credit union hasn't been involved in any recent public controversies. The Varo Savings Account is one of the last high yield savings accounts to offer 2.50% to 5.00% APY. It also comes with automatic savings tools that automatically transfer money from your paychecks and purchases to your savings account, if you choose to use them. You'll need to meet some requirements to earn the highest APY, though. First, you'll need to get at least $1,000 in direct deposits each month and end the month with a positive balance in all of your Varo bank accounts. Then, you'll earn the high APY — but only on the first $5,000 in your account. You'll earn a much lower rate on any money over that $5,000. Varo has anA- ratingfrom the BBB because of the large number of complaints filed against the bank. it has no recent controversies. Varo Bank Review The Axos ONE Savings and Checking Bundle is a hybrid savings account and checking account, which means you can't open an Axos ONE savings account without an Axos ONE checking account. You could earn a high rate with the Axos ONE Savings and Checking Bundle; your savings account balance can earn up to up to 4.86% APY, while your checking account balance can earn up to 0.51% APY. The account also comes with other perks, likeearly direct depositand enhanced FDIC coverage. In order to earn a good interest rate, you'll need to receive at least $1,500 in direct deposits before the 25th of the month. You'll also need to maintain an average daily balance of $1,500. If you can't meet those requirements, you'll only earn 1.00% APY on your savings balance, and you won't earn any interest at all on your checking balance. Axos Bank has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. It does not have any recent controversies. Axos Bank Review Pibank Savingsoffers one of the highest-yield savings account rate nationally. This account pays 4.75% APY, has a $0 minimum opening deposit, and no monthly service fees. If you haven't heard of Pibank before, it's an online brand of Intercredit Bank, a financial institution in Miami. While this account offer a competitive interest rate and has relatively flexible opening requirements, there a couple of downsides to take note of. Pibank Savings doesn't support payments through Bill Pay or Zelle. You also may be charged fees by your external financial institution for outgoing and incoming wire transfers. The BBB gave Intercredit Bank anA+ rating. Pibank hasn't received an individual rating from the BBB yet. TheOpenbank High Yield Savingshas a high savings account interest rate of 4.75% (vary depending on location) APY. It doesn't charge any monthly service fees, either. TheOpenbank High Yield Savingscomes with some downsides that might not make it a good choice for you. You'll only be able to bank using Openbank's mobile banking app, and you'll need a phone that has either fingerprint or face recognition technology. If you don't have a phone with those features or don't want to use those features, you'll want to go with a different bank. You might also struggle to get money in and out of the account; you won't have access to ATMs or mobile check deposit with this account, and Openbank doesn't have a checking account you can transfer your money into easily. Openbank does not have a rating from the BBB. Its parent bank, Santander Bank, has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. Neither Openbank nor Santander Bank have recent controversies. Openbank Savings Account Review TheNewtek Bank Personal High Yield Savings Accountis one of the highest interest savings accounts you can find nationally. It also has a $0 minimum opening deposit. Newtek Bank also has one of thebest 6-month CD rates. Newtek Bank received anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. Newtek Bank doesn't have a personal checking account, and you can't get a debit card or ATM card with a high-yield savings account. If you need to withdraw money, you'll have to transfer it to an external bank account. Newtek Bank Savings Review TheBrioDirect High-Yield Savings Accountoffers a competitive rate of 4.55% APY and doesn't charge monthly maintenance fees. You might consider another bank if you'd like to open a high-yield savings account with a low minimum opening deposit. The BrioDirect High-Yield Savings Account requires $5,000 to open an account. The BBB also gave BrioDirect's parent company, Webster Bank, aB- ratingbecause it received numerous customer complaints and hasn't resolved one of the complaints. Webster Bank has also been involved in a recent controversy. In January 2024, Webster paid$1.4 million in a settlementover a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit was over a ransomware attack on Webster Bank that resulted in some customers of the bank having their personal information stolen. BrioDirect Review Popular Direct Savingsis a good choice if you'd like to open an account with one of thebest online banksfor savings. Popular Direct offers high interest rates for a high-yield savings account and CDs.Popular Direct Savingsalso stands out because it has no monthly service fee. There's a couple of downsides to banking with Popular Direct, though. For one, the bank has high minimum opening deposit requirements. For instance, the high-yield savings account requires a minimum of $100 to opened. That's more than some of the other banks on our list. Popular Direct has no checking account. You'll have to transfer money to an external account, which may not be very convenient since it could take a couple business days to process transactions. Lastly, Popular Direct's mobile app has poor ratings in the Apple and Google Play store. You'll likely prefer one of the other banks on our list if that's a priority for you. Popular Direct has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. However, it's been involved in one recent public controversy. In 2023, theFederal Reserve Board fined Popular Direct's parent bank, Popular Bank, $2.3 million. The Federal Reserve Board said the fine was because Popular Bank processed six Paycheck Protection Program loans that had significant signs of potential fraud. Popular Direct Review Bask Bank has a high-yield savings account with a $0 minimum deposit, so it could be a good option if you'd like to open an account with easy opening requirements. You might consider Bask Bank if you're interested in opening CDs, too. The online-only bank is also featured in our guide for thebest 3-month CD rates. To deposit or withdraw money, you'll need to link an external bank account and initiate a bank transfer. Bask Bank also received aB ratingfrom the BBB because it's received various customer complaints on the BBB website. However, its parent company, Texas Capital Bank, has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. Bask Bank Review TheBarclays Tiered Savingsaccount pays a great interest rate if you can meet the requirements, and there's a $0 minimum deposit and no monthly maintenance fee. You can also get a bonus of $200 if you open a new account and meet the requirements, which include depositing and keeping a balance of $25,000 in the account for a certain amount of time. To earn the highest interest rate, you'll need to have at least $250,000 in your account. You'll still earn a good interest rate if you can't meet that requirement, but the lower rate isn't as good as what our other top picks offer. Additionally, FDIC insurance doesn't cover amounts over $250,000 for single depositors, so you'll have to be OK with some of your money being uninsured — or try to keep the money in your account at exactly $250,000 — if you want to earn the highest rate. The bank has been involved in one recent public controversy. In 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission required Barclays to pay $361 million in a settlement that accused the bank of having unregistered sales of securities. The Better Business Bureau gives Barclays anA+ rating. Barclays Savings Review High-yield savings accounts are a type of bank account. You can distinguish them from traditional savings accounts because they pay a higher yield. That's because they're generally offered by online banks and credit unions, so these financial institutions don't generally have to pay for all of the expenses that brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions do. Besides its ability to earn more interest, a high-yield savings account is structurally similar to a traditional savings account. It still has FDIC or NCUA insurance, and you need to pay attention to minimum opening requirements, minimum balance requirements for earning interest, and common bank fees. Higher Interest Rates Than Traditional Savings Accounts A traditional savings account from a brick-and-mortar financial institution typically pays a low interest rate. For example, big banks like Chase and Bank of America pay less than 0.05% APY on their standard savings account. You'll earn significantly more with a high-yield savings account. The highest savings rates land between 4% to 5% APY. Safe and Secure Like other bank accounts, almost all high-yield savings accounts are either FDIC-insured or NCUA-insured, depending on whether you're banking with a bank or a credit union, respectively. This means your money will be ensured up to $250,000 for an individual bank account or up to $500,000 for ajoint bank account. Ideal for Growing Your Money High-yield savings accounts can be great for when you want to earn some money on your savings without risk and while still having easy access to it. This makes it ideal foremergency funds; you don't want to risk your emergency funds on investing, and you want to be able to access your emergency funds if something major happens. With high-yield savings accounts, you'll still be able to make money off your money without sacrificing safety and access. A savings account rate is variable, which means it can fluctuate after it is opened. Your bank will usually email you to tell you the rate will go up or down soon. Savings accounts may also have transfer limits, according to federal rule Regulation D. Generally, if a savings account has a transfer limit, this means that you'll only be permitted to make six transfers from the account each month. If you exceed the transfer limit, you will have to pay a fee for each additional transfer. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve has recentlyamended Regulation D, so banks may choose to suspend the monthly transfer limit so customers can make unlimited monthly transactions, or they could enforce a six-per-month limit. There are sixtypes of savings accounts: traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, cash management accounts, and specialty savings accounts. The best savings account for you depends on your banking preferences, goals, and when you'll need to access your money. A high-yield savings account, for example, is a strong choice if you're comfortable with banking digitally and want to obtain a high interest rate. Depending on where you bank, some savings accounts may chargemonthly bank maintenance fees. A monthly service fee is an amount you'll have to pay each month to maintain an account. Some accounts will allow you to waive a monthly service fee if you meet certain requirements, while others cannot be waived. Bear in mind that some savings accounts do not charge certain fees at all. Some banks will require you to keep some money in your savings account to get the highest savings account interest rate. Savings account promotions are also more common in a competitive interest rate environment. You might see some companies pay a bonus rate for a new account for the first couple of months. These specials are to attract new customers. To make sure you're getting a top rate, find out what the interest rate will be once the promotion is over so you know there isn't a significant decline in APY. You should also factor in the overall customer experience at the bank. High-yield savings accounts are more commonly found at online banks. You might find some brick-and-mortar financial institutions with these accounts, or a few institutions that offer a hybrid experience, but for the most part, be prepared for a primarily digital banking experience. Somebanks offer 24/7 customer supportby phone or through live chat, so you may look into these options if traditional banking hours don't work well with your schedule. You can also check abank holiday scheduleto see if it has a flexible branch calendar. Some banks are open on holidays when other banks aren't, or they'll stay open for longer while other banks may close early before a holiday weekend. If you value strong mobile banking, you might prefer a bank with one of thebest mobile banking apps. It should also be noted that some smaller local institutions and new online banking divisions don't have mobile apps for their high-yield savings accounts. That could be a disadvantage because that's one less way to manage your account. Accessibility for cash deposits and withdrawals also varies widely between online banks. A handful ofhigh-yield savings accounts have debit cards or ATM cards, but for the most part, this isn't a common feature. Typically, you'll need to own a checking account with the same bank or make an external bank account transfer to take out cash. Depositing cash through a high-yield savings account can also involve extra steps, depending on the bank. Some banks do not let you make cash deposits on online high-yield savings accounts, so you have to deposit cash to the bank's checking account or to an external bank account from a different bank and then transfer money. A couple of online banks may have more ways for making cash deposits. For example, a few let you make cash deposits at ATMs in their network. You also might be able cash deposits at stores — usually there's a fee of around $5 per transaction, though. The interest rate isn't the only thing that matters in a high-yield savings account. When choosing an account, make sure you can afford the minimum deposit. You should also check whether there is a monthly service fee — and if so, find out if you qualify to waive it — or any requirements to earn the highest interest rate. It may also be helpful to look at what the requirements are for opening a savings account at a particular financial institution. Some banks allowimmigrants and non-U.S. citizens to open an accountwith a Matricula Consular or foreign passport instead of a U.S. ID. You can also open a second chance bank account, which doesn't use ChexSystems to review your banking history. These may be options to consider if you're struggling to open a bank account at a financial institution. Some institutions also limit the number of monthly withdrawals/transfers you can make from your high-yield savings account before charging you a fee. You want an account that will result in a high interest rate and few to no fees so you can earn as much as possible. You'll also want to consider accounts tailored to your specific circumstances; for example, if you're in the military, you might want a savings account from one of thebest military banks. Generally, you'll find the best nationwide savings interest rates at online banks. That said, a local credit union currently offers the highest interest rate on a savings account overall. You may get 6.17% APY on up to $1,000 in your savings if you join Digital Federal Credit Union. Membership, however, is limited to people who live in select areas of Massachusetts, live in a New Hampshire participating condominium community, work for a Select Employer Group, or belong to a local participating organization. Theaverage savings accountin the United States offers 0.41% APY. If you're more comfortable banking with a brick-and-mortar bank, a traditional savings account might be a better option for you. Just know that you may not be getting the best possible interest rate because online banks andcredit unionsusually offer higher rates. Once you're ready, you can apply for a high-yield savings account online. Typically, the bank will specify whether you can apply for individual and joint bank account, and if there are any age requirements to open a high-yield savings account. Some banks will only let you open a high-interest savings account if you're at least 18 years old. The application for opening a savings account requires basic information and proof of identity like your full name, home address, and job information. Online forms also generally require your Social Security number and driver's license information, although some banks let you use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number instead of a Social Security number. You might also need to share copies of these documents if a bank asks for it. Some permit an alternative ID if you don't have a U.S. ID, like a foreign passport or Matricula Consular. Once you're approved to open an account, you'll be able to deposit money to a high-yield savings account. Some banks don't require an initial deposit, but if yours does, you can link an external bank account and make anACH transferas a funding method. If you choose an in-person bank, you might be able to deposit money at a branch as a funding method. If you'd like to have help opening a savings account, you can generally open a savings account at an in-person bank branch if your bank has it, or you can open an account over the phone. To maximize your earnings with a high-yield savings account, shop around to find one that pays a high rate and doesn't charge monthly service or excess withdrawal fees for taking money out regularly. You may find it helpful to set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your high-yield savings account. If you receive your paycheck as a direct deposit, you can also ask your employer to send a percentage of your paycheck to your high-yield savings account each pay period. As your balance grows with automatic savings and direct deposits, you'll earn more interest. If you're looking for ways onhow to save moneyand be more consistent with your habits, consider the following tips: A savings account's purpose is to give you a safe place to save money over time. If you're racking up bank fees or having a tough time managing your account, then your savings account isn't serving you. Write down the pros and cons of your current savings account, and explore other options to see if you can find a better fit. Another thing to keep in mind is that savings accounts aren't necessarily the best place to keep money for long-term financial goals. If you have a long-term goal and are comfortable taking on some risk, you can earn higher returns if youinvest in stocks. Once you have a savings account, don't forget that you'll need to report your interest as taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service when you're filing your tax return. You'll have to file a Form 1099-INT, which will ask you to report your interest earnings during the year. TheFederal Reserveis the central banking system of the U.S. It sets its own interest rates based on current economic conditions, taking into account things like inflation and employment. It meets several times a year, and when it meets, it announces whether it's decided to raise interest rates, lower interest rates, or keep interest rates the same. Whatever the Fed does, banks and credit unions usually follow suit. If the Fed lowers rates, you're likely to see lower savings account rates, but if it raises its rates, then you're likely to see higher savings rates too. Savings rates hit a historic high in 2023 following years of the Fed raising rates, topping out around 5.5% APY. In comparison, between 2014 and 2021, the highest the Fed ever set its rates was 2.5%. Historical savings rates follow similar patterns to historical Fed rates. In late 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered rates for the first time after closing in on rate of inflation and unemployment targets. Since then, the Fed lowered rates three times in 2024. While rates are still high — Fed rates are currently targeted at 4.25% to 4.50% — we're likely to continue seeing interest rate decline in the coming years. Interest rates on high-interest savings accounts closely follow the federal funds rate. This means rates are variable and can change several times per year at the whim of the Federal Reserve. Keeping track of when thenext Fed meetingwill happen and whether rates can change can help you better understand fluctuations in high-yield savings account rates. If the interest rate on your savings account drops significantly, you may decide to look at other financial institutions to see if you can find a more competitive interest rate elsewhere. Typically, online banks and credit unions offer the highest interest rates for savings accounts. However, bear in mind that changing accounts may not be worth the effort, particularly if your new account's rate drops afterward. You also might consider other types of savings account options. For example, buying savings bonds or comparingCDs vs high-yield savings accountsmay be worth doing if you've already established your emergency fund. Thebest CD ratesare comparable to the best high-yield savings account rates. You might prefer a CD if you want to lock in a high rate for a set period of time, since CDs offer fixed rates. You won't risk your rate decreasing as you would with a savings account. But CDs offer less flexibility. You can't put more money into a CD after the initial opening deposit, and you'll pay a penalty if you take out money before the term ends. So, if you open a3-year CD, you won't be able to take your money out of the CD until three years have passed without paying early withdrawal penalties. That being said, something like aCD ladder, which is where you buy multiple CDs with different term lengths, could give you more liquidity while still letting you lock in good rates. If you're trying to decide between CDs versus high-yield savings accounts, your choice could come down to when you need to deposit and/or withdraw money. (We also have a full explanation of howno-penalty CDs compare to savings accounts.) Money market accountsare similar to high-yield savings accounts, but they typically make it easier to access your savings. The best money market accounts come with features checking accounts might have, such as an ATM card, debit card, or paper checks. Thebest high-yield checking accountsare great tools for earning even more interest on your money. But checking account balances are often lower than savings account balances because you use them to spend money. If you're serious about using interest to grow your balance, a high-yield savings account is usually the better bet. APYstands for annual percentage yield. The APY of a savings account will tell you how much money you'll earn in a year, factoring in compound interest. Digital Federal Credit Union is currently the top high-yield savings account for earning interest. It pays 6.17% APY on balances up to $1,000. Credit Union membership is limited to people who live in select areas of Massachusetts, live in a New Hampshire participating condominium community, work for a Select Employer Group, or belong to a local participating organization. Thesavings rate forecast for 2025indicates rates are expected to decline throughout the year. Savings account rates peaked, and as market conditions change, it's expected that banks will steadily lower rates in response to Fed rate cuts. It's safe to keep all of your money in a high-yield savings account if your balance is $250,000 or less (for an individual account) or $500,000 or less (in a joint account). The FDIC and NCUA insure up to $250,000 per owner, per category. Soif your bank fails, all of your insured money would be safe. If you have more than the FDIC or NCUA would insure, consider opening a second account at another institution or investing some money if it makes sense for you. The best high-yield savings accounts offer an APY of 5%. With 5% APY, you would have $10,500 in your account at the end of one year. The benefits of a high-yield savings account are that you can earn a high interest rate on your money while still being able to access it if you need to. Your money is also safe in a high-yield savings account, as it is FDIC-insured up to $250,000 for a single-owner bank account and $500,000 for a joint-owner account. Some fees associated with high-yield savings accounts include monthly maintenance fees, excess transaction fees, paper statement fees, and inactivity fees. You can choose the best high-yield savings account by analyzing fees, customer service availability, online and mobile banking features, and other features that impact your overall banking experience. It may also help you to think about whether you are interested in potentially getting other bank accounts or services in the future. Some banks let you easily access money in your high-yield savings account because they have physical locations or offer multiple ways to make deposits or withdrawals. Others might not offer many ways to access your money, so you'll have to rely a lot on transferring money to external bank accounts, which can be tedious. The best high-yield savings accounts pay at least 4.55% APY. In one year, 4.55% APY on $1,000 would add around $46 to your account. Currently, Digital Federal Credit Union offers the highest APY for a high-yield savings account, but it only offers that rate for the first $1,000 in the account. If you want to put more in your high-yield savings account, you might want to consider banks like BrioDirect. Yes, the interest rate on your savings account will most likely change. Interest rates on savings accounts are variable, meaning they can and will change regularly and without advance notice.

Here's what our expert panel had to say about high-interest savings accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) Generally, what makes a high-yield savings account good or not good? Roger Ma, CFP® professional with and author of\"Work Your Money, Not Your Life\": \"It might not be as seamless to get your money out of an online savings account as it is a brick-and-mortar, but you don't want to have so much friction where it's such a pain to get the money out when you need it.\" Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: \"Anything with a fee is not a good high-yield savings account. Anything that restricts how much you can save is, to me, not very good. If I can't save more than $10,000 in this account, and then I have to move it over somewhere else — to me, that's not a really good savings account, because it's not really prepared to help me expand and grow, which is what a savings account is supposed to do. I also look at interest rates, definitely. I look to see when the interest is paid. Is it quarterly, or is it monthly? How often do they pay out interest, and what are the interest rate stipulations?\" Sophia Acevedo, banking editor, Business Insider: \"I would consider looking for features that will help manage your account. Some banks have high-yield savings accounts that let you separate your savings into individual goals and track your progress. Other financial institutions will let you deposit cash at ATMs or some retailers. A good high-yield savings account will likely be an account where you can grow your savings without unnecessary hassles.\" How should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD? Tania Brown, CFP® professional, vice president of coaching strategy atOfColor: \"So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.\" Sophia Acevedo, Business Insider: \"I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly service fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I'm searching for an interest-earning bank account, I'll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account.\" There are many high-yield savings accounts available across financial institutions. Through our research, we've found that the best high-yield savings accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence, robo-advisors, and other internet-only financial companies. If you're more comfortable banking with a national brick-and-mortar bank, you'll likely have to consider a premium savings account to earn a more competitive interest rate.

The details for these products have not been reviewed or provided by the issuer.  If you're carrying credit card debt, you can reduce high interest by transferring your outstanding balance to a credit card that offers a period of zero interest when you first open the account, also called a 0% intro APR. A 0% intro APR isn't a license to splurge. Be sure to use your credit card responsibly, and avoid spending more than you can afford to prevent incurring even more debt. Many balance transfer credit cards offer no-interest periods for new purchases as well as balances transferred from other debt. Others only offer a 0% intro APR on balance transfers, so make sure you read the fine print to avoid unpleasant surprises.

The Chase Slate Edge℠ doesn't earn cardholders rewards on purchases, or offer a welcome bonus. But that's not the point of the card. This card is geared toward folks looking to improve their financial situation and increase their credit score. With the Chase Slate Edge℠, you'll get a great 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 18 months from account opening (then a 20.49% - 29.24% Variable APR). So if you're looking for 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases, this card is definitely worth considering. Moreover, you can receive an automatic, one-time review of your credit for the chance of a higher limit. But you'll first need to consistently pay on time and spend at least $500 in the first six months of opening the card. On each account anniversary, you'll be considered for a 2% APR reduction, as long as you've paid your card on time and spent at least $1,000 on purchases in the previous anniversary year. The reduction is capped, though — it will only be reduced until your APR reaches the Prime Rate plus 9.74% (Prime Rate is 7.50% as of 12/19/2024). Learn more about this card in ourChase Slate Edge review. Theaverage credit card interest rateis over 20%, and can be significantly higher depending on your credit score and the card you're using. The last thing you want to do is find yourself in the quicksand of credit card interest. Before you decide to use a 0% intro APR credit card, be sure you have the means and a plan to pay off your balance in full before the introductory APR period ends. Otherwise, you'll have to pay interest on your remaining balance. If you don't think you'll be able to pay off your debt in full by the time the introductory APR offer expires, a balance transfer credit card may not be worth it. A balance transfer credit card allows people with existing debt to move their outstanding balance over from another card to avoid interest fees. You can avoid interest on a balance transfer card thanks to an intro 0% APR offer, which lasts anywhere from nine to 21 months. After this introductory period is over, your APR will reset to the standard variable rate, so you must pay off your credit card debt in full before the intro APR period ends to avoid paying hefty interest charges. What's the catch? One disadvantage is that balance transfer credit cards typically charge an upfront fee of 3% or 5% of your balance, or a flat fee of $300 to $500 for every $10,000 in high-interest debt you transfer. If you don't need to transfer a balance but need to make a large purchase that you'll need time to pay off, see our list of thebest zero interest credit cards. The good thing about balance transfer credit cards is that you can get more time to pay off an existing balance without incurring sky-high interest fees. Balance transfers also allow you to consolidate credit card debt into one card, which makes it easier to manage your payments without anything slipping through the cracks. And, as mentioned above, opening a balance transfer card can improve your credit score by lowering your credit utilization ratio, provided you don't use up the line of credit on your new card. On the downside, most balance transfer cards come with a balance transfer fee — usually 3% to 5% of the amount you're transferring. The other huge potential drawback is that if you don't pay off your total balance before the promotional APR period ends, you'll end up paying high interest rates. So you'll want to make sure it's feasible to pay down your balance before the intro APR offer ends. Our credit card experts reviewed Reddit and other popular online forums to see what current cardholders had to say about balance transfer credit cards. Balance transfer fees typically vary between 3% to 5%, and different cards charge different fees. In some cases, you may even receive a lower transfer fee rate early on when you first open the card. Cardholders say that balance transfer fees are significantly more affordable than the high interest rate accrued from credit card debt, and well worth paying if you have the option of doing so. If you have a choice between several different credit cards, opt for the one with the lowest balance transfer fee to save yourself some money. Most balance transfer credit card applications require good to excellent credit for approval. If you have a lower credit score, you may need to focus on a card like the Chase Slate Edge℠ for the time being, and use it responsibly to boost your credit in order to qualify for better products in future. If you qualify forNavy Federal Credit Unionmembership, look at an NFCU credit card such as the Navy Federal Credit Union Platinum Credit Card or the Navy Federal Credit Union GO REWARDS® Credit Card, which offer 0% intro APR or 0.99% intro APR deals from time to time (then a 11.24% - 18.00% Variable and 14.49% - 18.00% Variable APR, respectively). While these cards typically offer shorter interest-free periods and less benefits than those featured in ourbest credit cardsguide, they do not charge balance transfer fees. If you are confident you can pay off your balance in a few months, transferring your debt to an NFCU card can save you some interest. A balance transfer credit card allows you to move a high-interest credit card balance from another card to your new credit card. The best credit cards for balance transfers don't charge any interest for up to 21 months at a time, which can help you save money on interest and pay down your balance more quickly. Not all balance transfer credit cards offer the same benefits for new purchases. So if you need a 0% intro APR credit card for new purchases, check out our guide to thebest zero-interest credit cardsavailable right now. Balance transfer credit cards offer benefits such as low or 0% introductory APR periods, which can significantly reduce interest payments on existing debt. They help consolidate multiple debts into one manageable payment and can save you money on interest over time. To maximize benefits, transfer your high-interest balances as soon as possible, make consistent payments to pay down your debt within the introductory period, and avoid new purchases on the card to prevent accumulating additional debt. Always read the terms and conditions to understand fees and rate changes. Potential downsides include balance transfer fees, which are typically a percentage of the amount transferred, and the risk of accumulating more debt if you don't manage your spending. Additionally, the 0% APR period is temporary, and interest rates will increase afterward. Some balance transfer credit cards offer rewards programs, allowing you to earn cash back, points, or miles on new purchases. However, it's important to prioritize paying off your transferred balance over earning rewards to avoid interest charges. Look for a card with a long 0% APR introductory period, low balance transfer fees, and reasonable ongoing APR rates. Also, consider any additional benefits such as rewards programs, no annual fees, and other perks that add value to the card. Balance transfer cards allow you to pay lower interest rates on existing credit card debt, which can save you a significant amount of money in a short amount of time. With a balance transfer credit card, you'll pay a 3% to 5% fee per transaction to transfer existing debt from an existing card. A balance transfer credit card could help you escape credit card debt if you make a plan to pay it off. Transferring your outstanding balance from a high-interest credit card to one with a 0% intro APR period can give you some financial breathing room. But they're only effective if you pay off the full outstanding balance before the intro period ends; otherwise, you'll start paying high interest once more. To complete a balance transfer, you'll first have to apply and get approved for a balance transfer credit card. Once you have a card with an introductory APR offer on balance transfers, you'll need to initiate the transfer through the bank that issues your new balance transfer credit card. You can usually complete this process online, or by calling the number on the back of your 0% intro APR credit card. A balance transfer generally takes five to seven days, but the actual time can vary by issuer. Your bank may ask you to allow up to 21 days for a balance transfer to go through, but the transfer should usually be completed sooner. Balance transfer credit cards usually require at least agood credit scoreto qualify. If you havebad credit— typically defined as aFICO scorebelow 670 — you probably won't be approved for a balance transfer card. A bank may be less inclined to approve you for a balance transfer card if your credit score and credit report indicate that you haven't consistently paid off past debts. Balance transfers can affect your credit both positively and negatively. Opening a balance transfer credit card can help your credit score by increasing your total available credit, which in turn improves your credit utilization rate. Paying down your debt will also be beneficial to your credit score. However, opening a new credit card triggers a hard inquiry on your credit report, which can decrease your credit score in the short term. You'll also pay a 3% to 5% balance transfer fee, which adds to your existing debt.

It's also a safe bet if you want to use it while traveling internationally — it doesn't charge pesky foreign transaction fees, so you won't be on the hook for extra charges if you use it overseas. However, you won't find many extras — like travel benefits or purchase protections — with this card. If you're looking for better benefits, be sure to check out our guide to thebest student credit cardsfor all the top options. What the experts love:Impressive welcome bonus offer for a student credit card, good flat-rate rewards earning What the experts don't love:No flashy extra perks or shopping benefits Read more:Bank of America® Travel Rewards Credit Card for Students review The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card offers a massive welcome bonus of 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening — worth at least $1,275 in travel, based on Business Insider's valuation of Capital One miles. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is loaded with premium benefits that can more than offset the $395 annual fee. For context, this annual fee is significantly lower than that of other premium travel cards which offer airport lounge access. Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card cardholders also receive $300 per year in credits toward travel booked through Capital One; Priority Pass and Capital One airport lounge access (even for authorized users, for free); a 10,000-mile bonus on each account anniversary (worth $100 in travel); and Visa Infinite travel and purchase benefits. Through the Capital One Premier Collection, Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card cardholders can access hundreds of premium hotels and resorts worldwide and receive elite-like benefits such as free breakfast, room upgrades, and on-property credits. As with other cards thatearn Capital One miles, you can transfer rewards to over a dozen airline and hotel partners to book award travel or use miles to book through theCapital One Travel Portal. What the experts love:Between $300 a year in travel credit and a 10,000-mile bonus on each account anniversary, you can offset the annual fee entirely — and that's not even considering other benefits like lounge access What the experts don't love:The $300 travel credit is more restrictive than that offered from other cards, and only applies to travel booked through Capital One Read more:Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card review The American Express® Gold Card is an ideal travel card for anyone who frequently eats out and/or shops at U.S. supermarkets. You'll earn 4 Membership Rewards® points on purchases at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 4 points at US supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 3 points on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com, 2 points on prepaid hotels and other eligible purchases booked on AmexTravel.com, and 1 point on all other eligible purchases. You can get up to $120 in annual dining credits after enrollment, but it's divided into up to $10 in credits each month, and the credit only applies at select restaurants and delivery services at Grubhub, The Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and Five Guys. You'll also get up to $120 Uber Cash ($10 per month) credit each calendar year. This is only applicable to U.S. Eats orders and rides, and the American Express® Gold Card needs to be added as a method of payment to the Uber app to receive the Uber Cash benefit. What the experts love:4 points on restaurantsandat U.S. supermarkets (on up to $50,000 and up to $25,000 per year, respectively), plus monthly dining credits What the experts don't love:Other cards offer similar benefits for a lower annual fee, and the card's travel and dining credits have some important limitations, so read the fine print Read more:American Express® Gold Card review The Chase Sapphire Reserve® has a $550 annual fee, which means it's not for everybody. But if you're serious about maximizing your rewards and you travel frequently, this card can be worth the annual fee. It offers a bonus of 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. Not only do you get up to $300 in statement credits toward travel each year (and Chase has a very generous definition of travel — including everything from airfare to highway tolls), but you also earn 5x total points on air travel and 10x total points on hotels and car rentals purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards (excluding the $300 travel credit) and 3x points on all other travel and dining. You also get airport lounge access through the Priority Pass network, which has more than 1,300 locations worldwide. New benefits also include access toChase Sapphire loungesin JFK, LaGuardia, Boston, and Hong Kong, as well as the Chase Sapphire Terrace in the Austin airport. You'll also receive monthly DoorDash benefits that can save you money on delivery (activation required). The Chase Sapphire Reserve® is currently offering cardholders two years of complimentary Lyft Pink All Access membership (valued at $199 per year) for member-exclusive pricing, priority pickup, and more (activation required). When redeeming points, you can book travel through Chase and get 1.5 cents per point (a 50% bonus over the standard 1-cent-per-point rate), or you can transfer your Chase Ultimate Rewards to travel partners like Hyatt, British Airways, and United. Plus, like the less-expensive Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® offers some of thebest credit card travel insurancearound. This includes primary car rental insurance, trip delay insurance, trip cancellation protection, and lost baggage insurance. What the experts love:3x points on travel and dining purchases made outside the Chase Travel℠ Portal, annual $300 travel credit, and points are worth 1.5 cents apiece when booking travel through Chase What the experts don't love:You have to squeeze every drop of value out of this card to make that jaw-dropping $550 annual fee worth your while Read more:Chase Sapphire Reserve® review Expert Insight:The Chase Sapphire Reserve® card was previously our pick for the best travel card overall, before the annual fee increased from $450 to $550. While the Reserve did add some additional benefits, the Reserve no longer makes as much sense for casual travelers. As a result, we now recommend the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card as the best travel credit card for most people. The Platinum Card® from American Express has one of the highest annual fees of any travel card. But it can still be well worth it if you can utilize most or all of the card's statement credits and generous welcome bonus. You'll earn 5x points on flights when you book directly through the airline or throughAmerican Express Travel(on up to $500,000 per calendar year), which makes the card a great choice for purchasing airfare. The card offersAmerican Express travel protectionlike trip cancellation and interruption insurance, plus some of the best purchase protection, so it's a good option for buying expensive items (and don't forget to see if you can take advantage of enrolling in anAmex Offerfor bonus points or cash back). The Platinum Card® from American Express offers moreairport lounge accessthan any other personal travel card — in addition to Priority Pass membership (enrollment required), you get access toAmex Centurion Lounges,Delta Sky Clubs(when you're flying Delta), and more. The card's annual statement credits can go a long way toward offsetting the high annual fee. After enrollment, you get up to $200 in statement credits toward airline incidental fees like checked bags and in-flight purchases, up to $100 each year in credit toward Saks Fifth Avenue purchases, and up to $200 in annual Uber credits (including Uber Eats). The Platinum Card® from American Express comes with a range of valuable benefits that require activation, including up to $300 annually in Equinox credits; $199 a year in credits for CLEAR® Plus membership; up to $200 a year in credits toward eligible prepaid hotel bookings; up to $240 in annual credits toward eligible digital subscriptions; a monthly credit for Walmart+ membership; and up to $300 back for purchasing a SoulCycle At-Home Bike through Equinox+. With the Uber credit, you get up to $15 each month, and a $20 bonus in December for a total of $35 that month. As of November 2024, an Amex credit card must be selected as the payment method for your Uber or Uber Eats transaction in order to redeem the Amex Uber Cash benefit. What the experts love:Lots of luxury benefits, including airport lounge access and statement credits with Uber and Saks What the experts don't love:This card's $695 annual fee (rates and fees), and minimal bonus categories Read more:The Platinum Card® from American Express review Travel credit cards reward their cardholders with bonus points on travel-related expenses, and offer travel-related insurance benefits and purchase protections. There's a card designed for people seeking free flights, hoping for free hotel stays, or just doing whatever it takes to realize their dreams of relaxing in an overwater bungalow. There are even no-annual-fee travel credit cards that won't cost you anything to maintain. Read Business Insider's guide topoints and miles valuationsto find out what your airline miles, hotel points, and credit card rewards are worth. Here's ourmethodology for assigning a cash value to your points and miles. While it takes more effort to redeem points or miles compared to cash back, the upside is that you can get much more value for your points compared to simply cashing in your rewards for a statement credit or check at a rate of 1 cent per point. In fact, it's possible to receive double, triple, or even more than that amount when you're strategic about how you redeem your rewards, particularly if you book expensive luxury hotels or first-class flights. In this guide, we've focused mostly on the best travel credit cards that earn transferable points. Transferable points include popular currencies such as: You can transfer these points to both airline and hotel partner loyalty programs. You can even redeem your points to offset the cash price of your travel at a flat rate. Credit card rewards can be exhilarating to earn and redeem, but they're never worth incurring debt. The first rule of utilizing credit cards is to never carry a balance that incurs interest, because high fees will quickly eliminate any net gains from earning travel rewards. If you do have to carry a balance, consider getting one of thebest balance transfer credit cardswith 0% intro APR, so you can pay down what you owe without paying a lot of interest. Many of the best credit cards offer rotating benefits or periodic credits, such as The Platinum Card® from American Express's semi-annual Saks credit or the Chase Sapphire Reserve® annual travel credit. Travel credit cards offer various benefits including earning points or miles on travel and everyday purchases, access to travel perks such as lounge access and travel insurance, and often come with sign-up bonuses that can be redeemed for free flights or hotel stays. When choosing the best travel credit card, consider your travel habits, preferred airlines or hotel chains, annual fee tolerance, and the rewards and benefits the card offers. Compare different cards to find one that aligns with your specific needs and travel goals. Some potential downsides include annual fees, higher interest rates if you carry a balance, and rewards programs that might be restrictive if you don't travel frequently. It's important to weigh these factors against the benefits to determine if a travel credit card is right for you. Yes, most travel credit cards allow you to earn points or miles on everyday purchases, which can help you accumulate rewards faster. However, the earning rate may vary depending on the spending category. Look for a rewards program that offers a high earning rate on travel-related purchases, flexible redemption options, valuable travel perks, and a generous sign-up bonus. Additionally, consider if the card offers rewards that align with your travel preferences and spending habits. If you want a single credit card that does it all and don't mind paying a generous annual fee, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® is a great choice. It comes with the best travel insurance available on the market, as well as a $300 travel credit each year that can be used on most types of travel. We'd recommend opening a travel card that earns Amex or Chase points, because these are among the easiest rewards to redeem and you have various travel partners to utilize. But if you've investigated your options and are confident that you can get value out of their rewards,credit cards that earn Capital One milesorCiti ThankYou pointscan make sense as well. There are two main types of travel credit cards: Cards that earn transferable points, and airline/hotel co-branded credit cards. Transferable points currencies include Amex Membership Rewards points, Capital One miles, and Chase Ultimate Rewards points.Airline credit cardsandhotel credit cardsearn points or miles within a respective hotel or airline program. You don't have the option to redeem your rewards with a wide variety of travel partners — or if you do, the transfer ratio usually isn't great. Travel credit cards with annual fees are worth it if you're able to get significant value out of their benefits and rewards. Before youapply for a card, make sure you'll actually use all the features that contribute to the card's annual fee. For example, if a card offers an annual statement credit of up to $200 toward travel but you can't use it, you're probably not getting what you pay for. Travel credit cards work by earning you points (or miles) on every purchase you make, with the goal of helping you earn enoughrewards to book free travel. The best travel cards earn points that you can transfer to various airline and hotel partners — like Amex, Chase, or Citi points. A great way to work toward getting a free flight is by applying for a travel credit card and earning its welcome bonus offer. Domestic award flights in economy class typically require about 25,000 points, so depending on the welcome bonus offer, you could have enough rewards for a flight right out of the gate.

It's also the better option if you want to open a savings account but not a checking account, as Chime requires you to have a checking account to qualify for savings. Capital One also offers a high-yield savings account with a significantly better rate than what Chime pays. This account gives it a major edge over Chime.

Your money is actually being held in bank accounts offered by those two banks, which means the money in your checking account and savings account are FDIC-insured for up to $250,000. To review Chime, we used thePersonal Finance Insider bank account methodology. Each account receives a rating between one and five stars. We look at ethics, security, miscellaneous features, customer service, and the mobile app when rating each bank account. Other factors considered depend on which type of account we're reviewing. For example, we evaluate interest rates for savings accounts and overdraft fees for checking accounts. We use a weighted average to get our star rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience. Yes, Chime has legit checking and savings accounts. Its partner banks are Stride Bank, N.A. and The Bancorp Bank, which provide FDIC insurance on up to $250,000 in your Chime accounts. Some of Chime's main downsides are that it doesn't have joint accounts, and it pays a lower savings rate than many other onlinehigh-yield savings accounts.

Chime has a free overdraft protection program called SpotMe®. This program allows you to overdraw by up to $20, and your limit may go up to $200, depending on your Chime account history.

        "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com/",
        "content": "DeepSeek, a Chinese company with AI models that compete with OpenAI's at a fraction of the cost, is generating almost as many takes astokens. Across Silicon Valley, executives, investors, and employees debated the implications of such efficient models. Some called into question the trillions of dollars being spent onAIinfrastructure since DeepSeek says its models were trained for a relative pittance. \"This is insane!!!!\"Aravind Srinivas, CEO of startup Perplexity AI, wrote in response to a post on X noting that DeepSeek models are cheaper and better than some of OpenAI's latest offerings. The takes on DeepSeek's implications are coming fast and hot. Here are eight of the most common. \"Jevons paradox strikes again!\" Microsoft CEOSatya Nadellaposted on X Monday morning. \"As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of.\" The idea that as tech improves, whether smarter, cheaper, or both, it will only bring in exponentially more demand is based on a 19th-century economic principle. In this case, the barrier to entry for companies looking to dip their toe into AI has been high. Cheaper tools could encourage more experimentation and further the technology faster. \"Similar to Llama, it lowers the barriers to adoption, enabling more businesses to accelerate AI use cases and move them into production.\" Umesh Padval, managing director at Thomvest Ventures told Business Insider. That said, even if AI grows faster than ever, that doesn't necessarily mean the trillions of investments that have flooded the space will pay off. \"DeepSeek seems to have broken the assumption that you need a lot of capital to train cutting-edge models,\" Debarghya Das, an investor at Menlo Ventures told BI. The price of DeepSeek's open-source model is competitive — 20 to 40 timescheaper to usethan comparable models from OpenAI, according to Bernstein analysts. The exact cost of building DeepSeek models is hotly debated. The research paper from DeepSeek explaining its V3 model lists a training cost of $5.6 million — a harrowingly low number for other providers of foundation models. However, the same paper says that the \"aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.\" So the $5 million figure is only part of the equation. The tech ecosystem is also reacting strongly to the implication that DeepSeek'sstate-of-the-art model architecturewill be cheaper to run. \"This breakthrough slashes computational demands, enabling lower fees — and putting pressure on industry titans like Microsoft and Google to justify their premium pricing,\" Kenneth Lamont, principal at Morningstar, wrote in a note on Monday. He went on to remind investors that with early-stage technology, assuming the winners are set is folly. \"Mega-trends rarely unfold as expected, and today's dominant players might not be tomorrow's winners,\" Lamont wrote. Dmitry Shevelenko, the chief business officer at Perplexity, a big consumer of compute and existing models, concurred that Big Tech players would need to rethink their numbers. \"It certainly challenges the margin structure that maybe they were selling to investors,\" Shevelenko told BI. \"But in terms of accelerating the development of these technologies, this is a good thing.\" Perplexity has added DeepSeek's models to its platform. On Monday, several platforms that provide AI models for businesses—Groqand Liquid.AI to name two — added DeepSeek's models to their offerings. On Amazon's internal Slack, one person posted a meme suggesting that developers might drop Anthropic's Claude AI model in favor of DeepSeek's offerings. The post included an image of the Claude model crossed out. \"Friendship ended with Claude. Now DeepSeek is my best friend.\" the person wrote, according to a screenshot of the post seen by BI, which got more than 60 emoji reactions from colleagues. Amazon has invested billions of dollars in Anthropic. The cloud giant also provides access to Claude models via its Amazon Web Service platform. And some AWS customers are asking for DeepSeek,BI has exclusively reported. \"We are always listening to customers to bring the latest emerging and popular models to AWS,\" an Amazon spokesperson said, while noting that customers can access some DeepSeek-related products on AWS right now through tools such asBedrock. \"We expect to see many more models like this — both large and small, proprietary and open-source — excel at different tasks,\" the Amazon spokesperson added. \"This is why the majority of Amazon Bedrock customers use multiple models to meet their unique needs and why we remain focused on providing our customers with choice — so they can easily experiment and integrate the best models for their specific needs into their applications.\" Switching costs for companies creating their own products on top of foundation models are relatively low, which is generating a lot of questions as to whether DeepSeek will overtake other models from Meta, Anthropic, or OpenAI in popularity with enterprises. (It's already number one in Apple's app store.) DeepSeek, however, is owned by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer and the samesecurity concerns haunting TikTokmay eventually apply to DeepSeek. \"While open-source models like DeepSeek present exciting opportunities, enterprises—especially in regulated industries—may hesitate to adopt Chinese-origin models due to concerns about training data transparency, privacy, and security,\" Padval said. Security concerns aside, the software companies that sell APIs to businesses have been adding DeepSeek throughout Monday. Infrastructure-as-a-service companies, such as Oracle, Digital Ocean, and Microsoft could be in a precarious position should more efficient AI models rule in the future. \"The sheer efficiency of DeepSeek's pre and post training framework (if true) raises the question as to whether or not global hyperscalers and governments, that have and intend to continue to invest significant capex dollars into AI infrastructure, may pause to consider the innovative methodologies that have come to light with DeepSeek's research,\" wrote Stifel analysts. If the same quantity of work requires less compute, those selling only compute could suffer, Barclays analysts wrote. \"With the increased uncertainty, we could see share price pressure amongst all three,\" according to the analysts. Microsoft and Digital Ocean declined to comment. Oracle did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. For months, AI luminaries, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have been predicting a big shift in AI from a focus on training to a focus oninference. Training is the process by which models are created while inference is the type of computing that runs AI models and related tools such as ChatGPT. The shift in computing's total share to inference has been underway for a while, but now, change is coming from two places. First, more AI users means more inference demand. The second is that part of DeepSeek's secret sauce is how improvement takes place in the inference stage. Nvidia took a positive spin, via a spokesperson. \"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told BI. \"Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\" The most under-hyped part of DeepSeek's innovations is how easy it will now be to take any AI model and turn it into a more powerful \"reasoning\" model, according to Jack Clark, an Anthropic cofounder, and a former OpenAI employee,wrote about DeepSeekin his newsletter Import AI on Monday. Clark also explained that some AI companies, such as OpenAI, have been hiding all the reasoning steps that their latest AI models take. DeepSeek's models show all these intermediate \"chains of thought\" for anyone to see and use. This radically changes how AI models are controlled, Clark wrote. \"Some providers like OpenAI had previously chosen to obscure the chains of thought of their models, making this harder,\" Clark explained. \"There's now an open-weight model floating around the internet which you can use to bootstrap any other sufficiently powerful base model into being an AI reasoner. AI capabilities worldwide just took a one-way ratchet forward.\" DeepSeek improved by using novel programming methods, which Samir Kumar, co-founder and general partner at VC firm Touring Capital, saw as a reminder that humans are still coding the most exciting innovations in AI. He told BI that DeepSeek is \"a good reminder of the talent and skillset of hardcore human low-level programmers.\" Got a tip or an insight to share?Contact BI's senior reporter Emma Cosgrove atecosgrove@businessinsider.comor use the secure messaging app Signal: 443-333-9088.

It's geared toward those who are taking steps to improve their financial situation, and offers features that can help you increase your credit score and reduce the amount of interest you pay. One benefit designed to help you build your credit is an automatic, one-time review for a higher credit limit if you've paid on time and spent at least $500 in your first six months of opening the Chase Slate Edge℠. A higher limit could have a positive effect on your credit utilization ratio and potentiallyimprove your credit score. In addition, on each account anniversary, you'll be considered for a 2% APR reduction, as long as you've paid your card on time and spent at least $1,000 on purchases in the previous anniversary year. The reduction is capped, though — it will only be reduced until your APR reaches the Prime Rate plus 9.74% (Prime Rate is 7.50% as of 12/19/2024). Learn more in ourChase Slate Edge card review. With so many cards to choose from, your options may seem overwhelming. Here are some of the features to consider when evaluating no-interest credit cards to ensure you maximize the benefits of 0% APR. The goal of a 0% APR credit card is to help you pay down a balance without incurring interest. If you are using the card to buy something expensive, you'll want one that offers zero interest on new purchases. If you already have outstanding debt, you want a credit card that offers zero interest on balance transfers. If you plan to incur a mix of both types of debt, focus on cards that don't charge interest on both purchases and balance transfers. Not all 0% intro APR balance transfer credit cards are created equal. Most cards charge anywhere from 3% to 5% of the transaction amount, and some offer a slightly lower transaction fee during the initial period after you open the card. If you plan to transfer a large debt from an existing card to a zero-interest card, you may save a few hundred dollars by choosing a product that offers lower balance transfer fees. Your period of no interest won't last forever, and fees can quickly skyrocket if you miscalculate or misunderstand when your grace period ends. A best practice for avoiding unnecessary fees is to note your 0% intro APR expiration date on your calendar when you first receive the card and set periodic reminders to check your outstanding balance and expiration date.You can always find your 0% APR rate and expiration date on your monthly statements, or call your credit card issuer for more details. Plenty of the best zero-interest credit cards don't charge annual fees, so there's no need to choose a 0% intro APR card with an annual fee unless there are additional benefits to the card that make the cost worth your while. A good 0% intro APR credit card should come with additional benefits and rewards in addition to the zero-interest period. Common perks include entertainment discounts and early access, travel advantages and protection, and credit score monitoring. Many credit cards offer the ability to check your FICO credit score for free. Most issuers that offer this feature provide monthly updates, and you can check your scores online or via your credit card app. Many issuers offer text and email alerts if they detect suspicious activity. In addition to preventing unauthorized transactions where possible, your credit card issuer may also offer a liability guarantee for fraudulent charges. Many credit cards now integrate with mobile payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay, making it easy to pay for your purchases using your smartphone or other devices. You may even be able to use your card immediately after approval if the issuer offers instant virtual credit card numbers. This is especially valuable if you apply for your zero-interest credit card right before you make a large purchase. A 0% APR credit card offers an introductory period during which no interest is charged on purchases and/or balance transfers. This period typically ranges from 12 to 18 months, providing an opportunity for interest-free financing. Yes, you need to pay off your 0% interest credit card eventually, because the intro offer won't last forever. During the introductory period, you typically need to make the minimum payment on the card (if not more) in order to avoid losing your intro 0% APR. You should have a plan to pay off your entire balance before the intro period ends to avoid paying interest on your remaining balance. You can get a 0% interest credit card by applying online. You can also check with your bank in person to see if it offers any 0% intro APR cards that appeal to you. Keep in mind most cards with intro APR offers require you to have at least agood credit score, which means aFICO scoreof 670 or higher. Using a zero interest credit card won't hurt your credit. In fact, if the intro APR offer allows you pay down your debt before the intro period ends, it could actually help your credit score by reducing your amount owed. Make sure to only spend what you can afford to pay off to avoid incurring more debt and high interest fees. You can save money by making large purchases and paying them off over time without incurring interest charges. Additionally, you can transfer existing high-interest debt to the 0% APR card to reduce interest payments and pay down debt faster. Once the introductory 0% APR period ends, the card's standard APR will apply to any remaining balance. It's important to understand the post-introductory APR rate and make a plan to pay off your balance before the 0% period expires. Yes, some 0% APR credit cards may have fees, such as balance transfer fees, annual fees, or late payment fees. It's important to review the card's terms and conditions to understand any potential costs. While having a good to excellent credit score increases your chances of qualifying for a 0% APR credit card, some cards may be available to those with fair credit. It's advisable to check the eligibility requirements of each card before applying. Business Insider chose the best credit cards with 0% introductory APR offers by looking through all the credit cards that offered zero-interest periods. We then evaluated the terms and length of each introductory offer, with cards that offer longer introductory periods ranking more highly than others. We also considered rewards, like cash back or travel points, card benefits, and factors like annual fees and foreign transaction fees.

The information for the following product(s) has been collected independently by Business Insider: Carrington Mortgage Services Refinance. The details for these products have not been reviewed or provided by the issuer.  You might have different priorities when choosing a refinance lender than when you first got your mortgage. For example, a fast closing probably won't matter to you as much as getting the lowest rate possible. As you compare mortgage refinance lenders, be sure to consider your overall costs, including closing costs, in addition to your rate. When picking the best mortgage lenders for refinancing, Business Insider looked for lenders that have low average rates and fees, thrive in customer satisfaction, and have features that help them stand out — such as offering loans with low minimum credit scores or digital closing options. These are the best mortgage refinance lenders as chosen by Business Insider editors in 2024. Offers affordable mortgage programs, including lender credits up to $7,500 and a 1% down conventional loan. 620 Conventional, cash-out, FHA, VA refinancing Rocket Mortgage, formerly known as Quicken Loans, is a strong lender in general and our \"best overall\" pick for the best mortgage refinance lenders. It's a great option if you're comfortable applying online and have a good credit score. Rocket Mortgage is our top choice thanks to its easy-to-use online application and its strong track record in providing great customer service. It ranked high in customer satisfaction inJ.D. Power's 2024 Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Studyand has many positive online customer reviews. Refinancers will like the lender's \"YOURgage\" loans, which let you choose any term length between eight and 29 years. What to look out for:Its loan options are relatively limited, and it doesn't have any in-person branches. Rocket's rates and fees are around average compared to other lenders, according toHome Mortgage Disclosure Act data. Rocket Mortgage Review Offers a Low Cost Mortgage option where you pay only $395 in closing costs (in exchange for a higher rate) N/A 3% Conforming, Smart Rate Adjustable Mortgage, jumbo, bridge loan, HELOC, home equity loan Third Federal Savings and Loan is a really unique mortgage lender that offers an impressive number of perks compared to other lenders we've reviewed. Third Federal Savings and Loan is an extremely affordable mortgage lender if you're looking for a low rate or low fees. Based on our review of HMDA data, Third Federal's average mortgage rates are lower than many other lenders we've reviewed. This lender also offers a product called a Low Cost Mortgage, which comes with only $395 in closing costs. If you don't want to pay a lot of cash out of pocket to refinance, this could be a good option for you. However, you'll have a slightly higher rate to compensate for the costs the lender covers. What to look out for:Third Federal mortgages are only available in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, and Washington, D.C. Third Federal Mortgage Review 650 3% Conforming, jumbo, FHA, VA, HELOC A lot of lenders offer VA loans, including many of the lenders on this list. But for refinancing, we like PenFed, which has low average fees, according to HMDA data. Plus, if you're getting a VAstreamline refinance(also known as an interest rate reduction refinance loan), PenFed will cover your closing costs (including the VA funding fee).

Carrington offers several mortgages that have flexible credit guidelines, including its Carrington Flexible Advantage Refinance mortgage, which allows credit scores as low as 550 and recent negative credit events like bankruptcy. What to look out for:Carrington doesn't lend in Massachusetts or North Dakota. According to HMDA data, this lender's rates and fees are higher than average. Carrington has anNR, or \"no rating\" from the BBBbecause the lender is responding to previously closed complaints. Additionally, in November 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Carrington to pay $5.25 million in fines for supposedly violating borrowers'CARES Act rights. The CFPB claims that the lender misled borrowers seeking CARES Act forbearance and denied them key protections provided by the pandemic-era law. Carrington Mortgage Services Review The lenders on this list are affordable and have offerings that should meet most borrowers' needs, but ultimately it comes down to what rate you're offered and whether a given lender suits your needs. There are a few differentreasons to refinanceyour mortgage. Think about what you want to achieve with your refinance, and look for lenders that can meet those needs. Are you looking to do acash-out refinance? Do you want to change the type of mortgage you have? Is getting the lowest rate possible more important than having a good customer service experience? Make sure the lenders you're considering offer the type of refinance and level of service you want. Mortgage ratescan vary a lot between lenders, and your own financial situation will have a big impact on the range of rates available to you. You might be able to get a low rate with a specific lender, while another borrower can get a better rate elsewhere. The best way to know what rate you'll get with a lender is to apply for a mortgage. Experts typically recommend applying with at least three different lenders to be able to compare rates accurately. Though borrowers often start the refinancing process with the goal of getting the lowest rate possible, it's important to consider your overall costs. Some lenders offer low rates but charge a lot in fees or add discount points to lower the rate (which you'll pay for at closing). Refinancing can enable you to tap into your home's equity, lower your rate, get rid of mortgage insurance, extend or shorten your term, or change the type of mortgage you have. You'll need to meet the lender's credit requirements to qualify for a mortgage refinance, and having a greatcredit scorecan help you snag a better rate. The exception to this is if you're getting a streamline refinance, which is available ongovernment-backed mortgages. Some streamline transactions don't require the borrower to show a credit score. You'll need to do some math to figure out if it makes sense financially to refinance. Because refinancing isn't free, you'll want to weigh the costs against the benefits. For example, if you're refinancing to lower yourmortgage payment, calculate how long it will take you to recoup your closing costs. If you spent $2,000 to refinance and lowered your monthly payment by $200, it would take 10 months of payments to break even. An online refinance calculator can help you figure out if refinancing is worth it. You don't have to get a mortgage with your current lender or bank, but you might find that it can offer you certain benefits or discounts as a returning customer. Big banks are well-established financial institutions that offer many other services besides mortgage lending. Although they sometimes have a reputation for not offering as much personalized support as smaller lenders, many of the big bank lenders we've reviewed rank high in customer satisfaction. Nonbank mortgage lenders that operate mostly online are a popular choice with tech-savvy borrowers. These lenders may offer lower rates since they don't have the same operational costs as lenders with physical footprints, but this isn't always the case. Smaller, local lenders are often able to offer better customer service than lenders that are working with a large number of borrowers. But you should compare their rates with some larger lenders to make sure they're competitive. Amortgage brokerwill do all the legwork of getting quotes from different mortgage lenders for you. If you want to be able to easily compare many different loan options, you might prefer working with a broker. Our top pick for refinancing is Rocket Mortgage, and we think it's a good choice if customer service and customizable terms are important to you. But ultimately the best company for refinancing depends on your needs and goals. You might prefer refinancing with your current lender if you like the customer service it offers and you value convenience. But shopping around and comparing rates for the type of loan you want (like a30-year mortgage refinance) gives you a chance to see what types of deals are available to you. There's no single lender that offers the best mortgage rates, since rates change every day and your rate will be based on your individual financial profile. Keep an eye on currentmortgage refinance ratesto see where rates are at right now, and compare that to the rates you're offered as you shop around for a lender. You might like an online lender if you prefer a quick application process that you can complete from the comfort of your home. But working with a bank that has physical branches can have benefits too, particularly if you want to sit down face-to-face to discuss your options. Lenders typically look for at least a 620 credit score to refinance into a conventional loan. You also may need a certain amount of equity in your home — possibly as little as 5%, or as much as 20%. Refinancing may temporarily lower your credit score when you first apply since the lender will do a hard check of your credit. But it should recover quickly. To help you learn more about refinancing and lenders, four experts weighed in: We consulted mortgage and financial experts to inform these picks and provide their insights about mortgage refinance lenders. Here's what they had to say about mortgage refinancing. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) How can someone know whether it's a good time to refinance? Julie Aragon, Aragon Lending Team: \"The monthly savings and the cost for the refinance. When you have those two things, you can determine the break-even point. Also, how long they intend to stay in the house. If they know they're going to sell next year, it probably doesn't make sense to refinance.\" Lauryn Williams, CFP: \"A lot of times people don't realize refinancing comes with some additional costs. There's those closing costs, title costs, et cetera, that are tied into the overall fees. Simply getting a lower interest rate doesn't mean that you're saving money, is the biggest factor that a lot of people are not aware of.\" What factors should someone take into consideration when choosing a mortgage refinance lender? Anthony Park, author: \"I feel like with a refinance, you're going based on numbers a lot more than on your original mortgage. Probably because the mortgage feels like more of a weighty transaction, whereas with refinancing, you're kind of an old hand at it at this point. I think the numbers matter a lot more for a refinance.\" Molly Grace, Business Insider \"You don't have the same time crunch during a refinance that you do when you're purchasing, so take your time to really evaluate the offers you're shown and don't rush into anything. Lenders are pros at making refinancing sound really attractive — even if it's not necessarily the best long-term financial move for you. Remember that their job is to sell you something, and your job is to make sure you're making the best decisions for your finances.\" When is it a good idea to get a cash-out refinance? Julie Aragon, Aragon Lending Team: \"Investing the money into the home I think is always a good idea, as long as the math makes sense. Also paying off high-interest credit card debt. We have some clients, when we look at all of their debts, some are at 19% or 20%. By paying off all this crap, they'll save $1,500 or $2,000 a month.\" Lauryn Williams, CFP: \"I think it's a tough situation, because sometimes with cash-out refi is, you're thinking of things like credit card debt. This is the biggest one I hear from clients: I can get rid of this 23% interest that I have on my credit card debt, and I can put it in my 2% mortgage. Well, you just took something that was not tied to any collateral. They can't take your home away if you don't pay your credit card debt. So something that previously couldn't result in my home being in a way now can add to the stress of my home being taken away should I not be able to pay my mortgage.\" Methodology: How Did We Choose the Best Mortgage Refinance Lenders?

You can find our guide on thebest CFAR travel insurance companieshere. Losing your belongings is more than an inconvenience; it's losing a piece of your world. Insurance that covers personal belongings and baggage loss ensures that you're compensated for your loss, helping you to rebound and continue your adventure. In times of trouble, having a lifeline can make all the difference. Look for insurance that offers 24/7 support and assistance services, giving you peace of mind that help is just a phone call away. Also, check websites that field customer reviews like Trustpilot, the Better Business Bureau, andInsureMyTrip, to see how well a company responds to customer requests. A provider's reputation is not just about being well-known; it's about reliability, customer satisfaction, and the ability to deliver on promises. Researching and choosing a reputable provider is a cornerstone in ensuring your safety and satisfaction. The devil is in the details, and understanding the fine print ofwhat your travel insurance policy coversis crucial. Be aware of coverage limits, exclusions, and the process for filing a claim to avoid any unpleasant surprises. For example, to get coverage for a canceled trip due to work, many travel insurance companies require that you've been with that company for at least a year. In the age of information, customer reviews and feedback are goldmines of insight. Learn from the experiences of others to gauge the reliability and customer service of the insurance provider you're considering. While the ratings are important, you should also look at whether or not a company responds to customer complaints. Familiarize yourself with every aspect of your policy — what it covers, what it doesn't, how to file a claim, and who to contact in an emergency. Being informed means being prepared. At the very least, you should have the terms readily available while you're on your trip. If you face an issue during your travels, knowing the immediate steps to take can make all the difference. Your insurance company may even have a 24/7 assistance hotline that can walk you through an emergency during your trip, even issues that don't involve claims. When a problem arises. you'll want to document as much as possible, in case you need proof when filing a claim. Ask for receipts and invoices when possible. There isn't a one-size-fits-all policy that works perfectly for every traveler. Young, healthy solo travelers can opt for much cheaper plans that offer bare-bones coverage, while families juggling complex itineraries will do best by investing in a robust policy that can help defray any costs associated with lost baggage, delayed transportation or other trip-impeding obstacles. That being said, you can't go wrong with a travel insurance provider that boasts a reputable history and offers a wide range of customizable plans. In some cases, you may be comparing plans that are only a few dollars' apart from each other. In such situations, you should generally opt for the insurance company that offers the strongest customer service. It's also worth considering whether or not the travel insurance provider has been reviewed by other travelers with similar itineraries to your own. An insurance aggregator like InsureMyTrip orSquaremouthis one of the best tools for searching travel insurance policies. Once you input the specifics of your travel itinerary, you'll be able to see hundreds of search results to compare the ones that catch your eye. If the options are too overwhelming, use the filters to the left of your search page to eliminate as many irrelevant plans as possible. To come up with our list of the best travel insurance companies, Business Insider evaluated each insurer based on the following factors: Policy Types Travel insurance is essential, but often underused partly because people aren't getting what they want.Business Insider's 2023 travel studyshowed 10.65% of travelers surveyed bought cancel for any reason insurance. Cost may be a factor, but in many cases, the coverage is more affordable than you might think. Regardless, companies must offer a diverse range of coverage options. We award five stars to companies offering all standard coverages and additional options like pet and sports equipment protection. Our 2023 travel study indicated the majority of purchases were made through the travel provider (ex: flight protection insurance when you're purchasing your airline tickets). While these may be sufficient for some customers, we look for companies offering a more comprehensive range of services. Cost According to the U.S. Travel Insurance Association, the average cost of travel insurance will be between 4% and 8% of total travel expenses. Anything beyond that price point should include additional benefits beyond the standard inclusions, such as CFAR protection or upgraded medical coverage. Anything below that 4% threshold may leave you lacking important or sufficient coverage in an emergency. Convenience and Flexibility Whether you're an infrequent traveler or a suitcase warrior, a good travel insurance company should have you covered. In many cases, you might not even have to talk to a person in order to purchase your policy. Many people think of travel insurance in context with specific trips, but most of these top contenders sell both single-trip and multi-trip policies, also known as annual travel insurance. Some companies also offer plans specifically designed for cruisers, students abroad, and business travelers. (Read our guide to thebest cruise travel insurance companiesfor more details.) Finally, all of these providers offer multiple options for getting the specific areas and amounts of coverage that you want. Claims Handling Most travelers never have a large claim. Premiums are low, and it provides peace of mind for the just in case situations. So they leave reviews based on their reduced stress levels. But what happens if you lose your luggage or have to stay a few extra days due to an unexpected accident? Will your insurance carrier cover your claim without all the hassle? We check real customer reviews to sort this out for you. Ease of Use and Support When purchasing, during your trip, and throughout the claims process, you may need extra support. Does the company have a 24/7 help line? Does it have an online or mobile system allowing you to self-manage? Essentially, what are the options when you need help? We look at the big picture to evaluate the average customer experience with each company. You can read more abouthow Business Insider rates travel insurancefor even more details. And see our guide to thebest travel insurance in Californiaif you're traveling to that state, specifically. Business Insider's overall best travel insurance provider is Nationwide for its breadth of coverage options. AIG Travel Guard, AXA, C&F Travel Insured, Tin Leg, WorldTrips, and Trawick also made the cut. While coverage varies by policy, common exclusions often include pre-existing medical conditions (unless you have purchased a waiver), accidents caused by high-risk activities if not specifically covered (e.g., skydiving, scuba diving), travel for medical procedures, and events known before purchasing the policy (e.g., traveling during a pandemic). Always read your policy carefully to understand the exclusions. You can find the right travel insurance by considering the benefits most important to you, whether you want to prioritize medical coverage or trip cancellation.

Debt consolidation is when you take out one loan and use it to pay off other debts that you have, leaving you with one monthly payment and interest rate. This can help you manage your debt more efficiently, and, in some cases, reduce the total amount of interest you'll pay if the new loan's APR is lower. Generally, you'll need a personal loan for debt consolidation, which means replacing multiple loans with a single loan instead. Business Insider's personal finance experts chose thebest personal loansfor consolidating debt, and we highlight their features below. 0.50% discount on regular rates with AutoPay 6.99% to 25.49% (with AutoPay discount, rates vary by loan purpose) $5,000 to $100,000 660 LightStream offers some of the lowest rates on personal loans out there, provided you have a great credit score.

Just be prepared to pay a high APR if you do have a low score. Lightstream is a highly regarded lender for many loan types, and has been a top pick across Business Insider's coverage of thebest personal loansandbest auto loans. However, this lender only works with borrowers with good or better credit, with a minimum credit score requirement of 660. LightStream offers consistentlylow personal loan interest rates, though its minimum interest rate for debt consolidation is higher than its typical personal loan's interest rates. However, this lender does not have any prepayment or origination fees. Same-day funding is available with LightStream. Watch out for:Maximum loan amount limits. Only borrowers with excellent credit can borrow the $100,000 maximum, and anyone without excellent credit may not qualify for the full amount. LightStream defines excellent credit as an account with five or more years of credit history, stable and sufficient income for debts, and a variety of credit history with little or no credit card debt. If you're looking for a debt consolidation loan, chances are you have a significant amount of debt, and may not fit these qualifications. Additionally, LightStream doesn't have a way to pre-qualify online. You'll have to apply for the loan to find out exactly what your rates and terms could look like, which could make comparison shopping difficult.

An Avant personal loan is the best bet for borrowers with poor credit, requiring a minimum credit score of 600. Compared with other personal loan lenders offering debt consolidation loans for bad credit borrowers, Avant's terms are the most generous. While there is an administration fee, it could be lower than competitors' fees with a cap up to 4.75% in administration fees with an undisclosed late fee and returned payment fee. Avant also has the advantage of offeringfast personal loan funding. Watch out for:High rates with a low credit score.

Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourAvant Personal Loan review. In the fair credit range, it can be tough to qualify for a personal loan with reasonable interest rates — many lenders have a minimum of 660 or 680. However, a Happy Money Payoff Loan™ could be a good option for people with credit scores as low as 640. Interest rates are comparable to those offered by LightStream and SoFi, but this lender has less stringent requirements. Compared with competitorsProsperandBest Egg, which both have the same 640 minimum credit score requirement, Payoff's interest rates are capped lower, and could have lower origination fees. Watch out for:Origination fees. Payoff offers loans with a 0% to 5% origination fee. Competing lenders Prosper and Best Egg charge 1.00% to 9.99% and 0.99% and 9.99% origination fees, respectively. The better deal will depend on your credit score, income, and repayment term. Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourHappy Money Personal Loan review. Flexibility makes Wells Fargo personal loan a top contender for best personal loans for debt consolidation. Wells Fargo separates debt consolidation loans from personal loans, but the interest rates are the same. Benefits include competitive interest rates and an autopay discount of 0.25% if payments are made from a Wells Fargo account.

The BBB measures businesses based on factors like their responsiveness to customer complaints, honesty in advertising, and transparency about business practices. We've compared each institution's Better Business Bureau score to give you another piece of information to choose your lender. Whether you're considering a$5,000 loanor a$10,000 loan, a trustworthy lender can improve your loan experience. Here is each company's score: With the exception of Wells Fargo, our top picks are rated A or higher by the BBB. Keep in mind that a high BBB score does not guarantee a positive relationship with a lender, and that you should continue to do research and talk to others who have used the company to get the most complete information possible. Wells Fargo is currently rated an F by the BBB due to government actions against the business and a failure to respond to 14 complaints. Most recently, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in December 2022 ordered Wells Fargo to return $2 billion to customers and pay a $1.7 billion penalty for legal violations involving auto loans, mortgages, and deposit accounts. The bank illegally charged fees and interest penalties on auto and mortgage loans. Additionally, it misapplied payments to those loans for many customers. If you're uncomfortable with this history, you may want to use one of the other personal loan lenders on our list. The main benefits of consolidating debt are streamlining your debts into a single account with one monthly payment and reducing the total amount of interest you'll owe. When shopping for a debt consolidation loan, look for an APR that is lower than the average you're paying on the debt you want to consolidate. If you can't qualify for a lower rate, a debt consolidation loan might not be a good choice for you. Also consider the loan amounts, associated fees and penalties, as well as a lender's credit score minimum and other eligibility requirements when choosing a debt consolidation loan. Qualifying for a debt consolidation loan is the same as it is for most other kinds of personal loans. Generally, lenders require a credit score in the mid-600s, although some will accept borrowers with lower scores. Remember, though, that with a lower credit score, you'll pay a higher interest rate. In addition to checking your credit score, debt consolidation companies will also need proof of your employment and ability to repay in order to determine eligibility. They will also check yourdebt-to-income ratioto make sure you haven't borrowed more than you can feasibly pay back. Most lenders will allow you to prequalify for a loan, which allows you to compare interest rates and terms without affecting your credit score. After you've gotten prequalified with several lenders, compare their offers and choose the one that best suits your needs. To complete thefull loan application processyou'll need a significant amount of documentation, including things like: Get these basics in order before applying for the loan, in order to speed up the process. You can apply for most loans by filling out a form online. If you are approved, the lender will send you the final loan documents to sign off on. These include all the details such as the interest rate, the amount of time you have to pay it off, the amount you're borrowing, the monthly payments, and any fees. Make sure you fully understand all of it before signing for the loan. If you're looking for a debt consolidation loan because your credit cards carry high APRs, it's worth your time to consider some alternatives. One often underutilized strategy is to simply ask your credit card company for a lower rate. There's no guarantee that they'll agree. However, they may well do so, especially if you've been diligent about payments. You can also ask about upgrading your credit card, which may come with a lower APR and other perks. You may also be able to get a lower rate by transferring your balances to a different credit card. Cards designed for this purposeoften come with an introductory 0% APRperiod that can last anywhere from 12-18 months. Remember that you'll need to pay off your balance before the intro period ends to avoid being hit with high interest rates. Tackling your debt head-on using strategies such as theavalanche and snowball methodsis another alternative. Check forlow interest personal loan offerswithout impacting your credit score. Compare Personal Loan Rates Personal loans are the most common type of loan used for debt consolidation. Other options for consolidating debt include ahome equity loan, ahome equity line of credit(HELOC), and abalance transfer credit card. A debt consolidation loan could be a good idea. When you take out a debt consolidation loan, the funds are used to pay down the debts you have with multiple lenders, leaving you with a single monthly payment to make. Keep in mind that it does not erase your debt, and you might end up paying more over the long term even if you end up paying less each month on the consolidation loan. Debt consolidation loans don't necessarily hurt your credit score. In fact, your credit will often be boosted in the long run if you consolidate your debt because it can reduce the amount you owe and lower monthly minimum payments, which all affect your credit score. With a debt consolidation loan, you can benefit from a lower interest rate. Most personal loans allow a variety of uses. While most include credit card consolidation or debt consolidation, not all do. Read the fine print of any personal loan you're applying for, and make sure that debt consolidation is an acceptable use of the proceeds. All of the loans we considered had an option to use the loan for debt consolidation, if not a separate loan, which we included details for. When it comes to debt consolidation loans, the best company depends on your credit score and your preferences. Our pick for the best debt consolidation loan for high credit scores is LightStream because those who qualify can get low interest rates. To find the best personal loans for debt consolidation, we combed through the fine print and terms of about a dozen personal loans to find the ones that were best suited to help with consolidating debt. We considered four main features: See our ratings methodology for personal loans » We consulted loan and financial planning experts to inform these picks and give their insights into finding the best loans for your needs. You can read their advice at the bottom of this post. Andre Jean-Pierre: \"One of the most important factors to consider in a personal loan is the interest rate. Because personal loans are typically unsecured, they usually carry higher interest rates than secured lending options. However, if a person has a strong credit profile, a personal loan can carry a lower APR than other unsecured sources of financing such as credit cards.\" Forrest McCall: \"One of the best ways to use a personal loan is to pay off other high-interest debts like credit card debts. Because you can often lock in lower rates than a revolving line of credit like a credit card it can be a smart decision for your finances and save you thousands in interest payments over time.\" Fred Winchar: \"Whether or not to take a personal loan depends on if one can afford it. The purpose of the loan and the value that comes with it is of importance to note. In most cases, it is beneficial to use the loan to invest in a project that can bring extra income or savings.\" Ryan Wangman: \"Borrowers should carefully consider alternatives to personal loans before taking one out. Personal loans can come with high interest rates, especially for borrowers with poor credit. If you can't fit those monthly payments into your budget, steer clear of the loan.\" Jump to",

We comparedSoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)to two popular online banks with separate checking and savings accounts: Chime and Ally. SoFi has a hybrid savings/checking account, so it could be more appealing than Ally if you are looking for an all-in-one account. Ally may be more suitable than SoFi if you want a variety of bank account options — it offers CDs and a money market account, which SoFi doesn't have. SoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)offers a higher interest rate on savings balances than theAlly Savings Accountif you set up direct deposit or deposit minimum $5,000 per month. Ally may be a better option if you don't want to set up a direct deposit, though. TheAlly Savings Accountpays a flat interest rate of 3.80% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), while SoFi members only earn up to 1.20% APY on savings balances when they don't have qualifying activities. Ally is also a better choice if you don't want to deal with out-of-networkbank ATM fees. The bank doesn't charge a fee for using an out-of-network ATM, and you'll get up to $10 per month in reimbursements if an ATM charges you a fee. Meanwhile, SoFi won't reimburse out-of-network ATM charges. Ally Bank Review Chime offers a checking and savings account. Both SoFi and Chime charge zero monthly service fees and require no minimum opening deposit, which is great if you're looking for accounts with lenient opening requirements. SoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)currently pays a higher interest rate on savings balances than theChime Savings Accountif you have qualifying activities; Chime offers an interest rate of 2.00% APY. If you do not want to set up a direct deposit or add qualifying deposits, then Chime may be more appealing. However, you would need to openChime® Checking Accountbefore opening theChime Savings Account. Chime Review At Business Insider, we rate bank accounts on a scale from one to five stars.

It earns bonus points on a wide variety of travel and dining purchases and offers strong travel and purchase coverage, including primary car rental insurance. Earn 5x miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals, and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.

The annual fee is high, but you get a long list of benefits such as airport lounge access, travel statement credits, and more. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is our top-choice travel rewards credit card for most people based on generous benefits and a reasonable $95 annual fee. The Sapphire Preferred Card earns 5x points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠ (2x points on all other travel purchases) and 3x points on dining instead of the Reserve's 5x total points on air travel and 10x total points on hotels and car rentals purchased through Chase Travel℠ (after earning the $300 travel credit) and 3x points on other travel and dining. Points are worth 1.25 cents apiece on travel booked through Chase, and you can transfer them to airline and hotel partner loyalty programs. You don't receive an annual travel credit, but you'll still have car rental primary coverage, as well as trip delay coverage and purchase protection. And each year on your account anniversary, you'll receive a points bonus equal to 10% of all purchases made in the previous year. We previously recommended the Chase Sapphire Reserve® as the best travel card, but switched to recommending the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card due to its annual fee increase, to $550 a year. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card can be a great travel rewards starter card until you travel enough to utilize premium benefits like airport lounge access on a regular basis. If you eventually decide that the Chase Sapphire Reserve is worth it, you can downgrade the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card to a Chase Freedom Unlimited® and apply for the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Expert Tip:The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card comes with an annual statement credit of up to $50 for hotels booked through the Chase Travel℠ Portal and a 10% anniversary points bonus. Read ourChase Sapphire Preferred card review. Apply for theChase Sapphire Preferred® Card. If you're new to credit card travel rewards, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is an excellent starting point. It offers a generous welcome bonus of 75,000 miles once you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening (worth $1,275 based on Business Insider's valuation of Capital One miles). This card's straightforward earning structure and its flexibility in redeeming rewards are very appealing for people who value simplicity. Cardholders earn 5x miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through the Capital One Travel Portal and 2x miles on all other purchases. On the redemption side, you can keep it simple by using your Capital One miles to offset travel purchases made with your card at a rate of 1 cent per mile — no fussing with award charts or availability. Alternatively, you can transfer your miles to Capital One's airline and hotel partners to book award travel and potentially get even more value. You'll also get an impressive range of perks, including up to $120 in credit toward the Global Entry orTSA PreCheck®application fee, car rental insurance, travel accident insurance, purchase assurance, lost luggage reimbursement, and more. Read ourCapital One Venture card review. Apply for theCapital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. The Platinum Card® from American Express has a high $695 annual fee, but offers a long list of benefits to match. The Amex Platinum Card is also one of the best options for paying for flights because you'll earn 5x Membership Rewards points on airfare purchased directly with airlines and with American Express Travel (starting January 1, 2021, earn 5x points on up to $500,000 on these purchases per calendar year). Like Chase Ultimate Rewards points, you can use Amex Membership Rewards points to purchase travel, gift cards, or products directly from the issuer, or transfer points to partner airline and hotel loyalty programs. The best value comes from that latter use. If you redeem points by using them to book flights through Amex, you'll get a value of 1 cent per point. The Platinum Card® from American Express gives you access to the same Priority Pass airport lounges (enrollment required) as the Sapphire Reserve, plus Delta Sky Clubs when you fly Delta, as well as the proprietary American Express Centurion Lounges. Amex Platinum Card members also get exclusive access to major events and experiences, including once-in-a-lifetime \"By Invitation Only\" events. Of course, $695 is a lot to shell out each year. Up to $200 inannual airline fee credits** and up to $200 in annual Uber Cash credits (including Uber Eats)** certainly help offset that cost, but the airline credit can be difficult to use if you aren't checking bags or buying drinks on flights. Additional Benefits:The Platinum Card® from American Express has a slew of other benefits, some that require enrollment: Read ourAmerican Express Platinum card reviewhere.

Capital One's travel rewards program has become very competitive, with expanded card benefits, new transfer partners, and occasional transfer bonuses. The transfer value has improved as well, with most partners offering a 1:1 transfer ratio, and Capital One miles are easy to earn and redeem. Along with earning 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, 5 miles per dollar on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel, and 2x miles on all other purchases, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card comes with top-notch benefits. Cardholders receive $300 per year in credits toward travel booked through Capital One, Priority Pass and Capital One airport lounge access (even for authorized users), a 10,000-mile bonus on each account anniversary (worth $100 in travel), and Visa Infinite travel and purchase benefits. You can redeem miles at a fixed rate toward a statement credit to cover travel purchases with Capital One. For example, if you buy a $500 plane ticket, you can apply 50,000 miles to cancel that charge. Or, for potentially even more value, you can transfer miles to over a dozen Capital One airline and hotel partners. Expert Insight:Capital One launched the Capital One Premier Collection, a luxury hotel booking program, for Venture X cardholders, as well as new Capital One Landing airport lounges for cardholders beginning in 2023.

All the other top picks in this guide earn credit card rewards that can be redeemed in a variety of ways, and they're especially valuable when you redeem for travel. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is a cash rewards card, on the other hand — this option may be a better option if you prefer the ultimate in flexible rewards or don't know for sure that you'll be traveling (rates and fees). Cardholders earn 2% cash rewards on purchases, and there's a solid welcome bonus offer of $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first three months from account opening. On top of that, the card offers a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 12 months from account opening (then a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR). The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is a great choice if you want a card that earns a high rate of cash rewards without having to worry about keeping track of bonus categories. If you want to get maximum value out of your spending, a rewards card will get you a higher return. For instance, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card earns 2x miles on non-bonus purchases, but 2x miles isn't equal to 2% cash back. Our points and miles valuations peg Capital One miles at 1.7 cents each, because you can redeem them for travel through a variety of airline and hotel programs. Travel redemptions will usually get you more than 1 cent per mile or point in value. But if cash back is the most useful to you, this probably doesn't matter.

With 5x points on air travel and 10x points on hotels and car rentals purchased through Chase Travel℠ (after earning the $300 travel credit), 3x points on other travel and dining, and 1 point per dollar on everything else, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® makes it easy to maximize your everyday spending, and it comes with a slew of perks. It used to be our top travel rewards card pick, but now that it has a $550 annual fee, it's harder to recommend to everyone. The Chase Sapphire Reserve's annual fee is offset by a travel credit of up to $300 each year, good for things like taxis, subway fares, parking, tolls, and flights. You'll have to decide whether the card's other benefits are worth it for you. You now get a complimentary two-year Lyft Pink All Access membership, $5 per month in DoorDash in-app credit (along with complimentary DoorDash DashPass membership through December 31, 2027). If you use these services frequently you may be able to justify the higher annual fee — but that's not the case for everyone. Check out our guide to thebest travel credit cardsfor more options like the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Read ourChase Sapphire Reserve credit card reviewhere. Expert Insight:The Chase Sapphire Reserve® offers access toChase Sapphire Lounges, now open in Hong Kong (HKG), Boston (BOS), LaGuardia (LGA), and John F. Kennedy (JFK) in New York. Cardholders also get access to the Chase Sapphire Terrace at Austin airport. Apply for theChase Sapphire Reserve®. The American Express® Gold Card earns a massive 4 Membership Rewards® points on purchases at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 4 points at US supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 3 points on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com, 2 points on prepaid hotels and other eligible purchases booked on AmexTravel.com, and 1 point on all other eligible purchases. Since you can easily redeem Amex points formore than 1 cent of valueeach when you transfer them to airline and hotel partners, this is one of the highest-earning available cards for everything food-related. The American Express® Gold Card has an annual fee of $325 but offers up to $120 in dining credits per year (after enrollment), broken into chunks of $10 each month. Credits are good for purchases at Grubhub, The Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and Five Guys. Cardholders also receive up to $120 per year in Uber Cash, also broken into $10 each month (this is only applicable to U.S. Eats orders and Rides, and the card needs to be added as a method of payment to the Uber app to receive the Uber Cash benefit). Read ourAmex Gold card review. Apply for theAmerican Express® Gold Card. Viewrates and fees. The Save Wealth Premium has the potential to earn an extremely high rate of return. But it also comes with a whopping $750 annual fee and some risk. This card is unique because your rewards come in the form of investment dividends. Whenever you spend money on the card, the fintech company backing this card, Save, purchases stocks worth a little over double what you spent. After the investment has had time to grow — typically a little bit past the one-year mark —  Save deposits the returns on that investment into your linked bank account, minus a 0.79% management fee. You can either choose your own investments, or let Save choose for you, and the company estimates an average return rate of 5.7% per dollar spent. This strategy is unique in the reward space and can be a good option for people who are comfortable allowing the stock market to dictate their spending returns. It's also worth noting that you'll never lose money on your rewards, but you might end up with low to no rewards if the market takes a downturn. So we only recommend this card for people who don't mind trusting chance with their earnings. Read more in ourSave Wealth Premium credit card review. Rewards credit cards give you something back for every dollar you spend — whether that's points or miles for travel, or cash back that you can use to lower your monthly bill or to treat yourself to a splurge. To get the credit card you want, you'll need to have agood credit scoreat least, and ideally, anexcellent credit score. You are most likely be approved for a credit card if your credit profile shows a lowcredit utilization ratio. If you currently carry a balance on an existing credit card, prioritizepaying off that debtas soon as possible before getting a new card to bring your credit score back up. Always pay off your balance in full, since any rewards you could earn will be wiped out by high interest rates from your existing card debt. Credit card rewards typically fall into a few categories. You can choose from flat-rate rewards, tiered bonus categories, cards that reward you for additional banking relationships, and rotating category cards. You can also choose between earning cash back or points and miles. In addition, many cards offer high welcome bonuses to new cardholders who meet a spending requirement in the first few months after opening a card. Some cards also include benefits like travel and purchase protection. The best way to optimize rewards card benefits is by making sure each dollar you spend earns at least 1.5 cents or more in value. You can do this by combining several credit cards in your wallet for different expenses — theAmerican Express® Gold Cardfor groceries and restaurants, for example, plus theChase Sapphire Preferred® Cardfor flights and hotels. Wondering what your rewards can buy? Some cards offer as many as 14 points per dollar on certain categories, but the points multiplier is only half of the equation. You also need to know how much each point is worth. Check out Business Insider's guide towhat points and miles are worthto understand how many cents you'll get in value with different loyalty currencies. These valuations are based on all the different ways you can use a given type of points or miles, from redeeming them as statement credits to transferring them to a travel partner to book a flight. This guide can help you find your best reward credit card if you already know what you want. But what if you're not sure which type of credit card best suits your spending habits? If you want to maximize rewards on your everyday spending, look no further than the following credit cards. We'll break it down by spending category — from dining to gas to groceries. Many people spend thousands of dollars on restaurants yearly, and many cards offer generous dining rewards. The true value depends on how much that reward currency is worth. We ranked some of thebest dining credit cardsin order of highest to lowest return based on how many rewards you earn per dollar spent, and the value of those rewards based on our estimations. The Bilt Mastercard is a great option if you strategically dine out on the first of each month to take advantage of 6x dining returns. But the American Express® Gold Card, Chase Sapphire Reserve®, or Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card are better if you prefer to earn Amex or Chase points. If you have a car, gas or EV charging may be a big spending category for you. Manycash-back credit cardsearn bonus points here: Again, not all points are created equal, and the value you get from points depends on how you redeem your rewards. Most people will find the most value using the American Express® Business Gold Card for gas rewards. But if you're saving up your Hilton points for a high-end resort in the Maldives, for example, it could be worth channeling gas spend toward theHilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card. Earning 4 points on the first $25,000 spent each year at U.S. supermarkets, the American Express® Gold Card offers the most generous payout on grocery spending. Considering the average U.S. household spends $4,445 on groceries per year, these limits shouldn't be problematic for most consumers. Earning 6% cash back on the first $6,000 spent, the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express is a good option if you prefer cash back to rewards points. When maxed out, the 6% back equates to $360 cash back, which is enough for most people to book at least a couple of hotel nights or a round-trip transcontinental flight. If you're looking for lots of rewards for flights, The Platinum Card® from American Express is a great choice. The card earns 5x points on flights booked directly with airlines and through Amex Travel. Prepaid hotel bookings made with American Express also earn 5 points on up to $500,000 on these purchases per calendar year). But while this card is a great option, not everyone will get enough value out of the 5x bonus categories to justify its $695 annual fee. The Chase Sapphire Reserve® is a great alternative. While it earns a lower 3x on travel outside the Chase Travel portal, this bonus applies to all travel purchases, not just flights. Plus, the card's annual fee is partially offset by the $300 travel credit. Unlike American Express, Chase doesn't restrict its travel credit to a specific airline. The credit automatically applies to any purchases coded as travel. That's why the Chase Sapphire Reserve® is such a popular card for earning and redeeming travel rewards. Many cash-back credit cards offer at least 1.5% cash back on everything, which is a great benchmark to keep in mind on purchases that aren't eligible for bonus points. The Discover it® Miles is a great option for those looking for a no-annual-fee card with accelerated earning power. Cardholders earn 1.5 miles per dollar spent. Discover will match all the rewards you earn at the end of your first year which can be redeemed for statement credits toward travel purchases or transferred to your bank account. For those looking to maximize long-term earnings, the Chase Freedom Unlimited® is another great option. It earns 1.5% cash back on most things, with bonus cash back on eligible travel and drugstore purchases. If you have aChase credit cardfor travel like the Sapphire Preferred Card or the Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can convert your Freedom Unlimited rewards to fully transferable Ultimate Rewards points. Essentially, you could earn 1.5 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on everything beyond the bonus travel and drugstore categories, which equals a very solid return on every dollar you spend. If you want the flexibility of earning occasional category bonuses, the Chase Freedom Flex®and Discover it® Cash Back are worth considering. Both cards earn 1% cash back along with 5% on select category bonuses. Bonus categories rotate every quarter and cardholders can earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 worth of spending when they activate the bonus each quarter. Be sure to check thecash-back bonus calendar for DiscoverandChase quarterly bonus categoriesfor a better idea of where you can expect to earn more points (for Discover it® Cash Back, you can earn 5% cash back at restaurants, home improvement stores, and select streaming services, January 1 to March 31, 2025, on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). For a more straightforward option, the Citi® Double Cash Cardis solid. Cardholders earn 1% cash back on purchases and another 1% when they pay them off. Because you can convert your cash back to ThankYou points, the Citi® Double Cash Card is a great way to earn 2 ThankYou points on every dollar spent. Rewards credit cards offer various benefits including earning points, miles, or cash back on purchases. These rewards can be redeemed for travel, statement credits, gift cards, and more. Many cards also come with additional perks like travel insurance, purchase protection, and exclusive offers. To maximize your rewards, use your credit card for everyday purchases, pay off your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges, and take advantage of bonus categories and sign-up bonuses. Regularly review your rewards program to ensure you're redeeming points or miles for maximum value. Yes, rewards credit cards can typically be used for a wide range of purchases, including groceries, dining, travel, and online shopping. However, some cards may offer higher reward rates for specific categories, so it's beneficial to choose a card that aligns with your spending habits. Look for a rewards program that offers high earning rates in categories you frequently spend in, flexible redemption options, valuable sign-up bonuses, and additional perks like travel insurance or purchase protection. Also, consider the card's annual fee and whether the rewards and benefits justify the cost. The Chase Ultimate Rewards loyalty program is incredibly flexible and easy for most people to use. A number of credit cards earn Ultimate Rewards points, including our recommendation for the best rewards credit card overall: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is a simple credit card that earns 2% cash rewards on purchases. The best rewards credit card is absolutely worth keeping in your wallet. The right card for you will reward you on everyday purchases, either in the form of cash back or travel rewards. Many credit cards do not charge an annual fee, so you won't have any additional costs to consider.

Best yet, this card earnsChase Ultimate Rewards points, which are extremely valuable for their flexible redemption opportunities.

So if you're worried about not qualifying for a loan or paying a higher interest rate than you can afford, you may consider this option. However, it will take you two to four business days to get your money, which is longer than most of the other lenders on our list. You'll also pay an late fee of 5% of the minimum payment amount or $15 (whichever is greater) of your total loan amount.

OneMain Financial's minimum APR is higher than every other lender on our top picks, but there is no minimum credit score required to apply. That said, if your credit is in particularly rough shape, it may be easier to qualify for a loan with this lender. You may also be able to get your money the same day you apply. OneMain's standout feature is that it offerssecured personal loans(loans backed by collateral such as a house or a car) as well as unsecured personal loans. This is uncommon among personal loan lenders. Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourOneMain Financial Personal Loans review. If you're looking for a personal loan and have bad credit, you'll want to stick to lenders that allow you to prequalify. This allows you to compare interest rates and terms available without affecting your credit score. This is usually a fast process, so you should do so with several lenders. After you've gotten prequalified, compare the offers and choose the one that best suits your needs. To complete thefull loan application processyou'll need documentation, including paperwork like: If you're approved for the loan, the lender will send you final loan documents to sign off on. Make sure to read everything carefully to understand how exactly how much you'll be paying in total for the loan and be absolutely certain you can afford the monthly payments. Whether you're looking for a$5,000 loanor a$10,000 loan, finding a trustworthy lender can help improve your loan experience. To help you make a decision, we've compared each institution's Better Business Bureau score. The BBB measures businesses based on factors like their responsiveness to consumer complaints, truthfulness in advertising, and clarity about business practices. Here is each company's score: All of our top picks are rated A- or higher by the BBB. Keep in mind that a high BBB score does not guarantee a positive relationship with a lender, and that you should continue to do research and talk to others who have used the company to get the most comprehensive information possible. While some personal loan lenders such as Best Egg and Upgrade may accept collateral for a secured loan, which may get you a lower interest rate, most focus on unsecured loans, which are based entirely on your creditworthiness. Secured loans may get you a lower interest rate, but it's important to remember that you risk losing your collateral if you end up in a position where you can't afford the monthly payments. This can be financially devastating if you were to put up your car as collateral. It's also important to predatory lenders that target borrowers with bad credit with loans at exorbitant interest rates that can trap you in a cycle of debt. Payday loans are among the most common examples. They're advertised as fast and helpful ways to get money to cover an unexpected expense but often end up saddling borrowers with loan terms and interest rates that severely damage their long-term financial health. Car title loans, which allow the lender to take ownership of your car if you can't pay, are also frequently associated withpredatory lending. Getting a personal loan with bad credit can help you improve your credit score. While it may sound counterintuitive, there are several ways this can happen based on how credit scores are calculated. For example, when you make payments on a loan, they're reported to the majorcredit bureaus, and your payment history accounts for more than a third of your overall credit score. Making your payments on time will have a positive impact. If you use a personal loan for debt consolidation, it can also help improve your score. With a debt consolidation loan for poor credit, you roll multiple debt into a single loan with one monthly payment. This can reduce yourcredit utilization ratio, which determines about 30% of your credit score. To get the best personal loan for bad credit scores, consider what is most important to you. Many borrowers prioritize thelowest personal loan interest rate, but also consider any fees, the minimum credit score needed, and the accessibility of the lender's customer service. You'll also want to make sure you're able to select a term length that works for you and that your loan's purpose is allowed by the lender you choose. Depending on your situation, you might also look for loans for bad credit with instant approval so you can get the funds as soon as possible. See the latestpersonal loan interest rates» For bad credit loans specifically, you'll want to understand if you qualify for a loan or if you may need to add a cosigner to boost your chances of being eligible. Check forlow interest personal loan offerswithout impacting your credit score. Compare Personal Loan Rates Bad credit loans are aimed at borrowers with low credit scores or limited credit histories (making some of them more attainable loan options for immigrants still establishing credit). Each lender has its own standards to determine whether to offer a loan to those with bad credit, so you should shop around before deciding which one to use. Yes, you can get a loan online even if you have bad credit. Lenders including Avant, LendingPoint, and Upgrade, are among those that offer bad credit loans online. While a bad credit loan can be a solid option to get money fast, there might be cheaper avenues available to you, including: borrowing from friends or family, getting a paycheck advance, and seeking aid from a local nonprofit or charity. There is no such thing as a personal loan with guaranteed approval, and it's important to be cautious of such claims. No legitimate lender can guarantee you'll be approved for a personal loan, especially if you have bad credit. Each personal loan we review has a numerical rating on a 1-5 scale. This rating is a weighted average taking into account several important criteria for choosing the best loan for you: interest rates, fees, term lengths, funding speed, and more. Each category's weighting is based on its importance to your borrowing experience. Rates and fees have the most direct impact on the overall cost of your loan, so we weigh those the most heavily.

Here are Business Insider's picks for the best business credit cards available right now: The best business credit cards for small business owners offer generous rewards on common business expenses, travel and purchase protections and benefits, and other perks that make your busy life a little bit easier. Some of them come with annual fees, but many other great candidates do not, giving you plenty of options. Each of the cards in this guide has been chosen for unique benefits that are valuable beyond standard requirements, such as generous reward rates or an introductory period of zero interest. TheInk Business Preferred® Credit Cardis ideal if you want to earn valuable, flexible rewards points on your business spending through theChase Ultimate Rewards®program. This card consistently offers a generous welcome bonus, although the high spending requirement on this offer may be hard for smaller businesses to meet. If you already hold one of thebest Chase cardsfor consumers that earn these rewards, such as theChase Sapphire Preferred® CardorChase Sapphire Reserve®,you'll earn even more by adding this small business credit card to your wallet. Like the Sapphire cards mentioned above, the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points. You can either keep the rewards you earn on your Ink card separate from the rest of your Ultimate Rewards stash, or you can transfer the points to your personal credit cards. These points can be traded for cash back ortransferred to Ultimate Rewards partnerssuch as United Airlines or Marriott Hotels. If you transfer your Ultimate Rewards points to a personal card to purchase travel through Chase, you can get a 25% bonus if you use your personal Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, or a 50% bonus if you move your Ink points to your Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. What our experts love:Generous welcome offer, cellphone protection, and great rewards on travel, shipping, and advertising spend. What our experts don't love:This card has an annual fee, which may deter business owners who don't want to pay money to hold a credit card. Read ourChase Ink Business Preferred card reviewto learn more about this card. The Business Platinum Card® from American Express is the business version of the famousAmex Platinum Card,and was Business Insider's former top-choice business card. However, this card's annual fee has increased since then, and it's become a bit more of a niche product. The Business Platinum Card® from American Express is potentially useful for midsize businesses that spend a lot on flights and travel, but less valuable for sole proprietors and smaller companies. The Business Platinum Card® from American Express benefits include 1.5 points earning categories: U.S. construction material, hardware suppliers, electronic goods retailers, software and cloud system providers, and shipping providers, as well as on purchases of $5,000 or more, on up to $2 million of these purchases per card account per calendar year. Finally, cardholders can also enroll in annual statement credits for wireless, Indeed, Adobe purchases, and Dell. This card offers many luxury perks includingairport lounge access, generous statement credits, and 5Amex Membership Rewards pointson flights and prepaid hotels when you book throughAmerican Express Travel. However, the annual fee is quite steep, and smaller companies may struggle to meet the spending requirement for the welcome bonus. What the experts love:Luxury travel benefits, 5 points on flights booked through Amex Travel, and airport lounge access. What the experts don't love:The high annual fee offsets potential benefits for smaller companies. Read ourAmex Business Platinum card reviewto learn more about this card. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is a good choice if you prefer straightforward cash-back earning without having to worry about keeping track of bonus categories. Business Insider considers it to be thebest 2% cash back credit cardfor small business owners. With this card, you earn 2% cash back on all eligible purchases, on the first $50,000 spent per calendar year, then 1% back (cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit). It's hard to beat earning 2% cash back on all purchases on up to $50,000 spent per year (then 1%) with no annual fee, and azero-interest credit cardwith an introductory 0% APR can give you some breathing room to pay off those big purchases over time at no additional cost. For small businesses with big expenses on the horizon, there's a 0% intro APR on purchases for 12 months from account opening (then a 17.49% - 25.49% Variable APR,rates and fees) that can help you save some money on interest, as well. New cardholders can also earn $250 statement credit after you make $3,000 in purchases on your card in your first three months of account opening. What the experts love:2% cash back on everything with no annual fee (rates and fees), a solid welcome offer, and a 0% intro APR period. What the experts don't love:Rewards are capped at 1% cash back after the first $50,000 spent each year. Read ourAmex Blue Business Cash card reviewto learn more about this card. The Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card is a simple one at first glance, earning unlimited 1.5% cash back. However, just like the consumerChase Freedom Flex®and Chase Freedom Unlimited® cards, the Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card has a trick up its sleeve. Although the card is marketed as \"cash back,\" it earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points that you can redeem for cash (1 point = 1 cent). That means that you can combine the points earned from the Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card with the ones you earn from cards like the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card, or the personal Chase Sapphire Reserve® or Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, and either earn a bonus when you redeem them for travel through Chase, or transfer them to travel partners. When those points are combined onto an Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card, you'll get a guaranteed 1.5 to 3 points per dollar spent. The card also offers a 0% intro APR on purchases for the first 12 months on purchases, followed by a 17.49% - 23.49% Variable APR, so it's a good choice if you have expenses coming up that you want to spread out over time. What the experts love:The welcome bonus offer is especially impressive for a no-annual-fee card. What the experts don't love:This card isn't as valuable on its own — you need to hold another Chase card to maximize your rewards. Read ourChase Ink Business Unlimited credit card reviewto learn more about this card. It's a rare points-earning business card that doesn't charge an annual fee (rates and fees). But with The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express, you'll earn 2 points per dollar on the first $50,000 you spend each calendar year, without any bonus categories you need to track.

The Capital One Spark Miles Select for Business† recently increased its welcome bonus to 50,000 miles after spending $4,500 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. That's a rare deal from a no-annual-fee business card, and more than double the usual offer. Cardholders earn 1.5 miles per dollar on purchases (except hotels and car rentals booked through Capital One Travel, which earn 5 miles per dollar). There are no pesky foreign transaction fees to worry about, and you'll get a few travel benefits, including roadside assistance and secondary car rental insurance. The redemption options on this card are similar to that of its big sibling, the Capital One Spark Miles for Business†. Based on Business Insider's valuations, you can expect to get around $850 in travel from this card's bonus. What the experts love:A strong welcome bonus and earning for no annual fee make the card an affordable entry point if you're interested in earning credit card rewards for travel.

Read ourCapital One Spark Miles Select for Business reviewto learn more about this card. If you don't want to pay the Amex Business Platinum Card's higher annual fee, the American Express® Business Gold Card is a good alternative. And depending on your spending habits, the Business Gold could be a more rewarding choice, thanks to the ability to earn 4x points on popular business spending categories on the first $150,000 in combined purchases each calendar year in the two select categories where your business spent the most each month; then 1x. Eligible 4x categories are: This card currently comes with a big welcome offer of 100,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $15,000 on eligible purchases with the card within the first three months of card membership (worth $1,800 based on Business Insider's valuations). Cardholders also receive a decent selection of travel and shopping perks. What the experts love:Generous bonus categories that reward your biggest areas of spend. What the experts don't love:This card is the only premium Amex card that doesn't offer a statement credit to offset the annual fee.

As with the Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card, you can pool the \"cash\" you earn with points from a points-earning card, effectively converting your cash into (potentially) more valuable points.

We cover some of the top questions and concerns about maximizing your benefits and protections. We recommend matching card features to your business spending and growth plans to identify the best option for you. In addition to providing our expert take on the best cards available right now, our credit card experts also compiled customer experiences and reviews across forums such as Reddit and FlyerTalk to see what other business owners have to say. Many business owners like the flexibility of earning cash back because it's so versatile. Travel rewards are often worth more when compared to the cash value of business- and first-class flights and five-star hotel stays, but cash back is the easiest and most quantifiable way to calculate true value. Some Redditors appreciate payment flexibility features that are unique to small business credit cards. For example, The Plum Card® from American Expressoffers a 1.5% discount if you pay off what you owe before it's due. However, Business Insider's credit card experts don't recommendThe Plum Cardfor most business owners because it has a relatively high annual fee of $250 in exchange for minimal benefits beyond the early-pay discount. Many business credit cardholders mention the value of a credit card 0% intro APR, whether it's for purchases, balance transfers, or both. Zero-interest terms allow business owners to pay down large expenses, such as new equipment or commercial rent, over a longer period of time without incurring additional costs in the form of interest. Of course, after the initial period ends, you'll return to paying high rates of interest, so make sure you plan ahead to pay off the full amount you owe before your 0% APR term runs out. Many small business owners look for business credit cards that earn points or cash back within the same issuer \"ecosystems\" that they already use for personal credit cards. For example, many people who have one or more of thebest Chase cardsfor consumers gravitate toward thebest Chase business credit cardsbecauseearning and using Chase Ultimate Rewards pointsis easy between business and personal accounts. The best business credit cards often earn bonus rewards on specific purchases that pair well with benefits or bonus categories on personal cards.American Express credit cardswork well together, just like Chase cards do. For example, The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express pairs well with theAmerican Express® Gold CardandThe Platinum Card® from American Express, which are two of the most popular consumer credit cards offered through Amex. Business owners who bank with Bank of America have access to theBank of America Preferred Rewards loyalty program benefits, which earns additional cash back depending on how much money you deposit with Bank of America or Merrill. People who value cash back frequently tout the benefits of combining a cash-back credit card like the Bank of America® Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards Mastercard® Credit Cardwith otherBank of Americabanking accounts. Business road warriors rave about travel-related benefits associated with certain business credit cards such as access to airport lounges, earning miles on travel purchases, and additional perks like priority boarding and free checked bags. We've highlighted the premium benefits of The Business Platinum Card® from American Express and the everyday rewards from The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express in this guide, but you may also want to consider other options if you frequently find yourself traveling for business. Many of the cards Redditors recommend are featured in our guide to thebest business credit cards for travel. Few people get excited about accounting tools and features, but they can be a lifesaver for managing and organizing business expenses. Redditors emphasized the importance of finding business credit cards that offer authorized user and employee credit cards, or integrate with Quickbooks and other common accounting software tools for accurate cash flow management and efficient financial tracking. Business credit cards also help users separate business expenses from personal finances, which is important for clean accounting and for establishing business credit. Many small business credit cards rely on consumer credit scores for approval, so business owners with low personal credit may find it hard to get approved for a business credit card. Secured business credit cards can be the solution here. The best options help businesses build credit history by reporting responsible use to business credit bureaus, and some offer the option to upgrade to an unsecured card for better credit with responsible use. Redditors who don't otherwise qualify for business credit cards recommend looking at several of the cards in our guide to thebest secured business credit cards. These cards require a cash security deposit, which usually equates to the credit limit you want to set on the credit card. The FoundersCard program is a paid membership that offers access to exclusive discounts and premium benefits for movers and shakers.

Joining FoundersCard doesn't come cheap, costing several hundred dollars each year depending on which membership tier you choose. But it can be worth many times its annual fee for the right demographic: people who frequently travel for business and pleasure, and value premium experiences and top-tier service while doing so. Our dedicated review delves deeper intowhat FoundersCard is and whether it's worththe investment. Some of the best credit cards for small businesses include the Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card for earning 1.5% back on every dollar spent; The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card for earning 2x Amex points per dollar spent; the U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite Mastercard® for a long 0% intro APR period and generous rewards rate; and The Business Platinum Card® from American Express for premium travel perks including access to the American Express Centurion Lounges in airports worldwide. Business credit cards offer detailed expense tracking, help in building business credit, and provide rewards tailored to business spending like travel, office supplies, and telecommunications. Yes, startups can qualify for business credit cards. Some cards are designed with new businesses in mind, offering features that cater to the needs of startups. Depending on how the card is set up with the credit bureau, activity on a business credit card might not affect your personal credit score directly unless you default. Look for cards offering travel rewards, no foreign transaction fees, travel insurance, and airport lounge access to maximize travel benefits. Generally, rewards are not taxable as they are considered discounts or rebates on spending. However, large sign-up bonuses may sometimes be viewed differently, so it's advisable to consult with a tax professional. While personal credit cards are intended for any type of purchase, business credit cards are targeted toward business owners. That doesn't mean you need a large established company to apply for a business credit card. In fact, you can may qualify for a business card as long as you meet the bank's application requirements, even if you just resell household items on eBay or operate a small home baking business. It's easier to qualify for a business credit card than you may think. If you do any freelancing or a side gig, such as driving for Uber or selling items on eBay, you can typically qualify for a business credit card as a sole proprietor. In this case, you are personally on the hook for your business' debts. You can apply for a business card using your Social Security number if you're a sole proprietor. You should put down your legal name as the business name. If you have a business with employees, you'll need to answer questions about your business size, type, and revenue, in addition to providing your SSN and your EIN (if requested). With a business credit card, the primary cardholder is responsible for the debts on the card and for any fees that are incurred. A corporate card is issued by a company to its employees, and the company is responsible for paying that card. Business Insider's personal finance experts evaluated dozens of business credit cards currently open to new applicants to determine the best options for most business owners.

Checking account monthly service fee:no monthly service fee Experian Smart Money Review Banks typically offer bonuses on checking accounts to draw in new customers. Bonuses also help create a distinction between competing banks that may offer similar interest rates, monthly fees, or opening deposit requirements. Current bank account promotion offers range from $50 to $4,000. Generally, brick-and-mortar banks are more likely to offer bank account bonuses to new customers than online banks or banking platforms. In addition to the tips mentioned below, make sure you qualify to open a bank account at a specific financial institution. You typically need a U.S. ID and Social Security number to apply for an account. However, if you are unbanked because you don't have a U.S. ID, know that you have options. Thetop banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizensallow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular to open a bank account. The first step to qualifying for a checking account bonus is opening your account under the correct conditions. You must apply through a bank promotional page or use a special code to open a bank account through a bank representative. If you open a bank account without these conditions, you won't be able to get the bonus. Each financial institution will list certain requirements you must meet by a specified timeframe. You might need to make a direct deposit or transfer, maintain a specific daily balance, and/or enroll in online banking to get the bonus. Some banks may also require a combination of these requirements. Generally, bank accounts with higher cash bonuses will have harder bonus criteria to meet. For example, you may need to deposit $25,000 or more in your account within the first 90 days and maintain that balance amount for a few months. The disclosure at the bottom of a promotional page will provide more details to help you understand the qualification criteria. For example, many disclosures outline who can qualify for a bonus and who can't. It will also tell you which specific transactions are eligible to meet the requirements. Make sure you read that to see if you truly qualify. Once you've completed all the requirements specified by the bank, the bonus will be deposited into your account. You'll also need to keep your bank account open for a certain time period to keep the bonus and avoid paying an early account closure fee. A few financial institutions, like Chase and SoFi®, have bank account bonuses for existing customers. Banks typically offer existing customers bank promotions when they want you to upgrade to a premium bank account with higher minimum balance requirements or utilize a specific banking feature. For example, you might be asked to set updirect deposits. Remember, though, that most bonus promotions are for new bank account customers. Some banks will still let you qualify as a new customer if you've opened a bank account with them in the past, but they'll list a specific time that needs to have passed. Checking account bonuses are taxable. Similar to interest, any money that you earn from a checking account is taxed as ordinary income. The exact rate you'll pay depends onwhich tax bracket you're in, which can range anywhere from 10% to 37%. You have to pay taxes on checking account bonuses by Tax Day in April. At the beginning of the year, banks will usually send a1099-INT formby mail which you can use when filing your tax return. Even if you don't receive this form, you should still include the bonus in your tax return. Evaluating the best bank promotion deals requires more than simply checking the bonus requirements. After all, you want to make sure that yourbank account bonus is worth itand that the account actually fits your needs. Here are three steps you can take to choose the best bank bonus offer. Think about whichtypes of checking accountyou want and where you want to get it. Do you want a traditional checking account at a brick-and-mortar bank or a rewards checking account from an online bank? Are you looking for an everyday banking option that has minimal maintenance requirements, or do you want to get a premium bank account that offers more rewards for maintaining a high account balance? Once you've narrowed down your options, review a couple of institutions to see if bonuses are available. For example, you'll likely find several offers if you want a traditional checking account with a national brick-and-mortar bank. You can compare the requirements and cash bonus values and see if there's a standout option. When you're opening a checking account, you shouldn't just look at the bonus. Think about whether this account actually fits your needs and if there are any features outside of the bonus that actually appeal to you. For example, some checking accounts have early pay features so you can get paycheck direct deposits ahead of payday. Typcially, you can get early direct deposits up to two days early at many brick-and-mortar and online banks. Other features that can significantly impact your banking experience are the bank's online and mobile banking tools. The banks with thebest mobile banking appshave tools to help you manage your spending and savings. For example, you might be able to create individual savings goals or track monthly spending. Some apps also have strong security features, so you can lock your debit card or get information about how to improve your security when you log into your account online. You don't want to open a bank account at a financial institution where you'll have to pay exorbitant bank fees because it isn't a good fit.Common bank feesyou'll find include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, ATM fees, and early account closure fees. Make sure you meet the requirements to waive fees on your account. For example, many banks let you waive fees onmonthly bank maintenance feesif you maintain a certain daily account balance. Otherwise, you might be better off getting afree checking account, so you can properly maintain your account without facing common bank charges. You can waiveATM feesby sticking primarily to your bank's ATM network. Some banks also offer ATM fee reimbursements, so you can get refunded for charges from outside providers. There's usually a monthly ATM fee reimbursement limit, typically only up to $10 or $20 per month. If you are concerned about overdrawing from your account, you choose a bank that offersoverdraft protection. Coverage for overage varies by bank, but the best is a free option that lets you link your checking to your savings account. In addition to reviewing bank account fees, assess other bank accounts and services. If you're looking to buy a home or open acredit cardsoon, it may be worthwhile to check out a bank to see if it could be a good option for future goals. Here are tips you can use to maximize a bank account bonus: We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best bank account bonus for your needs. Here's what they had to say about bank account bonuses. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What should I look for in a checking account bonus? Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: \"If you are using this bank as your main spending account, then you know that you will have less conflict with depositing money in there. It may be beneficial to look at specific things that are getting bonuses, specifically direct deposit.\" Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,Business Insider: \"I would consider how much money is needed to obtain the bonus. Some banks may have several bonuses available, where you'll earn bigger bonuses for a higher account balance or direct deposit. See if a particular bonus is right for you and you're not going out of your way to qualify for it.\" At Business Insider, our personal finance team aims to create helpful content so you can make wise money decisions. Our team is editorially independent, which means our editorial team chooses how we cover and review products. Our business does not decide that. You can read oureditorial standards pageto learn more about how we review and choose products. To choose the best checking account bonuses, we reviewed national banks, regional banks, and credit unions to find out which ones offered existing bonuses. Then, we looked at the criteria for getting the bonuses as well as the overall bank account structure. We included bank account bonuses where the checking account has at least 3.5/5 stars. In ourbank account methodology, we rate all checking accounts on a scale from one to five stars. One star is the lowest rating and five stars is the highest possible rating. Specifically for checking accounts, we review minimum opening deposit requirements, monthly service fees, overdraft protection, and fees, ATM network and fees, customer support availability, mobile app rating, miscellaneous features, and company ethics and security. We score each of these features on a scale of zero to five, then calculate the weighted average to get an account's final rating.

The average cost of renters insurance in the US is about $15 per month, or $173 a year, according to 2020 data from the Insurance Information Institute. Premiums may vary based on zip code, any history of claims, and more. You could get additional savings by bundling your renters insurance policy with car insurance or other types of insurance. The cheapest renters insurance tends to vary based on location, so it's worth getting quotes from a few different companies. Overall, though, Lemonade tends to offer cheap rates across the US. People may opt to not get renters insurance by simply overlooking its importance, or if they incorrectly think their valuables are covered by the landlord's building insurance. Anyone with items of value in their apartment should get renters insurance to protect their belongings.

However, our opinions are our own. Seehow we rate credit cards to write unbiased product reviews. The information for the following product(s) has been collected independently by Business Insider: Chase Freedom Flex®. The details for these products have not been reviewed or provided by the issuer.  As Business Insider's correspondent covering all things credit cards, I'm often a resource for friends and family members looking to get a new card. Many people focus on credit card rewards above all else, but I primarily recommend the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card for its fantastic benefits, including travel reimbursements for flight cancellations and lost bags, primary rental car insurance coverage, a $50 annual hotel credit, and bonus points on dining and travel. Business Insider's personal finance experts agree: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is an industry leader across several of our credit card guides, topping our lists of thebest credit cards, thebest rewards credit cards, and thebest travel rewards credit cards. Earn 5 points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠. Earn 3 points on dining, select streaming services and online groceries. Earn 2 points on all other travel purchases. Earn 1 points on all other purchases. $95 N/A 20.49% - 27.49% Variable Earn 60,000 bonus points Good to Excellent If you're new to travel rewards credit cards or just don't want to pay hundreds in annual fees, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is a smart choice. It earns bonus points on a wide variety of travel and dining purchases and offers strong travel and purchase coverage, including primary car rental insurance. The Sapphire Preferred Card earns bonus points on various travel and dining purchases. But this card's travel insurance protections are its most valuable benefit. These protections include primary car rental coverage, as well as trip cancellation and interruption insurance. If that sounds like a bunch of gibberish, here's what that really means: If someone dents my rental car while it's in my possession, I can file a claim through Chase instead of my personal car insurance company. If my bags are lost or delayed by an airline, I can buy basic necessities like toothpaste or extra socks and get reimbursed for the money I spend. And if my flight is canceled or delayed overnight or for more than 12 hours, these benefits will cover up to $500 per ticket in unexpected expenses, such as meals and a hotel room, for myself and any travel companions whose tickets were purchased on my credit card. This card also comes with a generous welcome bonus for new cardholders that offsets a reasonable $95 annual fee, making it affordable for most peopl who travel at least once a year. The Sapphire Preferred Card also includes a $50 annual credit for hotels booked through theChase Travel℠ Portal, a 10% anniversary points bonus, and up to 5 points per dollar in popular spending categories. The current Sapphire Preferred Card intro bonus goes a long way: 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. This welcome offer is worth $1,080 in travel, based on Business Insider'spoints and miles valuations. That's enough for a vacation to Hawaii during shoulder season if I'm savvy with my spending. Sapphire Preferred Cardholders earn points at the following rates per dollar spent: If you close your credit card, you'll lose all the points in your account. So, if you cancel this credit card, be sure to redeem your rewards, combine them with rewards on another partner credit card in the Chase family, or transfer them to aChase Ultimate Rewards points partner. I like pairing the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card with a cash-back card from Chase like the Chase Freedom Flex®. Both cards earn Ultimate Rewards, but they have different bonus categories. I can transfer the points from my Chase Freedom Flex® to my Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card for additional value, essentially doubling my stash of rewards. Chase Ultimate Rewards® points are worth 1 cent apiece when redeemed through Chase Travel℠. But Chase Sapphire Preferred® Cardholders get a 25% redemption value bonus, so my rewards are worth 1.25 cents apiece when if I combine my stash before booking travel through Chase. Chase Sapphire Preferred® Cardholders can redeem Ultimate Rewards points for flights, hotels, rental cars, and more through the Chase Travel℠ portal at the 1.25-cent rate with no limits or blackout dates. The redemption system searches many airline and hotel brands, with a similar feel and layout to major discount travel websites. Booking Directly vs. Using A Third-Party Online Travel Agency (OTA) You'll often find cheaper rates from the hotel or airline, and changes or cancellations are trickier if you don't book direct. Most hotel chains also won't let you earn credit toward elite status if you book through a third-party company like Expedia, Travelocity — or Chase Travel℠. That being said, there's always a time and place to use the Chase Travel℠ portal. I typically recommend using the portal to use up travel credit, such as the $50 annual hotel credit for stays booked through Chase. Transferring Ultimate Rewards to Chase partners usually helps you get the most value out of your points.  Chase has 14 different airline and hotel partners, and points transfer at a 1:1 ratio, meaning 1 Chase point equals 1 point or mile in the following programs: There are plenty of non-travel options for redeeming your Chase points. I never recommend doing so because these redemptions are worth far less per point. Paypal and Amazon redemptions are a terrible idea, since you lose 20% of the minimum point value when you use your rewards here. If you want to use your rewards for these merchants, I recommend paying for your purchase with the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, then redeeming your points toward a statement credit at 1 cent apiece. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card's benefits come in handy when traveling and shopping at home, online, or anywhere your travels take you. The Sapphire Preferred Card comes with up to $50 in annual statement credits toward hotel stays booked through Chase Travel℠. You can use this credit immediately if you're a new cardholder, and the credit renews each year after your card renewal anniversary. Even if you hate the idea of paying a credit card annual fee, hear me out: Taking advantage of this $50 annual credit drops the net cost of your $95 annual fee to just $45 every year. Each year on your account anniversary, you'll receive a points bonus equal to 10% of all purchases made in the previous year. For example, if I spend $25,000 on the card in a 12-month period, I'll get a bonus of 2,500 points — enough to get me to New Orleans and back on Southwest during low season. The next few benefits are some of the best perks of the Sapphire Preferred Card. The Sapphire Preferred Card includes primary car rental insurance for damage due to theft or collision. Primary coverage means your credit card benefits kick in before your personalauto insurancepolicy. You don't need to file a claim with your own insurer, which can cost you a lot more in premiums down the road. I've never needed to file a rental car claim using this perk — knock on wood — but plenty of travelers have shared success stories on online forums such as Reddit and FlyerTalk. (Of course, there are plenty of exceptions or misunderstandings as well, so make sure you carefully read your benefit terms and conditions before renting your vehicle as well as if you encounter any issues during the rental period.) This rental car protection benefit also means you can skip purchasing insurance through the car rental agency in most countries when you rent a vehicle and pay with the Sapphire Preferred Card. Most cars and countries are included, but some countries and some car models are excluded from this benefit. So make sure you read the fine print before you waive insurance coverage from the rental car company. For instance, I had to purchase local insurance when I rented a car in Ireland. (I was grateful for the protection while I drove on the left side of those narrow roads!) Note:Your credit card rental car coverage doesn't include liability insurance, which covers claims that result from injuries and damage you or your vehicle may cause to other people or property. If a trip you booked using this card is cut short or canceled for an eligible reason such as illness or severe weather, the travel insurance benefit on this card will reimburse up to $10,000 per person and $20,000 per trip for pre-paid, non-refundable travel expenses. This protection can be especially valuable for pricy or time-specific adventures, which often cannot be rescheduled to a later date. For example, I got really lucky with great weather when I went to Antarctica, but the group of travelers behind me didn't even get to set sail for the continent due to inclement conditions. If one of those travelers had had this credit card, they could have filed a claim for reimbursement if they weren't able to sail on the next cruise offered to them. When you use your Sapphire Preferred Card to pay for airfare, the trip delay insurance benefit can reimburse you for up to $500 per ticket for hotel rooms, food, toiletries, clothes, or other reasonable expenses when your flight is delayed overnight, or by 12 hours or more. If you've paid for your travel with the Sapphire Preferred Card and your bags are delayed for six hours or more, you could be reimbursed for essential purchases such as clothing and toiletries, up to $100 per day for up to five days. I have personally used this Chase protection benefit (on another card) to cover nearly one week's worth of unexpected expenses. I've also helped friends file claims for trip delay expenses during the recent CrowdStrike travel fiasco, helping them reclaim hundreds of dollars' worth of last-minute charges when their airline left them high and dry. If the carrier damages or loses your bags, you and your immediate family members could be covered for up to $3,000 per passenger as long as you've paid for your tickets with the Sapphire Preferred Card. When you purchase certain goods with the Sapphire Preferred Card, the card's warranty benefit extends a U.S. manufacturer's warranty by one additional year on warranties of three years or less. If an eligible item you've bought with the Sapphire Preferred Card is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase, you may be able to claim up to $500 in reimbursement per purchase, and up to $50,000 per credit card account. If you're traveling away from home and need help, cardholder emergency assistance can help you find medical and legal referrals. This service is free for Sapphire Preferred Card cardholders, but any third-party costs are your responsibility. When you pay for your air, bus, cruise, or train transportation with the Sapphire Preferred Card, you're eligible for accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000. Sapphire Preferred Card cardholders can contact the roadside dispatch hotline for help with arranging services like towing and flat tire repair for a set fee. Sapphire Preferred Card get a complimentary DashPass membership (for waived delivery fees on qualifying orders) through December 31, 2027. You have to enroll through Chase to receive this perk. As of Summer 2024, cardholders also get a $10 monthly credit for a grocery, convenience, or retail order. Restaurants aren't included, and you'll often pay hefty service fees for delivery. But I like to maximize this benefit by searching for stores that offer a pick-up option to make the most of my $10 discount. In many cases, 7-Eleven may be the only store in your area that offers pick-up options, but you'd be surprised by how many goodies you can get there with a free $10. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card has a $95 annual fee. Many people preferno-annual-fee credit cards, but I find the peace of mind I get from trip cancellation insurance and primary rental car coverage is worth far more than $95 a year. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card has a 20.49% - 27.49% Variable APR. I always recommend paying off your full statement balance every month, and never charging more to your credit card than you can afford. The interest rate on this card is no exception: Your debt will add up very quickly if you carry a balance at this rate of interest. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card does not charge any foreign transaction fees when you shop outside the U.S. Foreign transaction fees typically cost an additional 3% to 5% on top of your purchase, and I've saved hundreds of dollars over the years by only using credit cards that don't charge these fees. As with most other credit cards, you'll have to pay fees for credit card balance transfers, cash advances, late payments, and returned payments. The Sapphire Preferred Card isn't the only credit card geared to travelers that offers top-notch benefits and generous rewards. Depending on your spending and travel habits, one of these alternative credit cards could be a better fit for you. Pro Tip for Business Owners:You may also want to considerChase Sapphire Preferred vs. Ink Business Preferredto get a better understanding of which card will benefit your personal situation the best.

Cardholders can also redeem Ultimate Rewards through the Chase portal at a value of 1.5 cents apiece, compared to the 1.25 cents apiece for Sapphire Preferred Card. Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders earn 10 points on Lyft rides through March 2025; 10 points on hotels and car rentals booked through Chase; 10 points on Chase Dining; 5 points on airfare through Chase Travel℠; 3 points on other dining and travel; and earn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. Read more in ourChase Sapphire Reserve credit card review. If you want a mid-tier travel credit card that earns American Express Membership rewards, the American Express® Gold Card is a good option for you to consider. Cardholders earn 4 Membership Rewards® points on purchases at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 4 points at US supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 3 points on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com, 2 points on prepaid hotels and other eligible purchases booked on AmexTravel.com, and 1 point on all other eligible purchases New Amex Gold cardholders can earn 60,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $6,000 on eligible purchases on your new card in your first six months of Card Membership, and can benefit from extra perks at Amex Hotel Collection properties when booked through Amex; secondary car rental insurance; trip delay insurance; baggage insurance; extended warranty; purchase protection; and up to $10 in Uber Cash each month after adding the card as a method of payment in your Uber account. American Express® Gold Card cardholders who enroll in the benefit can can also get a $10 monthly dining credit at Grubhub, The Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and Five Guys. This card has an annual fee of $325, which is significantly higher than that of the Sapphire Preferred Card. Read more in ourAmex Gold Card review. The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is nearly identical to the Sapphire Preferred Card, but for people who prefer Capital One as a credit card issuer. New cardholders can earn a welcome bonus of 75,000 miles once you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening. The card has an annual fee of $95, and earns a flat rate of 2 miles per dollar on most purchases. They will earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. If you're still undecided, we have a full breakdown ofChase Sapphire Preferred versus Capital One Venture. Read more in ourCapital One Venture card review. To be eligible to apply for the Sapphire Preferred Card, you have a credit score in the good to excellent range. However, Chase only allows you to have one Sapphire card at a time, so if you already have the card (or its sibling, the Chase Sapphire Reserve®), you won't be approved. For consumers who travel and dine out on occasion, the $95 is worth the annual fee. The annual fee might seem intimidating if you've only hadno-annual-fee cardsin the past, but the card pays for itself pretty quickly with a $50 annual credit for hotels booked through Chase and generous rewards on dining, online groceries, and travel purchases. The Sapphire Preferred Card earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, which you can redeem for travel booked through Chase, statement credits, gift cards, and merchandise. The best way to use your rewards is usually by transferring them to Chase's airline and hotel partners, because you can often get outsized value from your points this way.   The Sapphire Preferred Card does not charge extra to add authorized users. Additional cardholders get their own card, but any points earned from their spending will belong to the primary cardholder. Keep in mind any transactions made by your authorized users are your responsibility, so only add folks you trust. The minimum credit limit for the Sapphire Preferred Card is usually $5,000 because it's a Visa Signature card. Many people get approved for credit limits that are higher than that. The difference between the Sapphire Preferred and Reserve is that the Sapphire Preferred Card is a mid-tier card with a $95 annual fee and generous rewards for spending. The Chase Sapphire Reserve® is a premium card meant for frequent travelers, and comes with upscale benefits and rewards in exchange for a $550 annual fee. You can upgrade the Sapphire Preferred Card if you've had it for at least a year. Should you decide it's not a good fit, you can call Chase and ask to product change to a different personal Chase Ultimate Rewards earning card. For example, if you find yourself traveling more often and want perks like Priority Pass airport lounge access, you could ask for an upgrade to the Chase Sapphire Reserve®. You can downgrade the Sapphire Preferred Card if you've had it for at least a year. If you find that paying the Sapphire Preferred Card's annual fee isn't worth it for you, you could request a downgrade to the no-annual-fee Chase Freedom Flex® or Chase Freedom Unlimited®. No, the Sapphire Preferred Card doesn't come with a TSA PreCheck® or Global Entry credit. However, its sibling, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, does offer this feature. You can find more options in our guide to thebest credit cards with Global Entry and TSA PreCheck®credits.

You may prefer one of our top options if you are looking for more lenient opening requirements. Keep in mind that the APY also drops to 0.25% APY on balances above $250,000.

The BBB measures businesses by looking at responses to customer complaints, honesty in advertising, and transparency about business practices. Vio Bank is a division of MidFirst Bank, so we included the BBB rating for MidFirst Bank. Since thePatriot Bank N.A. Money Market Deposit Accountis available through Raisin, we included Raisin's BBB rating. Here are the BBB scores for the other institutions on our list: TotalBank has anA- ratingfrom the BBB because it hasn't responded to a complaint filed against it. Brilliant Bank is an online-only division of Equity Bank. Brilliant Bank hasn't been rated by the BBB yet, but Equity Bank has received aB- gradefrom the BBB because it has failed to respond to a few customer complaints. CFG Bank currentlydoesn't have a ratingbecause its profile is being updated on the BBB website. A strong BBB rating does not guarantee that you'll have a smooth relationship with a company, though. You still may want to ask friends and family about their experiences to see if a bank is right for you. A money market account is atype of savings accountthat you can find at many financial institutions. Features can vary by bank, but usually, these accounts offer a tiered interest rate and let you access your account through check-writing privileges or a debit or ATM card. Money market accounts let you grow your savings securely andearn interest. The amount of interest you'll earn on a money market account is shown through the annual percentage yield (APY). APY is a percentage, and it tells you how much you'll earn over the course of a year. Government agencies like the FDIC or NCUA protect certain money in bank accounts so that even if there's a bank failure, your money will be protected. Up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category is safe in a money market account. This means if you open a money market account by yourself, up to $250,000 is insured. Meanwhile, if you open a joint bank account with someone else, up to $500,000 can be insured in an account. These accounts also often offer more accessibility than traditional savings accounts or CDs — many banks offer a debit card or paper checks along with the account. If your money market comes with a debit card or ATM card, make sure you know how big its ATM network is and what fees it charges for out-of-network ATM usage. According to the FDIC, theaverage money market accountpays 0.64% APY. However, the best online banks offer money market accounts with significantly higher interest rates. Some banks will require you to meet certain criteria to earn interest. You might also see a money market account with tiered interest rates, which means the rate you earn depends on the amount of money you keep in the account. To maximize your interest earnings, carefully review the bank's interest requirements to ensure you qualify for the highest rate. Also, the compounding frequency for your money market account can affect your total interest earnings if you maintain a high balance. Banks may pay compound interest daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. APY includes compounding frequency. A strong money market account won't have any monthly service fees,overdraft fees, or out-of-network ATM fees. Some banks will also reimburse you if you're charged by an out-of-network provider. Banks specifycommon bank feesassociated with a money market account in a fee schedule. You can find this information online, or you can call customer service to request fee information. Money market accounts areFDIC-insured at banks or NCUA-insured at credit unions. In the event of a bank failure, these government agencies will ensure that up to $250,000 per depositor, per account ownership category, is secure. If you have more than $250,000 in a money market account, you'll get a Receiver's Certificate from the government agency. This document says you can claim funds once the bank's assets are liquidated. It isn't guaranteed that you'll get uninsured deposits back, though. While our guide highlights the top money market accounts with the highest interest rates, that isn't the only factor you should consider when choosing an account. Ideally, you want a low-fee money market account so bank fees don't reduce your interest earnings. Review the account's minimum opening deposit, monthly service fees, and interest rate requirements to determine whether a money market account is the best choice for you. Selecting the right bank can also make a big difference in your overall banking experience. For example, if traditional banking hours don't work for your schedule, then perhaps you'll want abank with 24/7 customer support. Or, if you want to open other bank accounts, you'll likely value a bank with a variety of account types in lieu of one that has limited services. Similar to other types of savings accounts, money market account rates can shift when theFederal Reservechanges the federal funds rate. Money market account rates tend to go up when the Fed raises the federal funds rate, and rates decline if the Fed starts making cuts. It's helpful to keep track ofFed meetingsso you know when the Federal Reserve may potentially implement changes. There are eight meetings scheduled per year, with the potential for more if needed. In September, the Fed cut the federal funds rate for the first time in 2024. In November and December, the Fed cut its rates again. Money market account rates have declined since they peaked earlier in the year, and rates declined further after the decisions. While money market account interest rates are often impacted by changes in economic conditions, banks also have their own criteria for changing rates. You can open a money market account online, at a branch, or by phone. Several of our top picks are online-only banks andcredit unions. If you choose an online-only financial institution, be aware that you won't have access to any physical locations, so you'll have to set up and manage your account solely online. When you're opening up a money market account, you typically need to have your Social Security number and U.S. ID to fill out the application. That said, thetop banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizensallow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular, too. Several of our top picks have a tiered interest rate, so you'll need to meet certain requirements to maximize your savings and get the highest APY. You might need to maintain a certain account balance, set up automatic transfers, or make a specific number of debit card purchases. If you don't think you can regularly meet those requirements, you might prefer a money market account that's more straightforward. Some money market accounts pay the same interest rate regardless of how much money you keep or what you do on the account. If you have a negative financial history, also know that you still have banking options available. You can look forsecond chance bank accounts, which are bank accounts that build your banking history. Like all bank accounts, you'll need to report the interest you earn from your money market account when you file your taxes. Interest is considered a form of income, so you'll need to pay both federal taxes and state taxes on it, depending on where you live and how much interest you make. You can use Form 1099-INT when filling out your tax return to let the IRS know what interest you earned. While bank accounts like money market accounts are one of the safest ways you can make money on your savings, they aren't entirely without risk. The biggest risk is that your financial institution might fail or somehow not be able to get you your money, but there are some protections in place to help mitigate that risk. Most banks are FDIC-insured, while most credit unions areNCUA-insured. Fintechs can't be insured by the federal government, but they generally partner with banks to provide FDIC insurance anyway. Both of these types of insurance work the same: your money is insured in your bank account up to $250,000 per depositor. That being said, money market accounts are more likely than other bank accounts to require you to keep that much money or more in your account to earn the highest rate. Some of these accounts offer enhanced FDIC insurance by spreading your money across several banks, but not every financial institution does this. If you choose to keep more money than federal insurance covers in your account, keep in mind that you could be opening yourself up to risk if your institution fails. Money market accounts are variable-rate accounts, which means that your bank can choose to change your interest rate at any time. This means there's some risk that your bank will lower your interest rate after you've opened an account. You're always free to move your money to another account, but doing that every time there's a rate change can be tiring. If you'd prefer a fixed interest rate, certificates of deposit ensure your rate will stay the same for the CD's term length. For example, if you open a1-year CD, your interest rate will not change for one year. If your money market account has a low interest rate, the interest rate you're earning on your money might be outpaced by theinflationrate, which means your money could actually lose value over time. Right now, you can get a money market account with an interest rate at or near 5%, while the general inflation rate is between 2% and 3%. If possible, you'll want to get a money market account that's well over the inflation rate to make sure you're not losing money. While money market accounts are generally easier to withdraw money from than savings accounts, there are still some limits to your liquidity. Many money market accounts charge excess withdrawal fees if you withdraw money more than six times per month. If you think you'll need to regularly make more withdrawals than that, you might prefer achecking account. Pros of a Money Market Account Cons of a Money Market Account Thebest high-yield savings accountspay similar rates to the top money market accounts. The two accounts also share a similar purpose, so figuring out the best fit for you could come down to small preferences in features. High-yield savings accounts often have lower minimum opening deposits than money market accounts. If you do not have that much money to deposit upfront, high-yield savings accounts might be the way to go. However, if you want more account accessibility, money market accounts will be a lot more appealing to you than high-yield savings accounts. High-yield savings accounts do not give out paper checks, and rarely do they offer an ATM or debit card. Deciding between a money market account and ahigh-yield checking accountwill depend on how you plan to use your account. If you usually maintain a high account balance for expenses, a high-yield checking account is a great account option. However, you're better off with a money market account if you want to establish an emergency fund or save for your financial goals. Money market accounts and CDs are both great places to grow your savings. These accounts are managed very differently, though. Money market accounts are more accessible. You can deposit or withdraw money at any time. CDs only let you deposit money when you first open the account. You'll have to maintain all your money a CD until it reaches maturity or you'll face anearly withdrawal penalty. Interest earnings can also impact your decision. Thebest CD ratesare slightly higher than money market account rates. CDs also have a fixed interest rate, which means the rate stays the same until maturity. Money market accounts have a variable interest rate, so it can change at any time. Due to these differences, you might lean more toward a CD if you can set your money aside for a while in order to earn a fixed interest rate. If you need to add or take out money frequently and don't mind rate fluctuations, choose a money market account. Money market accounts are often confused with money market funds, but it should be noted that they are very different accounts.  A money market account is a type of bank account. Its protected by federal insurance in the event of a bank failure. A money market mutual fund is an investment option, and it isn't federally insured by the FDIC. There's the potential to earn more with a money market fund, but that's also because you're taking some risk — although money market funds are generally considered a low-risk investment, you could still potentially lose money in a money market fund. Meanwhile, money market accounts are protected for up to $250,000 per depositor at banks by the FDIC and at credit unions by the NCUA. You also have a better idea of what your annual rate of return will be with money market accounts than with money market funds, although neither offers a fixed interest rate. Money market accounts could be a good choice for money you don't want to lose, such as emergency funds or short-term savings goals. Money marketmutual fundsare a better choice for long-term savings goals or for money you're not afraid to lose. The nationalaverage bank account interest rateon money market accounts is 0.64% according to the FDIC. Online banks usually offer a higher interest rate on money market accounts, though. The money market account with the highest interest rate right now is theQuontic Money Market Account, which pays 4.75% APY. Keep in mind rates fluctuate along with the federal funds rate, so banks that offer the highest APY now might not down the road, and ones with lower rates now could hike their rates later. To choose the best money market account for your needs, review several banks before settling on a money market account. You can compare fees, interest rates, and the overall banking experience at each financial institution until you find the right place for your money. Interest rates on money market accounts closely follow thefederal funds rate. That is to say, rates are variable and can change multiple times per year based on the Federal Reserve's decisions. The Fed cut interest ratesin September, November, and December in 2024. Money market account rates dropped in response. Another rate drop could happen in 2025, which could also impact money market account rates and stir further rate declines. To learn more about what makes a good money market account and how to choose the best fit, four experts weighed in: We're focusing on what will make a money market account most useful, including APY, access to your money, and more. Here's what they had to say about money market accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What makes a money market account good or not good? Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,Business Insider: \"A good money market account generally provides several ways to access your money, like a debit card, ATM card, or paper checks.\" Roger Ma, CFP® professional and author of\"Work Your Money, Not Your Life\": \"I don't really recommend a money market account for parking your money. I don't know if their fees are really that competitive versus high-yield savings accounts. For most people, I think what makes sense is a high-yield savings account for youremergency fundand any short-term goals.\" How should someone decide whether to put their money in a money market account or another interest-earning account? Tania Brown, CFP® professional and vice president of coaching strategy atOfColor: \"So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.\" Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: \"How soon do you need the money? What kind of access do you need to it? And if you want your money to grow and you want to keep temptation away, then I would put it in a CD.\" Sophia Acevedo, Business Insider: \"I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving themonthly maintenance feeand whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I'm searching for an interest-earning bank account, I'll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account.\" At Business Insider, we aim to help smart people make the best decisions with their money. We understand that \"best\" is often subjective, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a financial product or account — a high APY, for example — we outline the limitations, too. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of various products so you don't have to. Our personal finance team is editorially independent, which means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about. Oureditorial standards pagehas more information about how we review and choose products. There area lotof money market accounts out there. Through our research, we've found that the best money market accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence and mobile access. We reviewed money market accounts using ourbank account methodologyat nearly two dozen institutions to identify the strongest options. While interest rates are an important aspect of any money market account, we also considered minimum deposits and balance requirements, overdraft, and excess transaction fees, the ability to access funds, and any other standout features. We score these features on a scale of zero to five and figure out the weighted average to get an account's total rating. The highest total rating a money market account can get is five stars, while the lowest rating is one star.

The information for the following product(s) has been collected independently by Business Insider: Chase Freedom Flex®. The details for these products have not been reviewed or provided by the issuer.  I've been hearing about the Discover it Cash Back for years, and finally applied for one this summer. This card is one of Business Insider's picks for ourbest credit cardsguide because it earns 5% cash back on different purchases that change every three months (from January 1 to March 31, 2025, earn 5% cash back at restaurants, home improvement stores, and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). I chose thisno-annual-fee credit cardfor two specific reasons: New cardholders get 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers (then 18.24% - 27.24% Variable APR), and double their cash-back at the end of their first year. Earn 5% cash back on everyday purchases at different places you shop each quarter like grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, and more, up to the quarterly maximum when you activate. Earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases automatically. $0 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers 18.24% - 27.24% Variable APR Earn Unlimited Cashback Match™ Good to Excellent The Discover it® Cash Back is one of the best credit cards that offers 5% back on popular rotating categories up to a spending limit. Your rewards are matched by Discover after the first 12 months, and the card has no annual fee. I got this credit card because I wanted cash back and 0% intro APR. But my favorite aspects of the Discover it Cash Back have been a pleasant surprise for me. Discover instantly approved me for the Discover it Cash Back, and immediately offered me access to my new credit card number while I waited for the physical product to appear in the mail. This perk is a \"nice to have\" in most cases, but can be a \"need to have\" if you need to make a large or unexpected transaction on short notice. I didn'tneed-need it this time, but did use my new card to pay for dinner via Apple Wallet mere minutes after I was approved. I have dozens of credit cards and bank accounts, so I've become something of a financial website and app connoisseur. The Discover website and consumer app are pleasantly intuitive and user-friendly, a feature I deeply appreciate from my credit card issuers. Both portals are sleek and contemporary, a feature my fellow Millennial or Gen Z consumers will appreciate. In fact, Discover's layout might be my new favorite amongst bank apps. I've become a big fan of Face ID for phone log-ins, and I was able to quickly set up and use this feature on the Discover app. I also like the single-page overview format, which allows me to scroll for the information I want instead of blindly clicking through multiple tabs. The landing page shows me at a glance how much of a balance I'm carrying, and how much of my credit limit is still available for use. I can also see how much cash back I've already earned — a feature that's much less prominent from Chase or Amex. For more granular detail, the payments, rewards, and services tab quickly show me most of the other information I need including contact information for Discover customer support. I like getting a good deal when I shop, and I don't mind expending a little extra brainpower at checkout. I wanted to get the Discover it Cash Back because it earn 5% back on bonus categories that change every few months (from January 1 to March 31, 2025, earn 5% cash back at restaurants, home improvement stores, and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). I track these rotations using theDiscover cash back calendar, which announces new promotion categories a few weeks before the next quarter begins. I don't earn 5x until I enroll in the promotion, so I make sure to register my card at the beginning of each quarter so the benefit is active on my account. I can earn 5% on the first $1,500 I spend across all bonus categories that quarter — a potential reward of $75 if I max out the full amount. I also have aChase Freedom Flex®in my wallet that also earns 5% cash back onquarterly bonus categories. Doubling up on both no-annual-fee credit cards allows me to save a lot of money on common expenses such as gas, groceries, Amazon, or Paypal transactions. The Chase Freedom Flex also caps rewards at $1,500 per quarter — another $75 potential cash back. Most credit cards offer a welcome bonus when you first sign up. These offers, also known as sign-up bonuses, typically give new cardholders a certain amount of money or points after they spend a designated sum of cash on the card within a specific number of days. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card offers newcomers the chance to earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. In contrast, the Discover it Cash Back doesn't offer a traditional welcome bonus that follows this format. Instead, Discover'sCashback Match™ programmatches all of the cash back I earn throughout my first 12 months of card ownership, whether I earn it from 5% cash-back categories or from 1% cash back on all other purchases. Since I primarily plan to use my Discover it Cash Back on bonus-category purchases each quarter, I could theoretically earn a grand total of $600 during my first year — a generous return from ano-annual-fee credit card. Here's how the math works out: 5% on up to $1,500 per quarter = $75 $75 x 4 quarters = $300 $300 x Cashback Match™ = $600 Pro Tip:The Discover it Cash Back doesn't charge foreign transaction fees — and neither do any other Discover cards. I have plenty of Visa and Amex credit cards, and I've even added a couple of Mastercards in the last year or two. But until I got my own Discover it Cash Back this summer, I hadn't had — or even seen — a Discover card since the early 1990s when I used to poke through my mother's wallet. For many years, I assumed this was because Discover cards aren't as widely accepted as Visa, Amex, or Mastercards. While they are still less popular in many international countries, I discovered you can now use Discover cards in most places throughout the U.S. that accept credit cards. They're also accepted in Canada, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and China. I probably won't take this card overseas with me because of those geographical limitations. But it's nice to know that I won't pay foreign transaction fees if I do need to use it in a pinch. Most credit cards have a standard design, while some statement products like the American Express® Gold Card or the The Platinum Card® from American Express offer a couple of different looks. In contrast, the Discover it Cash Back offers more than two dozen designs for cardholders to choose from — a fun surprise for me to discover during the card application process. I'd never choose a credit card based on aesthetics alone, but I'll take a rainbow card any time I'm given the option. Personal finance experts stress the importance of paying off credit card balances in full each month, with one exception: If you have access to a 0% interest period on your credit card, it may make sense to charge a large transaction to that card and pay off what you owe over the 0% APR period. This is one of my favorite ways to make big expenses a little more palatable. Property taxes run high where I live: I pay 2.2% of my appraised home value yearly. To soften the blow, I occasionally charge the full transaction to a zero-interest credit card, then pay off what I owe over the duration of my 0% APR period. This allows me to invest my money in ahigh-yield savings accountfor a few months. Paying my taxes on a new credit card also helps me hit the spending requirement necessary for a welcome bonus. The Discover it Cash Back comes with a generous 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers (then 18.24% - 27.24% Variable APR). This is one of the longest zero-interest periods offered on a credit card with above-average rewards, especially without an annual fee. I plan to redeem my Discover it Cash Back rewards as a statement credit each month to lower my outstanding balance. I have plenty oftravel rewards credit cardsthat earntransferrable credit card rewards, so a refreshing change to use my Discover rewards purely for cash back. While I don't plan to do so, you can also deposit the cash directly into your bank account or redeem your rewards whenchecking out at Amazon. In any of these cases, the minimum redemption amount is 1 cent. Another option is to donate your rewards to select charities at a minimum of 1 cent, including the American Cancer Society, the ASPCA, the American Red Cross, Carbonfund.org, Children's Miracle Network, Junior Achievement, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Make-A-Wish, Operation Homefront, and World Wildlife Fund. The Discover it Cash Back also has some useful protection features I haven't needed to use yet: If I misplace my card, I can quickly freeze my card with a single tap on the main Activity page within my Discover app. Discover can also search the web for security breaches involving my Social Security number via the free Discover Identity Alerts tool, and remove my info from information-collecting websites through the Discover Online Privacy Protection program. I have free access to myFICO credit scoreat any time within the Discover app activity page by scrolling down to the Card Benefits section and clicking on my \"FICO Credit Scorecard\". Discover typically offers low fees on credit card andbankingproducts, and there's no exception here. The Discover it Cash Back doesn't have an annual fee orforeign transaction fees, and most other charges are easy to avoid. As with all credit cards, I won't owe any interest if I pay off my statement balance in full by the due date each month. As with most credit cards, the Discover it Cash Back does charge fees for the following activities: The Discover it Cash Back doesn't list any major purchase protections or travel insurance benefits, so I only plan to use this card for groceries, dining, or other bonus-category transactions that don't require a robust return policy. I'll probably stick with one of myChase credit cards with purchase protectionif I need to purchase expensive electronics such as a laptop or a TV, where I might want to take advantage of extended warranty benefits. And if I decide to buy a flight or other travel, I'll stick with one of mybest credit cards with travel insurancesuch as theCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Cardor theChase Sapphire Reserve®. The Discover it® Cash Back card is a good choice for those with credit scores in the good to excellent range — a FICO score of at least 670, or aVantageScoreof at least 700.If you're not quite there yet, there are other Discover cards you may qualify for. TheDiscover it® Secured Credit Cardis designed for people who are arenew to creditor rebuilding credit. And theDiscover it® Student Cash Backis anexcellent option for college studentswho don't have a long credit history. When you open an eligible new Discover card, theDiscover Cashback Match™ programwill match all the rewards you earned after the first 12 months with no caps, including your bonus category rewards. For instance, if I earn $400 in rewards within my first year of having the Discover it® Cash Back, Discover will match that for a total of $800 back after my first 12 months. The Discover it® Cash Back caps 5% bonuses at a maximum of $1,500 spent across all bonus categories each quarter (or $75 cash back total). All other transactions earn unlimited 1% cash back per dollar spent, including on bonus categories after the $1,500 threshold has been met. The Discover it® Cash Back is a great card if you prefer earning cash back instead of travel points and don't want to pay an annual fee. It can also be a good pick if the quarterly bonus categories match up with your spending. People who want extra benefits such as annual travel credits should consider other credit cards with better rewards. Every quarter, the Discover it® Cash Back offers new bonus categories that earn 5% cash back per dollar spent. These categories typically cover common expenses such as gas, groceries, Amazon, Paypal, or Target purchases. You must activate the promotion via your online account dashboard or the Discover app before you qualify for the 5x bonus. Rewards are capped at 5% of $1,500 spent across all bonus categories each quarter. After that, your earning rate drops back down to 1% per dollar spent.  When evaluating the Discover it® Cash Back, I considered the card's annual fee, welcome bonus, rewards, benefits, and how well it stacks up to similar credit cards like theChase Freedom Flex®.

A good home insurance company can reduce a family disaster to a small bump in the road. It could be as simple as a curling iron that was not unplugged or as big as a hurricane. No matter the cause, the destruction of your home and belongings doesn't have to be so stressful. Highly rated by JD Power and available in 48 states and Washington, DC. 849 A+ Amica homeowners insurance ranks high with JD Power, operating in 48 states and Washington, DC.

State Farm offers coverage for most homes. Offers multi-policy discounts. A++ GEICO homeowners insurance is one of many products the online giant offers. But, unlike its auto insurance, it encourages customers to work with its call center agents to find the right fit, buy all necessary coverage, etc. Offers many coverage riders to enhance your homeowners coverage and many discounts. 815 A+ Allstate offers many of the most important personal insurance products, including homeowners insurance. It leads the market in discounts, but its base rates may not be as competitive as State Farm and other big competitors. Whatever the situation, quality home insurance coverage could be the difference between full recovery and financial ruin after a home-based incident. A strong home insurance company will assess the damage and pay your claim quickly. Policies are clear, and many insurance companies will deploy agents to hold your hand and help you every step of the way. Amica homeowners insurance tops the charts with industry resources like J.D. Power. In business since 1907, Amica Mutual offers standard and platinum policy options. Some policies offer dividend payments of up to 20% of annual premiums for qualified individuals in participating states. The company also has some of the most affordable homeowners insurance rates. While satisfaction and performance are high, it does not offer coverage in Alaska or Hawai'i. Amica was ranked first in the 2021 and 2022 J.D. Power home insurance studies. Read ourAmica homeowners insurance review. USAA homeowners insurance plans are exclusively available to military members and their immediate family members. But like its other products,USAA USAA Homeowners Insurancemaintains a tight grip on the homeowners insurance market for that select population. Its plans offer both the cheapest home insurance and the best coverage available to US military members. When combined with car insurance, bank accounts, and other products, insured parties may qualify for even lower prices. Read ourUSAA homeowners insurance review. State Farm homeowners insurance remains one of the most recognizable names in insurance, particularly in homeowners andaffordable car insurance. The company works exclusively with captive agents (i.e., agents can only quote and sell State Farm or State Farm partner products). So if you don't like your quote, want to compare home insurance quotes, or don't qualify for coverage, you'll have to talk to at least one more insurance agent. But its agents can get you the most competitive quotes with all applicable discounts for State Farm products. State Farm agents can quote and bind policies for most single-family residences, condos, etc. However, you may run into trouble for multi-units with more than four legal units or in high-risk (but insurable) areas such as higher lava zones or areas affected by wildfires. Read ourState Farm homeowners insurance review. GEICO home insurance is often bundled with GEICO auto insurance. For homeowners working with a mortgage lender, GEICO has a separate department to assist in binding and finalizing the details of your home insurance. Particularly for small homes and condo insurance, GEICO offers cutthroat pricing. Compared to many other discount home insurance companies, GEICO also offers friendly service, easy underwriting approval, and quick claims processing. In the event of a claim, the payout may not be what you'd expect from companies like State Farm, Allstate, or Amica Mutual. Depending on where you live, you may also have to call its toll-free line to get home insurance quotes. Read ourGEICO homeowners insurance review. Allstate homeowners insurance is known for the character \"Mayhem.\" Mayhem, played by actor Dean Winters, plays out real claims scenarios Allstate has paid in entertaining commercials. Allstate offers a range of home insurance products including plans for investors to cover the structure and liability associated with having tenants. Renters should supplement withrenters coverage, but Allstate plans are highly customizable. Like State Farm, Allstate is only quoted through the company's captive agents, and they do not insure structures with more than four units. Read ourAllstate homeowners insurance review. While uncommon, some homes are uninsurable. This would include homes in certain fire zones and lava zones. Beachfront properties (depending on the distance to the ocean) can be insured, but only with higher premiums for lower coverage limits. Not all insurers offer coverage for high-risk areas. The exact rules vary between policies. This is why it's critical to work with an insurance agent you trust and review your policy documents. An all perils home insurance policy will cover damage caused by anything that's not specifically excluded in the policy documents. With decades of claims and underwriting experience, insurers list exclusions from lava and hurricanes to riots, war, nuclear hazards, and government action. So read carefully before assuming specific incidents will be covered under your home insurance. If you choose a named-perils policy, you may get the cheapest home insurance rates available to you. As you might expect, insurers only cover damage associated with perils listed in the policy documents. So the risk of unpaid claims is higher. In short, if your named perils policy covers damage from fires, lightning, and explosions, you would not be covered if a car crashed into your home unless it caused an explosion. Similarly, you decide what property coverage you want up front. Dwelling coverage (the cost to repair or replace your home if destroyed) is a constant, particularly if you have a mortgage. Many other coverages are optional. Homeowners who want thecheapest home insurance rateswhen shopping for homeowners insurance might skip personal property coverage. Investors renting properties out might also skip personal property coverage while increasing liability coverage. If a covered peril damages your home, though, you would then be responsible to replace furniture, clothing, electronics, and any other personal property. The exact breakdown of coverage varies between home insurance companies. No matter where you buy, there are two exclusions with no exceptions. Mortgage lendersrequire borrowers to buy a homeowners policy covering the cost to rebuild your home. This estimate is based on the appraisal or your insurance agent's estimated replacement cost matrix. Some homeowners are also required to pay for regional coverage such as flood, hurricane, or earthquake. Unless you specify otherwise, the lender will then collect a small amount each month to pay your premium for you once a year. Keep in mind, all insurance notices will be sent to you automatically. So if prices go up or you want to switch for any reason, you have control over your homeowners insurance. Important note:Your insurance company will still send you notices when payments are due, if payment is missed, etc. DO NOT ignore these as your mortgage company can buy its own (much more expensive) policy if yours lapses. The cheapest home insurance is not always the most affordable. Homeowners insurance quotes give buyers a preview of what they may pay each year. But this doesn't account for the cost of claims or how much you could pay out of pocket if your claims are denied or your insurer drags out the process. When shopping for home insurance, we balance cost with performance and coverage. The Better Business Bureau accepts a company's customer complaints and reviews advertising and transparency about business practices. Once a complaint is submitted, companies can respond and resolve the issues. The BBB ranking does not guarantee great rates or that you'll love the company. That's why we also looked at average rates, reviews from sites like TrustPilot, and sample plans to compare coverage options. However, a company with a high BBB rating is more likely to stay above board and address consumer issues. USAA's limited availability makes it impractical for organizations like JD Power or the BBB to rank it alongside companies that sell to a more diverse range of users. However, many of our top home insurance picks maintain the BBB's highest ranking. When combined with strong JD Power, AM Best rankings, reviews from real homeowners, and advice from our expert panel, we feel confident saying our top picks are also trustworthy home insurance companies for the average consumer. Yes, most people have homeowners insurance. If you have a mortgage, your lender will require home insurance. In most cases, your homeowners insurance invoices will be sent to your lender, and it will add costs to your monthly payments. Among homeowners who own their home outright, most still have insurance to protect against the unexpected. An umbrella policy offers a boost in coverage for multiple policies with one premium. If you're bundling your homeowners and auto insurance policies with one company, raising your liability limits on each policy could be costly. Whether you're in an auto accident or your dog bites the mailman, the ensuing claim can be costly, especially if you don't have sufficient liability coverage. A home insurance policy for a condo could be as little as $200 annually depending on coverage. A homeowners policy for a single-family detached structure on a beachfront could be $5,000 or more annually. With so many factors to consider, a licensed insurance agent is the best resource for customized plans to meet individual needs. At a minimum, homeowners need replacement coverage for the structure. In short, your insurance company runs a cost assessment to estimate the construction cost for replacing your home if it were completely destroyed. More importantly, check your coverage exclusions, add-ons like water backup coverage, and personal property coverage limits. Even if you have limited personal belongings, furnishing a house could quickly reach $100,000 or more. We spoke to a variety of experts to inform our picks for this best home insurance guide, and to give readers additional advice for finding the right policy. You can read what they had to say later in this guide, under the Experts' Advice section. We worked with a realtor, homeowners insurance agent, and mortgage loan originator to discuss what buyers should consider when buying home insurance. You can find their full commentary below. Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Homeowners should take into account both coverage and price. Critical riders like water backup coverage cost you as little as a few dollars per renewal period while saving you thousands in the event of a claim. When calculating your monthly mortgage costs, the right homeowners insurance ensures your home also fits your budget. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller WilliamsHawaii Dream Homes Homeowners should have complete coverage without too many stipulations or exceptions. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent withIFG Insurance LLC Details of the policy are important. Ex:Replacement Cost vs Actual Cash Value coverage/endorsement like water backup coverage. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC I believe is most important to look for when buying homeowners insurance is making sure that your coverage is truly comprehensive. A named peril policy provides coverage ONLY for the select types of damages listed in the specific policy. On the other hand, a comprehensive peril policy makes getting insurance to cover any incident much easier. Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Consider how much you can afford to spend in the event of a claim? If you cannot afford to spend $1,000 out of pocket to deal with a major flood, for example, a $1,000 deductible may lower your monthly premium, but it's too high. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller Williams Hawaii Dream Homes Your deductible should match your income and available cash on hand. Having a larger deductible will save you money, but if you can't afford to pay a large deductible when you need the insurance, then the extra savings don't matter. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent with IFG Insurance LLC Your deductible should be based on claim history & affordability. If you have no claims history and are not likely to file claim, you can raise your deductible. But understand that the deductible will be the out-of-pocket amount if any claim are filed. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC Low deductible plans require higher monthly premiums but lower out of pocket expenses. High deductible plans provide lower monthly premiums but higher expenses in the event of an insurance claim. You should choose a deductible that balances out your monthly and out-of-pocket costs in the event of a claim. Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Many homeowners underestimate the importance of riders. All they see is extra costs. The bulk of your monthly premiums is spent on dwelling coverage, personal property, and other key parts of homeowners coverage. The devil is in the details, especially when it comes to homeowners insurance riders. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller Williams Hawaii Dream Homes Not getting enough coverage for a complete rebuild, not checking for specific coverage like flood or hurricane, and not looking at the conditions of the insurance. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent with IFG Insurance LLC Most buyers will choose the cheapest insurance, which might leads to homeowners being underinsured. Getting insurance with not enough coverage is like driving a car with a drawing of a seatbelt on your shirt. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC Equipment breakdown coverage is something that I see buyers missing when buying homeowners insurance. This is an easy & affordable rider. Common examples of covered equipment being air conditioning systems, furnaces, heat pumps, heaters, and kitchen & laundry appliances. Sites like J.D Power, user review sites, and other sources play a role in our reviews, as do policy documents. While we cannot look at every policyholder's documents, most home insurance companies have specific coverage limits and benefits applicable to all standard policies. To come up with our list of the best home insurance companies, we also considered common exclusions and the impact on the average homeowner compared to average premiums. We take into account customer experience and the claims experience. While homeowners hope to never experience a partial or full loss of their home, most do. Finally, we factor in financial stability. Regardless of size, insurance companies walk a tight line between premiums coming in and claims payments going out. We look for insurers likely to be around for the foreseeable future.

We assess the ethics of each company, so you can see if a specific financial institution aligns with your values. We include the settlement history of the last three years so you're aware of any recent public controversies involving the bank. The Better Business Bureau assigns companies grades, ranging from F to A+. A strong BBB score indicates a company responds effectively to customer complaints, advertises honestly, and is transparent about business practices. Here are the BBB grades for our top picks: Chime's B- ratingis due to government action taken against hte company and a high volume of customer complaints on the BBB website. Security Service Federal Credit Union has aB ratingfrom the BBB because it has not resolved a few customer complaints. A strong BBB grade doesn't guarantee you'll have a smooth relationship with a company, though. Discover Bank has had one recent lawsuit, too. In 2024,Discover settled a class action lawsuitfrom DACA recipients. The lawsuit said that Discover unlawfully denied DACA recipients loans because of their immigration status. Discover will pay $979,500 as part of the settlement. Discover does not admit wrongdoing by settling, and it maintains that it complied with the law. Chime used the URL \"Chimebank.com\" and the words \"bank\" and \"banking,\" but Chime isn't licensed as a bank. Chime is a banking platform, and is insured by a bank. In 2021, the Commissioner of Financial Protection and InnovationorderedChime to stop using the terms \"Chimebank.com,\" \"bank,\" and \"banking\" on its webpage and advertisements. In January 2025,the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued Capital One. The CFPB says that Capital One unlawfully misled customers about what the best interest rate was on Capital One savings accounts, leading to consumers missing out on more than $2 billion in interest payments. Capital One had an account called 360 Savings. In 2019, Capital One created the new 360 Performance Savings Account, which paid a much higher interest rate. Many customers thought their old savings accounts would transition into this new one, but in reality, they had to open a new 360 Performance Savings Account to earn the higher rate. If you want to knowhow to open a checking account, here are a few steps to follow: Online checking accounts are managed primarily through online and mobile banking. In comparison, traditional checking accounts are available at brick-and-mortar banks. You can visit local branches to conduct everyday transactions and speak to a banker. Most of our top picks are online checking accounts because they charge minimal bank fees. Traditional checking accounts often have minimum balance requirements to waive a monthly service fee or earn interest. There are other online checking account benefits that make these accounts strong options overall, including high interest rates and cash-back perks. There are five types of checking accounts: regular checking accounts, high-interest checking accounts, cash-back checking accounts, and specialty checking accounts. Here's an overview of each type of checking account: The best checking account for you may hinge on your banking preferences and goals. For example, if you regularly maintain a high checking account balance, the best high-yield checking accounts may be appealing options. The best checking accounts are no-fee checking account options. They have minimal bank fees, like monthly service,overdraft fees, and out-of-network ATMs. The most suitable option for you might also depend on whether you're looking for special perks, like a cash bonus, interest, or cash-back rewards. Yes, many financial institutions allow you to open a checking account online. You'll still need to provide basic information to open your bank account, like your full name and address. Most financial institutions also require you to provide a Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number. ATM networks may be important when choosing a checking account if you frequently need access to cash. Generally, local financial institutions have the smallest ATM networks, followed by regional banks. National banks usually offer their own ATM network or are partnered with a national network like Allpoint. Yes, many banks have interest-earning checking accounts. You might need to maintain a certain account balance or make frequent debit card transactions to earn interest. If you're unhappy with your current checking account, compare other banks and see if another is more suitable. Switching banks may be the best option if you aren't satisfied with your overall banking experience. We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best checking accounts for your needs. Here's what they had to say about checking accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What are some good qualities to look for in a checking account? Roger Ma, CFP® professional and author of\"Work Your Money, Not Your Life\": \"I would look at the ATM branch locations and then minimum balance amounts to not incur a monthly fee … I think there's other stuff that could make life easier, whether it's free checks, online bill pay, are they in the Zelle network?\" Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,Business Insider: \"I would look for a checking account that either doesn't have any monthly service fees or offers multiple ways to waive the fee. I would also look at customer support availability and mobile app ratings.\" How can someone find the right bank? Tania Brown, CFP® professional and vice president of coaching strategy atOfColor: \"Obviously, you want to make sure it's FDIC insured. Also, your banking experience — do you like walking into a bank? Well, then you need someone local. Do you just not care if you ever see your bank? Then you're okay online. Do you write checks? Do you not write checks? So it's thinking through how your experience with it is going to be before you make that decision.\" Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: \"The No. 1 thing about a checking account is you should know what provider the debit card is coming from. And a lot of people don't think about that, because there are places that don't accept MasterCard or don't accept Amex.\" At Business Insider, we strive to help smart people make the best decisions with their money. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of 200 checking accounts, so you don't have to. Business Insider's personal finance team is editorially independent, which means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about. Read more about how we rate and review products on oureditorial standards page. We understand that \"best\" is often subjective, however, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a checking account — no fees, for example — we outline the limitations, too. We considered 200 checking account offerings using ourbank account methodologyto determine the strongest options for the best checking accounts. We gave precedence to no-monthly-fee checking accounts or those with the option to waive monthly fees with qualifying activities, overdraft protection options, widespread ATM access and/or reimbursement for ATM fees, and mobile banking capabilities. We rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars. If a checking account has a rating of one star, that's the lowest possible, and it means the bank account requires significant improvement. If a checking account has five stars, that's the highest rating possible, and it's considered a superior option. For checking accounts, we look at minimum opening deposit requirements, monthly service fees, overdraft protection options, ATM network/fees, customer support availability, mobile app ratings, miscellaneous features and overall ethics and security of the company. We score each of these features on a scale of zero to five, then calculate the weighted average to get an account's final rating.

Read more in ourCiti Double Cash card review. Cash-back credit cards can be an easy way to break into the world of credit card rewards. They come in a few different types: If you're willing to juggle multiple credit cards, there's value in having both cash back and points-earning cards. If you prefer a single-card strategy, evaluate your goals and consider how much you're willing to pay in annual fees to make the best decision for your situation. If you're trying to put money back in your wallet, our top recommendations are to transfer your cash back to a bank account or use it to reduce the amount owed on your credit card statement. On the other hand, if you're hoping to earn rewards that you can redeem for travel, a card that earns points is more up your alley. Many of thebest rewards credit cardsearn either Amex Membership Rewards points, Chase Ultimate Rewards points, Citi ThankYou Rewards points, or Capital One miles. You can transfer all of these currencies to travel partners and redeem them for things like free flights. (Note that, while Capital One calls its rewards currency \"miles,\" they aren't miles with a given airline program.) Find out more about what your credit card rewards are worth by reading Business Insider's guide towhat points and miles are worth in value. It won't be worth your while to use a cash back credit card if you end up paying interest or late fees on what you owe. It's important to pay your balance in full each month, make those payments on time, and only spend what you can afford. Cash back cards vary greatly in their return rates: You can earn anywhere from 1% to 6% back depending on the purchase category, card, and issuer. Many cash back cardshave no annual fees, so you don't have to pay for the privilege of earning rewards. If you're new to rewards credit cards and aren't interested in earning travel points or miles, a cash back card is the best choice for you. With cash back cards, 1% back will always be worth 1 cent, no matter what, and you can use your rewards to lower your monthly bill or transfer it to your checking account, among other options. The best cash back credit card for you depends on your spending habits and whether you prefer a flat rate of cash back on all spending, or earning bonus cash back on specific purchase categories and 1% on everything else. Flat-rate cash back cards are best for those who don't want to keep track of multiple bonus categories and just want a simple earning structure. But if you really want to maximize your rewards earning, choosing a card that earns bonus cash back in categories where you spend a lot — like groceries, dining, or gas — can make a huge difference in your rate of return. There are several ways to evaluate cash back credit cards based on factors like rewards value, flexibility, fees, and overall customer experience. To choose the best cash back credit card for you, you'll want to consider a few things: Earning extra cash back for gas isn't much use if you don't drive, while a credit card that earns bonus points on groceries may not be very useful for someone who doesn't cook. Consider how you intend to use this card, and look at the rate for those spending categories. Make sure you're clear on what you're earning. Is it statement credit? Cash? Points? If points, can they be combined with or transferred to other cards you have, or brands you like? An annual fee may make or break your choice. Are you willing to pay an annual fee — and more importantly, can you afford it comfortably, or will the cash back you'll earn in a year exceed the amount you pay? If this all sounds too complicated, you can't go wrong by using the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, which has no annual fee and a flat earning rate of 2% cash rewards on purchases. Cash back credit cards are often best used in combination with cards that earn points to create a complete credit card portfolio that takes advantage of multiple types of rewards. Pro tip:We don't mention a credit card's interest rate, because the APR only applies if you're carrying a balance on your credit card. We recommend applying for a cash back credit card intending to pay off the balance in full each month. For other categories of credit cards, like balance transfer cards, the APR might be a more important consideration. Cash back credit cards have several pros and cons: Pros of cash back credit cards Cash back credit cards earn the simplest form of rewards, where every point you earn is worth a fixed amount (usually 1 cent apiece). But thebest rewards credit cardscan offer much greater returns if you use your points for luxury travel experiences. It all comes down to whether you prefer the simplicity and flexibility of cash back instead of the higher potential (and increased complexity) of points and miles rewards. If you want to have the option of both types of rewards, consider pairing a card like the Chase Freedom Unlimited® with atravel rewards credit cardlike the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. While the Chase Freedom Unlimited® earns cash back, transferring those rewards to the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card allows you to use your rewards for additional value throughChase Travelor viaChase Ultimate Rewards travel transfer partners. If you have a cash back credit card or are considering opening one, you'll want to make the most of it. Keep the following steps in mind to get the most value from your card: Credit card cash back or points aren't useful if you're carrying a balance and paying interest charges each month. To make the most of rewards, use your card responsibly: Spend only the money you have and pay your bill in full each month. Some cash-back cards offer elevated rewards rates on specific spending areas, like restaurants, gas stations, or supermarkets. Some of these cards even change those areas from quarter to quarter, meaning you'll want to stay on top of where your card earns the most and when. Expert tip:If you struggle to keep track of which cards earn how much, consider downloading acredit card rewards-tracking applike CardPointers to help you remember which card to use when checking out. If you use your cash-back card for every purchase, you don't need to be as diligent, but if you're using your card as one of many you'll want to be sure you know how to maximize rewards. It might be tempting to let your cash back pile up just to watch the total tick up, but it's more useful if you redeem it. You can generally apply the cash to your card balance or get it deposited in your checking account, and either one is a fine option. As mentioned above, in some cases, you can transfer cash back to a points-earning card on which your rewards are worth more. This strategy isn't required to make the most of your cash back card, but it can help take rewards to the next level. Chase cards are an example of this: If you hold a cash-back card like the Chase Freedom Flex®and a points-earning card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, you can transfer rewards earned on the Freedom Flex to the Sapphire Preferred, and unlock more redemption options. Cash back credit cards can be slightly easier to get than premium rewards credit cards, which often require anexcellent credit scorefor approval. If you have abad credit score, you may want to consider one of thebest starter credit cardsor one of thebest credit cards for bad credit, since some of the top options still earn rewards and allow you to upgrade to a better credit card after time and responsible use. Cash-back credit cards offer the benefit of earning a percentage of your purchases back in cash, which can be redeemed as statement credits, direct deposits, or checks. They also often come with additional perks such as purchase protection, travel insurance, and no foreign transaction fees. Potential downsides include annual fees for some cards, lower rewards rates compared to other types of rewards cards, and the possibility of high-interest rates if you carry a balance. It's important to understand the card's terms and conditions and use it responsibly. Yes, cash-back credit cards can typically be used for a wide range of purchases, including groceries, dining, travel, and online shopping. However, some cards offer higher cash back rates for specific categories, so it's beneficial to choose a card that aligns with your spending habits. Look for a rewards program that offers high earning rates in categories you frequently spend in, such as groceries, dining, or gas. Also, consider the flexibility of redemption options, any caps on earnings, the card's annual fee, and additional perks or benefits that add value. Cash-back credit cards work by giving you a percentage of every dollar you spend — usually at least 1% — as cash back in your card account. Some cash-back cards earn a higher percentage in bonus categories, such as groceries, dining, or gas. You can transfer the cash back you earn from these cards to a bank account, use it to pay down your credit card statement, or redeem it for gifts and merchandise. Cash-back credit cards do give cash, but that's not to say you'll necessarily see the physical cash. You're typically awarded cash back as a credit that you can use to cancel out purchases from your credit card statement, or to redeem for gift cards or merchandise online. Some cards do let you take your cash as a deposit to your account or as a check. No single credit card offers the most cash back in every category, but a few that stand out for high rewards. The Amex Blue Cash Preferred Card earns 6% back on the first $6,000 you spend each calendar year at U.S. supermarkets (then 1% back), and 6% back on select U.S. streaming services. The most rewarding choice for dining out is the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card with 3% back. A cash back card could be better than a travel or rewards card, depending on what you want to do with your rewards. If you primarily want to put money back in your bank account rather than earn rewards you can redeem for travel, a cash back credit card is ideal — and you usually won't have to pay a very high annual fee, if you have to pay one at all. We evaluated dozens of cash back credit cards and narrowed down our list by considering the following factors: See a full breakdown ofhow we rate credit cardsat Business Insider.

International students often struggle to get credit cards because they lack credit history and may not have a Social Security Number or other sufficient identification to help them get started in the U.S. banking system. As its name suggests, the Firstcard® Credit Builder Card with Cashback for College Students can change that game. Firstcard membership comes with a joint bank account and credit card combo for successful U.S. resident applicants of any nationality. This card is essentially a secured credit card, with funds from the Firstcard bank account used as security against the card balance. Firstcard doesn't initiate a hard credit pull to determine eligibility, and helps cardholders build credit by reporting payment activity to major credit bureaus every month. The most exciting aspect of the Firstcard is that cardholders can earn interest on any funds banked within their account. Members earn 1.25% annual percentage yield (APY) with the base-tier Firstcard membership, and 4.25% APY with Firstcard+, which costs $2.99 per month. Members can also earn up to 15% cash back from 29,000 retailers throughout the U.S., and up to 10% cash back on every purchase. Finally, Firstcard does not charge the usual card fees (unless you sign up for Firstcard+): No account management fees, annual fees, no interest, no late fees, no overdraft fees, no setup fees, and no foreign transaction fees. Our team of experts scoured online forums such as Reddit, Facebook, and FlyerTalk to see what everyday cardholders are saying about their favorite first credit cards for newbies. One online commenter rightly said, \"The best first credit card is the one you can actually get.\" Applying for a credit card and getting rejected won't hurt your finances, but it's easiest to focus on attainable products, then upgrade or add to your wallet as you build credit. Discover is well-known to be especially friendly to first-time credit card applicants, which is why we've included the Discover it® Student Chrome, Discover it® Student Cash Back, and the Discover it® Secured Credit Card in this guide. And if you get theChase Freedom Rise℠and open aChase bankaccount to build your relationship with this major issuer, it will be easier to get approval for popular cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve® down the road. Since theChase Freedom Rise℠automatically upgrades to the Chase Freedom Unlimited® after one year, you'll be able to transfer rewards you earned from your Rise/Unlimited card to the Sapphire card, then use those rewards toward a variety of travel opportunities at a fraction of the cash value. Many cardholders agree that everyone can benefit from bonus rewards on supermarkets and grocery stores. Some recommend theBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express, which earns 6% back on groceries and streaming subscriptions as well as 3% back on gas and transit costs (1% on everything else). However, Amex cards can be harder to acquire for first-time applicants, since American Express often has stringent requirements for credit approval.Instead, beginners can consider the Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards Credit Card, which earns 3% back on restaurants, groceries, streaming services, and entertainment purchases (1% on everything else). Most students, young adults, and individuals new to credit can easily maximize these spending categories, and responsible usage on this card will build good credit over time that will help toward qualifying for premium cards from Amex. When choosing a first credit card, it's important to consider features such as low or 0% intro APR, low or no annual fees, rewards programs, and credit-building tools. These features can help you effectively manage your credit effectively and take advantage of benefits such as purchase protection, travel insurance, and extended warranty. All of the cards we've reviewed here offer perks that enhance your financial security and protect your investments. Students, young adults, and beginners who are un- or underemployed face unique challenges when applying for credit cards because they have less income than many issuers want to see when offering credit. If you're a college student, be sure to read our guide to thebest student credit cardsto learn more. You may also benefit from learning how to boost your credit score by having a parent or guardian add you as anauthorized user on their credit card. Choosing the right beginner credit card for you depends on your credit score and where you're at in your credit journey. If you've never had a credit card before, it's likely you'll have to get started with asecured credit cardthat requires a cash deposit to shore up a small line of credit. If your FICO credit score is at least \"fair,\" or above 580, on the other hand, you may qualify for a card geared to consumers with average credit. If you're just starting out, secured credit cards are the easiest for approval. Almost anyone can get approved for a secured credit card regardless of their credit score, even if they're using thecredit card to rebuild credit. This type of credit card requires an initial cash deposit to secure a line of credit that is typically for the same amount. For example, you may put down a $500 cash deposit to secure a $500 line of credit. Tobuild credit with a credit card, use your credit card for expenses within your budget, then pay off your balance in full each month. Your monthly payments will be reported to the threecredit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion., and, over time, you'll build a history of responsible credit use that will boost your credit score. You can have one credit card or several. It's totally up to you. When you're first building credit, however, it makes sense to limit yourself to a single card. This way, you can spend time building responsible credit habits before you add more cards and complicate your finances. How to improve your credit scorevaries depending on several factors: Whether you have any credit history at all, whether you have negative marks on your credit report, and the way you handle credit in the short term. Your best bet is to use a credit card for regular purchases that you pay in full each month. If you have excellent credit — a FICO score above 740 — you will likely qualify for the best rewards and travel credit cards. Make sure to compare thebest current credit card sign-up bonusesby their rewards and cardholder perks, and see ourbest rewards credit cardsguide for more info. Business Insider chose the best starter credit cards by first considering credit cards that don't require an excellent credit score to be approved. From there, we focused on cards that appeal to those just starting out with credit, including credit cards for students with no credit and secured credit options. We then narrowed down the list by evaluating the card's features, including rewards earning, annual and other fees, simplicity, and benefits. Here's our methodology forhow we rate credit cards.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByAlexander Tin January 27, 2025 / 5:36 PM EST/ CBS News Staff across theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionwere ordered Monday to cut off all communications with the World Health Organization, multiple federal health officials confirmed to CBS News, to comply withPresident Trump's executive orderlast week. Beyond calling for the U.S. to begin the yearlong process to formally withdraw from funding the U.N. health agency, Mr. Trump'sexecutive orderhad also instructed federal agencies to \"recall and reassign\" any U.S. government personnel from working with the WHO. The sweeping directive to implement the order was issued by the CDC's Deputy Director for Global Health John Nkengasong in an email Monday, one official said, pending further guidance for when and how exceptions might be carved out. CDC staff assigned to work for the WHO are also being told not to come into the office, the email said, pending further guidance from leadership. Mr. Trump has long been critical of the WHO, blaming the organization for mishandlingCOVID-19and saying it gets too much money from the U.S., whichdonatesthe most of any country. At aneventin Las Vegas on Jan. 25, he said the WHO had offered to cut the U.S. funding commitment down to around the amount given by China. \"Maybe we would consider doing it again. I don't know. Maybe we would. They have to clean it up a little bit,\" Mr. Trump said. Former health officials tell CBS News they worry the U.S. withdrawal from the WHOcould endanger efforts to respond to diseases, both undermining the U.N. agency and also making it harder for American officials to prepare. The first way U.S. officials would sometimes hear about worrying outbreaks was through the WHO, especially in countries wary of working with American authorities. The WHO also relies on disease experts dispatched by the U.S. and other countries to fill its ranks. \"As has been repeated many times, infectious diseases know no boundaries and in today's world of rapid travel, an outbreak anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" said James LeDuc, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Between working for the U.S. Army's medical research and heading the Galveston National Laboratory, LeDuc worked for CDC as a WHO medical officer and later one of the agency's top-ranking global health officials. \"The fact is that there is no alternative to WHO. WHO has the global mandate that allows health issues to be addressed on a global scale in a coordinated manner,\" LeDuc said. A World Health Organization spokesperson declined to comment on the move. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The gag order comes ahead of a key committee meeting next month, where CDC officials were scheduled to help the WHO pick out strains for next winter's influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccine manufacturers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rely on the data and findings by that panel to decide on the shots used every fall around the Northern Hemisphere. The CDC also plays a key role as a WHO \"collaborating center\" for flu, serving as one of the world's one of the world's top laboratories for testing and studying the virus. Many countries send samples of worrying influenza cases to the CDC's Atlanta laboratory for scrutiny of mutations that might pose a pandemic threat, like after deaths from bird flu or swine flu. CDC staff assigned to work for the WHO often serve as liaisons with the agency's disease experts, offering insights into worrying new germs the WHO is responding to around the world. Others work with other countries tostomp outlingering diseases, like theGlobal Polio Eradication Initiativebacked by both agencies. The WHO also plays a key role in issuing licenses and coordinating trials that allow for the use of medicines to respond to diseases, especially for smaller countries facing outbreaks of new diseases. Multiple former federal health officials said the WHO also played a key role in facilitating the response and rollout ofa U.S. vaccineto respond to an outbreak ofMarburg, an Ebola-like disease, in Rwandalast year. Authorities are closely watching another outbreak of Marburg this year in Tanzania, which the WHO announced confirming last week. \"The expertise provided by CDC and other U.S. government agencies is absolutely essential to the success of WHO activities and to the well-being of the United States,\" said LeDuc. LeDuc recalled that U.S. staff were once proud to don WHO uniforms, working steps away from scientists from former Cold War adversaries to stem emerging disease threats out of the international organization's Geneva office. \"I don't think we want, particularly as public health experts, to feel like they can only wave the U.S. flag in those positions. The reason why it worked is because we were able to be American and also to be global citizens,\" said Loyce Pace, director of global affairs for HHS under the Biden administration. Pace said there are hundreds of American health agency officials who work with the WHO. She said it is likely other countries will likely try to step to fill the void left by American public health officials. Another former federal official said China has been seeking to fill more posts within the U.N. agency, worrying some U.S. officials about how they may seek to use their positions. \"My hope is that there's a part of us that will continue to work to see that not as a weakness but as a strength, to distinguish us from other actors who don't have that approach and, frankly, have not been as effective in building partnerships to protect the world,\" said Pace.

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Watch CBS News ByCamilo Montoya-Galvez Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 8:22 PM EST/ CBS News Washington— The Trump administration's swiftcrackdown on immigrationhas moved beyond those living in or entering the U.S. illegally, with officials also issuing bans and restrictions on legal immigration, including programs for refugees displaced by violence. President Trump made getting tough on illegal immigration a pillar of his presidential campaign, and he has already enacted far-reaching measures targeting those who violated U.S. immigration law. They include sealing the U.S.asylum systemfor those without proper documents;tasking the militarywith deporting immigration violators; andempoweringdeportation officers to target most unauthorized immigrants, including those without criminal records. But, with less fanfare, Mr. Trump's actions have closed pathways for vetting and legally admitting hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war-tornUkraine,Taliban-controlledAfghanistan and other troubled parts of the world, including crisis-strickenHaitiandVenezuela. Hours after taking office, Mr. Trumpindefinitely pausedthe U.S. refugee admissions program, instructing officials to ban the entry of all refugees, a special legal classification for people vetted overseas who prove they are fleeing persecution based on their political beliefs, religion or other factors. Unpublished State Department statistics obtained by CBS News show the move stranded more than 22,000 refugees who had been approved for departure to the U.S. after undergoing a process that, on average, takes between 18 and 24 months due to rounds of interviews, security screenings and medical checks. As part of its suspension of foreign aid, the administration instructed theresettlement agenciesthat integrate refugees into American communities to stop using certain federal funds — a directive advocates believe will prevent them from providing critical services to those refugees already in the U.S. Refuge admissions will only be restarted if Mr. Trump determines that doing so \"is in the interests of the United States,\" according to hisdirective. In that order, he argued refugees were a strain on American communities. The Trump administration has also directed officials to cease allowing immigrants into the U.S. through an immigration policy known as parole, which can be used to grant entry to foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. The Biden administration used that law at an unprecedented scale, including to dissuade migrants from traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border. An internal directive by the acting head of U.S. Citizenship of Immigration Services last week ordered officials to stop granting parole to Ukrainians sponsored by Americans through theUniting for Ukraine policy, which the Biden administration set up to offer a safe haven to those fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roughly 240,000 Ukrainians came to the U.S. under the process, according to unpublished government data. It also instructed officials to refrain from renewing the parole status of Afghans brought to the U.S. following the fall of Kabul in 2021. While many of the more than70,000 Afghanevacuees have gained asylum or special visas for those who aided the American military, the move could prompt some to lose their legal status. The order suspended processing for other parole-based programs, including a sponsorship initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans and an Obama-era policy that allowed some Central American youth to come to the country legally to reunite with relatives. Both policies were designed to be alternatives to trekking to the U.S. southern border. While those paroled into the country are, on paper, in the U.S. legally and with the ability to work lawfully, Trump administration officials have argued the Biden administration improperly used the authority, which they believe should only be used in very limited cases. Just minutes after Mr. Trump was sworn in, his administration shut down a mobile application, known asCBP One, that allowed migrants in Mexico to request a time to enter the U.S. at official border entry points. U.S. border officials were welcoming 1,500 migrants per day under that app during the Biden administration, which touted the process as the right way to seek asylum since crossing between ports of entry is illegal. Last week, Trump officialsauthorizedImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents to revoke the parole status of those allowed into the U.S. under the Biden administration and seek their deportation. That would include more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who flew to the U.S. under the sponsor policy and nearly 1 million migrants allowed into the country through CBP One,government figuresshow. Trump officials moved quickly to cease operations at offices that the Biden administration established infour Latin American countriesto vet and screen migrants for legal immigration programs and discourage them from unlawfully crossing the southern border. Those hubs, known as \"Safe Mobility Offices,\" also vetted migrants for resettlement in Spain and Canada. Mr. Trump's move to upendbirthright citizenship— for now,halted in the courts— would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to immigrants on temporary visas (as well as to those with parents who are in the country illegally). Other restrictions on legal immigration are also expected further into Mr. Trump's term. He alreadytaskedfederal agencies to recommend partial or total immigration bans for countries whose citizens officials determine cannot be properly vetted. Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, a refugee resettlement group, said she appreciated some of the comments Mr. Trump has made in support of legal immigration. But she said she was deeply troubled by his move to halt refugee arrivals. \"Canceling flights for already approved refugees who have waited years as they've gone through extreme vetting betrays promises we made in creating this bipartisan legal program,\" Vignarajah said, calling the refugee process the \"gold standard\" in legal immigration. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for cutting legal immigration, said Mr. Trump is cracking down on immigration programs he believes former President Biden \"unlawfully created or unlawfully abused.\" Krikorian said Biden used the parole authority, for example, as a \"means of essentially freelancing his own parallel immigration system outside the law, so that has to be restricted.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByHaley Ott January 27, 2025 / 12:22 PM EST/ CBS News London —Elon Musk made a surprise videolink appearance at a campaign event for Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on Saturday, during which he told a crowd of around 4,500 AfD supporters that \"children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents,\" in an apparent reference to the Nazi Germany just two days before Holocaust Remembrance Day. The AfD, which Musk hadpreviously voiced his support for, has been labelled a suspected extremist organization by Germany's national security services. \"There is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that,\" Musk said, adding that he considered the anti-immigration, anti-cultural integration party, \"the best hope for Germany.\" \"It's good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything,\" said Musk, who has become aclose allyandadviser to President Trump. He gave the remarks just days after police in Germany said they were investigating the projection of large-scale images of Musk making a gesture reminiscent of the Nazi salute onto a Tesla factory outside Berlin. Musk made the gesture twice at an inauguration event for President Trump at the beginning of last week. A U.K. campaign group and a German satirical group have taken responsibility for the projections. Any display of Nazi symbols is against federal law in Germany. Musk has not directly denied giving a Nazi salute, but he mocked criticism of the gestures in a post on X, saying: \"Frankly they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Musk, calling him a friend of the Jewish people and dismissing the criticism, saying the tech magnate had been \"falsely smeared.\" In the U.S., the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks antisemitism, called Musk's actions an \"awkward gesture,\" but said it was \"not a Nazi salute.\" In 2023,Musk threatened to sue the ADLfor defamation after the organization alleged hisX platform was enabling the spread of antisemitism. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, speaking a day before his nation welcomed survivors and foreign dignitaries for a memorial service to commemorate80 years since the liberationof the notorious Auschwitz Nazi death camp, condemned Musk's weekend remarks to the AfD gathering. \"The words we heard from the main actors of the AfD rally about 'Great Germany' and 'the need to forget German guilt for Nazi crimes' sounded all too familiar and ominous,\" Tusk said Sunday on social media. \"Especially only hours before the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.\" On Monday, as people gathered for the solemn memorial service at Auschwitz, Tusk said in a new post that \"the whole world should hear once more those words: NEVER AGAIN! We must not forget the tragic lesson of our past. Evil, violence and contempt cannot triumph anew. Under any circumstances!\" Germany is expected to hold a snap election in February, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence and his ruling coalition collapsed. The AfD, which recently became the first far-right party towin a state electionsince the Nazi era, has seen a surge in support. After Musk's remarks on Saturday, the leader of the AfD, Alice Weidel, thanked him and told the crowd: \"Let's make Germany great again.\" Late last year, the German government accused Musk of trying to influence the country's February elections when he published an op-ed in a local newspaper endorsing the AfD. \"It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election,\" a government spokesperson said on social media at the time, though the spokesperson said Musk was free to express his views, adding: \"After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.\" Anna Noryskiewiczcontributed to this report.

Starting Monday, stores are bringing back the condiment bar and offering free refills of certain drinks for for dine-in customers. The self-serve condiment bars, home to creamers, milk, sweeteners and stirrers, were removed from Starbucks locations during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starbucks previously said the return to letting customers do it themselves will help free up baristas to make other drinks. Starbucks is also bringing back reusable ceramic coffee mugs and glasses for customers who order drinks \"for here.\" \"Offering customers who sit and stay their beverages in ceramic mugs and glassware is one way we're returning our cafes to warm welcoming coffeehouses,\" a Starbucks spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"It's also another way that Starbucks is reducing waste and making each visit a more sustainable choice.\" More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups. Though the cafés offer recycling bins, arecent CBS News investigationfound that many of those cups don't actually end up getting recycled. It'sa problemthat goes far beyond Starbucks — fewrecycling facilitiesaround the country accept this type ofsingle-use plasticfor processing. Starbucks says it aims to reduce its overall waste by 50% by 2030, and it rolled outredesigned cupslast year made with up to 20% less plastic. Customers who order their drinks \"for here,\" in a reusable cup or mug, will also be eligible for free refills during that visit if they get hot or iced brewed coffee or tea at participating locations in the U.S. and Canada. But fans of cold brew, nitro cold brew, iced tea lemonade, flavored ice tea and Starbucks Refreshers are out of luck — those drinks are not included in the refill deal. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol last yearshared his visionof Starbucks becoming \"a welcoming coffee house where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee.\" Under his leadership, Starbucks also recentlyreversed its open-door policy, requiring people to make a purchase if they want to hang out at its coffee shops or use the restrooms. The open-doorpolicyhad been instituted in 2018, aftertwo Black menwere arrestedat a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByMark Strassmann,Samantha Wender January 27, 2025 / 8:01 PM EST/ CBS News Roberto Covarrubias and his family of six have lived in Altadena, California, for 10 years. Their American dream had four bedrooms, four bathrooms and 2,400 square feet. But disaster struck when theEaton Fireswept through their neighborhood. Virtually everything the family owned has settled into heaps of ash. Now they're facing a second disaster — a financial one. \"You're underinsured when it comes to the policy, there's clearly not going to be enough to make you whole again,\" said Alex Traslavina, a state-insured, independent insurance adjuster hired by fire victims to negotiate with insurance companies. Although Covarrubias'homeowners insurancepolicy covers more than $1 million in losses, it won't be enough. \"Based off your numbers, it's anywhere between $500,000 to $1 million short,\" Traslavina said. Traslavina estimates that many of the residents who lost their homes in theLos Angeles-area firesare underinsured, meaning the total cost of rebuilding will outpace what their insurance policies can afford them. For some victims, the loss is both total and totally out of pocket. Nationally, 12% of American homeowners have no home insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute. With premiums soaring, many of themdropped their coverage, rolled the dice and lost big in the disaster. \"I don't think most Americans understand that they're underinsured,\" said Dr. Jeremy Porter, who studies property values after natural disasters for nonprofit First Street. \"I think they see it as something they have to have.\" After Colorado'sMarshall Firein 2021, a roughly $2 billion disaster, an estimated three-fourths of victims discovered they wereunderinsured. \"If your home is completely destroyed, it's very difficult for most insurance policies to cover the complete rebuild of a property. So there's a second layer of revictimization,\" Porter said. That's where Covarrubias finds himself. His savings now compete with a million dollars in uninsured losses. Still, he's determined to rebuild. \"We're going to rebuild here. The property is worth it. The place is worth it. If Rome was burned, how many times did they rebuild? We'll rebuild Altadena,\" Covarrubias said. Mark Strassmann is CBS News' senior national correspondent based in Atlanta. He covers a wide range of stories, including space exploration.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByFaris Tanyos Updated on:  January 26, 2025 / 11:49 AM EST/ CBS News In his first interview since taking office, Vice President JD Vance on Saturday defended President Trump's flurry of executive orders, hispardonsof hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, and the new administration'saggressive effortsto deport undocumented immigrants. Vance dismissed concerns that the White House was not prioritizing U.S. economic fears, and argued that suspending the nation's refugee admissions program was justified. Here are some of the highlights of his wide-ranging interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Sunday. Vance on Friday night wasforced to cast the tie-breaking voteto push through the controversial confirmation of Pete Hegseth as defense secretary. This came after three Republican senators voted against Hegseth's nomination, leading to a brief 50-50 Senate stalemate, the smallest margin of approval for a defense secretary since the position was created. Hegseth's nomination had been questioned over allegations of alcohol abuse,sexual assaultand financial mismanagement. \"I think Pete is a disrupter, and a lot of people don't like that disruption,\" said Vance of the tight vote. \"If you think about all of those bipartisan, massive votes, we have to ask ourselves, what did they get us?\" he went on. \"They got us a country where we fought many wars over the last 40 years, but haven't won a war about as long as I've been alive.\" Vance said Hegseth's primary task will be \"to fix the problems at the Department of Defense,\" which he said included increasing recruitment numbers and fixing an \"incredibly broken\" weapons procurement process. \"If you look at where we are with the rise of artificial intelligence, with the rise of drone technology and drone warfare, we have to really, top to bottom, change the way that we fund the procurement of weapons, the way that we arm our troops,\" Vance said. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Mr. Trump'spick for director of national intelligence, has been oft-criticized for her contentious views on U.S. diplomatic issues. The Army National Guard veteran, who has no experience in the intelligence arena, received backlash for a 2017 trip she took to Syria in which she met with its since-deposed leaderBashar al-Assad, despite evidence even at the time that Assad had used chemical weapons against his own people. She also said in 2019 that Assad \"is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\" Vance brushed aside the criticismGabbard's nominationhas received from some conservative media outlets, saying he is \"confident\" that she \"will ultimately get through.\" He described her as a \"career military servant who's had a classification at the highest levels for nearly two decades,\" and \"a person who I think is going to bring some trust back to the intelligence services.\" When pressed on how she will instill public trust in agencies — which Gabbard has expressed distrust of in the past — Vance responded that Gabbard \"recognizes the bureaucrats have gotten out of control, and we need somebody there who's going to rein them in and return those services to their core mission of identifying information that's going to keep us safe.\" The Trump-Vance ticket campaigned on curbing inflation and lowering prices. When asked which of the Trump administration's early actions would help Americans financially, Vance cited \"a number of  executive orders that have caused, already, jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices.\" \"Capital investment\" will \"help lower prices,\" Vance said. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive orderdeclaringa national energy emergency, this despite the fact that crude oil production in the U.S. reached a record last year under the Biden administration. \"You asked specifically what executive order is going to help lower prices, all of the stuff that we've done on energy, to explore more energy reserves, to develop more energy resources in the United States of America,\" Vance said. Vance couldn't say when consumers may begin to see prices tick down. \"How does bacon get to the grocery store? It comes on trucks that are fueled by diesel fuel,\" Vance said. \"If the diesel is way too expensive, the bacon is going to become more expensive. How do we grow the bacon? Our farmers need energy to produce it. So if we lower energy prices, we are going to see lower prices for consumers, and that is what we're trying to fight for.\" While touring disaster zones Friday from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and the wildfires in Los Angeles, Mr. Trumpdisparagedthe Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said he  planned to sign an executive order that would \"begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA, or maybe getting rid of FEMA.\" And when asked how low-income states like Mississippi and Alabama would recover from natural disasters without FEMA's help, Vance responded that Mr. Trump \"is not saying we're going to leave anybody behind,\" but instead \"get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most.\" The vice president did not detail the particulars of what that would look like, but said FEMA \"has often been a disaster\" and criticized the agency for not working \"well enough with state and local officials to get resources to the people who need it.\" The Trump administration's first week has been marked by a wave of activity targeting U.S. immigration policy, includingsending hundreds of troopsto the southern border, haltingasylum proceedingsandlaunching deportation flightsto Guatemala for what it called \"illegal immigrant criminals.\" Among the most controversial was an orderrevokinga Biden-era policy that barred immigration agents from arresting immigrants near schools and places of worship. When asked by Brennan if the move would have \"a chilling effect\" on parents who may be hesitant to send their children to school, Vance responded, \"I desperately hope it has a chilling effect…on illegal immigrants coming into our country.\" The immigration ordersdrew condemnationthis week in a statement from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Vance said that as a \"practicing Catholic,\" he was \"heartbroken\" by the group's statement, accusing the organization, without evidence, of potentially having ulterior motives. \"I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?\" A federal judge this weekblockedMr. Trump's order attempting to eliminate birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which says \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" The judge, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, called the president's efforts \"blatantly unconstitutional.\" \"I obviously disagree with that judge,\" Vance told \"Face the Nation,\" citing the example of children of diplomats, for which there is already a carveout in the 14th Amendment. \"We're saying that that carve out should apply to anybody who doesn't plan to stay here,\" Vance said. \"If you come here on vacation and you have a baby in an American hospital, that baby doesn't become an American citizen. If you're an illegal alien and you come here temporarily, hopefully, your child does not become an American citizen by virtue of just having been born on American soil.\" When it was pointed out the U.S. is a nation of immigrants, Vance responded, \"This is a very unique country, and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers. But just because we were founded by immigrants, doesn't mean that 240 years later that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world. No country says that temporary visitors — their children will be given complete access to the benefits and blessings of American citizenship.\" But according to theCIA's World Factbook, there are 30 nations with some form of birthright citizenship. Hours after taking office on Jan. 20, Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, leaving thousands of Afghans stranded at airports, some of whom had worked with the U.S. prior to its withdrawal from Afghanistan. Vancepreviouslytold \"Face the Nation\" in August that \"I don't think we should abandon anybody who's been properly vetted and actually helped us.\" The refugee program is an 18- to 24-month process that involves interviews, medical screenings and security vetting. Refugee applicants must prove they are fleeing persecution before being allowed into the U.S. Vance on Saturday seemed to reverse course, questioning whether the program had \"properly vetted\" the refugees. \"Now that we know that we have vetting problems with a lot of these refugee programs, we absolutely cannot unleash thousands of unvetted people into our country,\" Vance declared, without detailing how the refugee program's vetting process may be faulty. He provided the example of an Afghan national who came to the U.S. immediately after the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The manwas arrestedin Oklahoma in October on federal charges of planning an election day terrorist attack in support of the Islamic State. \"He was allegedly properly vetted, and many people in the media and the Democratic Party said that he was properly vetted,\" Vance claimed of the suspect. \"Clearly, he wasn't.\" However, as CBS News has reported, that suspect did not arrive via the refugee process. Instead, he was paroled into the country, like most Afghan evacuees, and allowed to live in the country temporarily under that immigration authority while he applied for a Special Immigrant Visa. As he had vowed during the campaign, Mr. Trump pardoned about 1,500 people who were charged in connection with theJan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. When asked why Jan. 6 defendants who had committed acts of violence deserved to be pardoned, Vance put blame on the Justice Department, saying \"it denied constitutional protections in the prosecutions,\" and he alleged, without evidence, that there were \"double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups.\" On the blanket nature of the pardons, Vance said, \"What the president said consistently on the campaign…is that he was going to look at a case by case basis…and that's exactly what we did.\" \"We looked at 1,600 cases,\" Vance continued. \"And the thing that came out of it, Margaret, is that there was a massive denial of due process of liberty, and a lot of people were denied their constitutional rights. The president believes that. I believe that, and I think he made the right decision.\" A group of federal judges in Washington, D.C.,blasted Trump's pardonsin a series of separate orders this week. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said the charges had been \"fully supported\" by videos, photos, admissions by defendants themselves during plea hearings, and the testimony of law enforcement and congressional staff who were at the Capitol. Vance said that while \"violence against a police officer is not justified,\" former Attorney General Merrick Garland had \"weaponized\" the Justice Department. The in-person audience at President Trump's inauguration was awho's who of tech giants, including Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. But when Vance spoke to \"Face the Nation\" in August, he said that companies like Google are \"too big, too powerful.\" \"We ought to take the Teddy Roosevelt approach to some of them. Break 'em up. Don't let them control what people are allowed to say,\" Vance said at the time. Amazon, Meta and OpenAIwere among several companiesthat made $1 million donations to Mr. Trump's inaugural fund. When asked whether he still planned to take a hard stance against Big Tech, Vance said the tech leaders at the inauguration \"didn't have as good of seating as my mom.\" \"We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power,\" Vance said. \"They're very much on notice.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez,Melissa Quinn,Kathryn WatsonandAimee Picchicontributed to this report.

The earthquake with a magnitude of 3.8 happened at 10:22 a.m. It was initially reported as a magnitude of 4.1 and then 3.9. \"This is like aonce-in-every-five-years kind of earthquake,\" John Ebel, a senior scientist with the Weston Observatory at Boston College, told WBZ-TV. The depth of theearthquakewas more than eight miles underground, according to the USGS. There was no tsunami threat to New England, the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center reported. \"We don't sit on any active fault lines,\" WBZ-TV executive weather producer Terry Eliasen said. \"But again for our area [it] is really significant.\" Shaking could be felt for a few seconds in the area, as well as in the WBZ-TV newsroom in Boston.

Ebel said \"there certainly will be aftershocks that will be recorded seismically.\" \"If the aftershocks get to be, you know, magnitude 2.8, 3,0, or 3.1, let's say those will be felt probably by the people in the North Shore area of Massachusetts as well as coastal New Hampshire and south coastal Maine,\" he said. Last year, a4.8 earthquakecentered in New Jersey wasfelt in parts of Massachusetts. Police and fire scanner audio from York County, Maine captured the initial response to the earthquake. \"We're not sure what's going on. We're getting calls from all over town about an explosion,\" a dispatcher can be heard saying. \"We had a very large shake here at the station as well,\" another person says. Residents in York say it was a frightening experience. \"I was standing right here, and it was 'boom,' and then instantly, all at once, the whole house was shaking. And I looked up and the lights were swinging,\" Cindy McKenna said, \"Ipicked up and called 911, then I just ran outside.\" \"I was vacuuming, and all the sudden, it sounded like a truck or an airplane engine or something, I mean, and the house shook,\" said Gene Raymond. \"A couple of things fell off my shelf and we literally thought something exploded, that's what it sounded like, the building shook,\" Dawn Milbury said Nancy Begert was working at an OB/GYN office in Portland, Maine when the building started to shake. \"We all kind of looked at each other, like, what's happening? And then when it was done, we said, 'I think that was an earthquake,\" Begert said. \"One of the girls in another room had something fall off the desk, but no damage.\" The Maine Emergency Management Agency was asking residents not to call 911 unless there was an emergency. But they did ask residents to make sure they check for any damage to their homes. \"That's the standard thing you should do after an earthquake. Check your house, make sure nothing cracked. If you have a hook up of some sort of flammable heating source make sure you check that to make sure nothing was damaged\" Emergency Management Director, Nicole Pastana said. Neal J.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByKathryn Watson,Eleanor Watson,Sara Cook Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 9:28 PM EST/ CBS News President Trump signed multiple executive orders Monday night that could reshape the management and composition of the military, with provisions addressing diversity measures, transgender service members, and troops who were discharged for refusing COVID vaccinations. He also signed an executive order to establish a process to develop what the administration is calling an American Iron Dome — a missile defense shield for the homeland. (Iron Domeis the name often used forIsrael's systemfor intercepting rockets, which was developed withU.S. support.) Mr. Trump signed the four orders aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington from a stop in Florida. One of the orders would reinstate members of the military who were discharged for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. About 8,200 service members weredischargedfor refusing to comply with the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, according to data provided by the service branches. However, the mandate was rescindedin January 2023by the Biden administration, and since then, about 110 service members have rejoined the military. The president also signed an executive order directing the Pentagon to determine a policy for transgender service members based on readiness, a White House official said. The action does not immediately ban transgender service members. \"To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone,\" Mr Trump said about his plans at a retreat with House Republicans Monday at his property in Doral, Florida. Another order addressesdiversity, equity and inclusioninitiatives in the military, banning the use of race- or sex-based preferences in the armed forces, the Defense Department and the Homeland Security Department. \"I ordered the end to all of the lawless diversity, equity and inclusion nonsense policies across the government and all across the private sector and the military,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP retreat. \"We're getting it out and we've gotten it out pretty much. We did that in one week, and it wasn't that easy, but everybody wanted it.\" Under this order, the defense secretary and homeland security secretary are to review the curriculum at the service academies and other academic institutions to ensure DEI and \"gender ideologies\" are eliminated. The president announced plans last week toend DEI initiativesacross the federal government, and the Office of Personnel Management ordered all federalDEI employeesto be placed on leave.

In some cases, it was pure luck whichever way the wind blew. But in others, homeowners believe they were spared because of steps they took long before the flames erupted. Some of those steps began with how the home was built. The houses that remain stand out amidst the devastation in Pacific Palisades and Altadena. Kelly Kline's home in Malibu wasn't one of them. \"No firemen even showed up at all,\" Kline said. \"There's no firemen, there's no help, so these houses were just sacrificed.\" But right next door to Kline's home, his neighbor's is still standing. \"It's like a green oasis in the middle of a warzone,\" said Harry Statter, the founder of Frontline Wildfire Defense System. Frontline is one of the growing number of companies that will install a sophisticated sprinkler setup on your home. In 2023, CBS News Los Angeles first reported that Frontline has an app that can deploy sprinklers and fire retardant even if you're not home. \"If the customer enables that, our software platform will detect fire relative to the location of your home, it'll also detect wind gusts and fuel conditions and it'll activate your system on your behalf,\" Statter said. \"When embers land on those materials, whether it be patio furniture, front door mats, adjacent plant fuels, they're in a condition that's too wet to burn.\" Starting at about $500 a month, the system is far from cheap but has gotten Kline's attention. \"Very surprised that any house could make it through that. I think absolutely have to build differently,\" Kline said. \"I think everybody mostly who's going to rebuild will build with fire safety in mind definitely.\" Nancy and James Evans designed their home in the hills above Malibu based on the trauma of losing their first one in the Old Topanga Fire of 1993. It consumed everything including the valuable artwork Jim had created over the course of his career. \"We have a cement floor all the way through this whole level. We have the slate, which is also in our bathrooms and our showers and things,\" Nancy said. \"Then we have our beautiful metal fireplace.\" Their architect framed the fortress entirely of steel. Every door is made of metal, and the very few pieces of wood inside are purely decorative. When the Palisades Fire roared into their neighborhood nearly every structure there was destroyed or damaged. The blaze burned up to the Evans' front door. \"Nothing defended this house. There was no water drops. There was nobody with a hose. This house just like sat here in the middle of this, surrounded by fire,\" Jim said. Their home was essentially untouched. \"There's a few places where the glass is cracked on a couple of windows, but by and large, it held up really, really well,\" said John Souza, the Evans' architect. This time, the Evans' home and art survived but both their hearts are breaking for so many neighbors who have so much work ahead of them. \"It's hard to imagine any man, woman, or child in Los Angeles right now that wasn't touched by this particular tragedy,\" Jim said. \"This is like a hole in the soul of Los Angeles in a way that won't be healed for quite a while.\" The Evans have two sons. One lost his home in the Eaton Fire and the other is still evacuated from the Palisades Fire, but he was one of the lucky few whose homes survived.

        "content": "Watch CBS News BySara Moniuszko,Taylor Johnston Edited ByPaula Cohen,Allison Elyse Gualtieri Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 2:19 PM EST/ CBS News In hisinauguralspeech, President Trump vowed to \"keep our children healthy and disease free,\" but his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services,Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has along historyofraising doubtsaboutvaccines— despite decades of evidence showing they've saved millions of people from debilitating illness or death. \"People forget what it used to be (before vaccines),\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on\"CBS Mornings Plus,\"pointing to data showing a huge decline in cases and deaths from these diseases compared with pre-vaccine levels. \"If you look at the 10 top childhood illnesses every year, vaccines prevent more than 1 million cases and more than 10,000 deaths\" in the U.S., he said. Worldwide, the numbers are even greater, with anestimated2-3 million lives saved by childhood vaccinations each year. Here's what else to know about the impact of vaccines. Vaccines work by imitating organisms like viruses and bacteria without making you sick. \"That gives your immune system a chance to build up defenses so you're better prepared to fight a future infection,\" LaPook said. Your immune system creates specific defenses called antibodies against the imitation pathogen — known as an antigen — introduced by the vaccine. \"An antigen might be a germ that has been killed or changed so it cannot cause disease. It can be something that looks or behaves like a pathogen, a harmless part of a pathogen, or instructions for the body to manufacture the harmless part,\"according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Then if you encounter the actual pathogen later in life, your immune system is prepared to respond quickly to fight it. Some vaccines effectively block illness, while others help prevent you from getting more severely sick if infected. So while it is true you can still get some illnesses after you've been vaccinated — like theflu or COVID, for example — the vaccines are still helpful in reducing the risk of severe illness or death. If your body has a strong immune reaction to a vaccine, you might feel tired or experience body aches, headache, swollen lymph nodes or even a fever, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. These potential side effects are normal and typically last no more than a day or two. Vaccines have vastly reduced deaths in early childhood and largely eradicated certain diseases that used to cause dreaded epidemics. A recentstudyled by the World Health Organizationestimatesthat vaccines, including immunizations againstpolio,measlesand 12 other once-common diseases, have saved an estimated 154 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years. Measles vaccines alone have averted the deaths of about 94 million people, the analysis found. In recent years, however, withbackslidingimmunization rates, health officials are starting to see the effects of skipping shots. \"We don't have to remember too far back to see what happens because of vaccination rates, when there aren't requirements and people don't have access,\" Dr. Carolyn Bridges, the CDC's former associate director for adult immunizations, recentlytold CBS News, citing apolio casethat emerged in New Yorkin 2022. \"That's just mind-boggling that we can have a polio resurgence, in a country with all of our resources. It doesn't take all that much for diseases still circulating in other places to retake hold.\" Outbreaks of polioonce killed thousands of Americans and left many survivors paralyzed, until the disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. by vaccines that first rolled out in the 1950s. For decades now, the polio vaccine (inactivated polio vaccine or IPV) has been part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in the U.S., as it's the best way to protect against the virus. There is no cure. A total of four doses is recommended for the best level of protection. Research shows two doses of IPV provideabout 90% protectionwhile three doses provideat least 99% protection. Despite being easily preventablewith a readily available vaccine,measles caseshave beenon the risein recent years, due largely to an uptick in people skipping vaccination. Measles is highly contagious, andlower vaccination ratesgive it an opening to spread. Before the vaccine became available in the 1960s, measles was very common in childhood. About 48,000 Americans were hospitalized for it each year, andabout 500, mostly children, would die. One dose of the MMR vaccine, which covers measles, mumps and rubella, is93% effectiveagainst measles and the recommended two doses is 97% effective, research shows. Most people who are vaccinated will be protected for life,majorhealthorganizationssay. Rubella, also known as German measles, is especially dangerous during pregnancy, when it can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects. During amajor outbreakin the U.S. in the mid-1960s, before the vaccine,records show11,000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2,100 newborns died, and about 20,000 babies were born with lifelong disabilities due to the virus. The MMR vaccine, first introduced in 1971, isabout 97% effectiveat preventing rubella after just one dose, research shows. Though rubella is no longer endemic — meaning constantly present — in the United States, it remains a problem in other parts of the world. This means it can be brought into the U.S. by people infected in other countries, making vaccination important to prevent illness and outbreaks. Alexander Tincontributed to this report.

        "content": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 2:22 PM EST/ CBS/AFP Theworld's biggest iceberg-- three time the size of New York City -- could drift towards a remote island where a scientist warns it risks disrupting feeding for baby penguins and seals. The gigantic wall of ice is movingslowly from Antarcticaon a potential collision course with South Georgia, acrucial wildlife breeding groundin the South Atlantic. Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday. He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks. But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said. It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands. Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces. Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. Theisland hosts1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins — one of the world's largest colonies — about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds. \"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said. Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known asA23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted atime-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement. Meijers -- who encountered the iceberg face to face while leading a scientific mission in late 2023 -- described \"a huge white cliff, 40 or 50 meters high, that stretches from horizon to horizon\". \"It's just like this white wall. It's very sort of Game of Thrones-esque, actually,\" he said, referring to the dark fantasy series. A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendaryshipwreck was discoveredoff the coast of Antarctica in 2022. Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia. \"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said. \"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said. Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed. It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young. \"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers. \"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\" The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said. As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. While icebergs are natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to human induced climate change. In January 2023,  a massive piece of Antarctica's Brunt Ice Shelf — achunk about the size of two New York Cities— broke free.  The Brunt Ice Shelf lies across the Weddell Sea from the site of the Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula. In 2022, the Larsen C ice shelf — which was roughly the size of New York City and was long considered to be stable —collapsed into the sea. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByCamilo Montoya-Galvez Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 9:10 AM EST/ CBS News Washington— President Trump will hold off on imposing steep tariffs on Colombia after the country's government agreed to accept deported migrants being returned on military planes, the White House said Sunday night. Mr. Trump earlier on Sunday vowed swift and punishing retaliation after the Colombian government over the weekend blocked the arrival ofdeportation flightsfrom the U.S., objecting to the Trump administration's efforts to usemilitary planes to deport migrants. Mr. Trump posted on social media on Sunday that his administration would put in place several actions against Colombia, including a 25% tariff — that he said would be raised to 50% after one week — on all goods coming into the U.S. from Colombia. He also announced a travel ban and \"immediate visa revocation\" for Colombian government officials and \"their allies,\" visa sanctions on Colombian authorities and their relatives and enhanced customs inspections on travelers and cargo from Colombia. \"These measures are just the beginning,\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!\" But late Sunday night, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay. Based on this agreement, the fully drafted IEEPA tariffs and sanctions will be held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement.\" \"The visa sanctions issued by the State Department, and enhanced inspections from Customs and Border Protection, will remain in effect until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned,\" Leavitt's statement said. Colombia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement the country had \"overcome the impasse\" with the U.S., and said its foreign minister and ambassador would travel to Washington, D.C., \"in the next few hours\" to continue discussing the agreement. \"We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees, guaranteeing them dignified conditions, as citizens subject to rights,\" the Foreign Ministry said. The ministry's statement made no mention of U.S. military planes, but said Colombia's presidential plane would be used to return migrants who had been scheduled to be deported Sunday morning. A senior Trump administration official had earlier told CBS News the use of the presidential plane would not be enough to stave off Mr. Trump's proposed tariffs and sanctions. A senior administration official earlier Sunday said Mr. Trump's actions amounted to \"a clear message\" to countries that they \"have an obligation to accept repatriation flights.\" Prior to Sunday night's announced agreement, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on social media \"Your blockade doesn't scare me,\" and said Colombia would respond to the raised tariffs with a 50% tariff of its own on U.S. goods. In reference to the travel ban, Petro said, \"I don't really like traveling to the U.S., it's a bit boring.\" Petro also predicted the U.S. could \"try to carry out a coup with your economic strength and your arrogance, like they did with Allende. ... Overthrow me, President, and the Americas and humanity will respond,\" Petro wrote. In a statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was Colombia's responsibility to take back citizens who are illegally in the U.S. \"in a serious and expeditious manner.\" \"Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air,\" Rubio said. \"As demonstrated by today's actions, we are unwavering in our commitment to end illegal immigration and bolster America's border security.\" Later Sunday, the State Department confirmed Rubio had \"ordered a suspension of visa issuance at the U.S. Embassy Bogota consular section.\" \"Secretary Rubio is now authorizing travel sanctions on individuals and their families, who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations,\" the State Department said. \"Measures will continue until Colombia meets its obligations to accept the return of its own citizens. America will not back down when it comes to defending its national security interests.\" A U.S. official told CBS News that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was already implementing a travel ban on Colombian government officials and diplomats traveling with what are known as A and G visas as of Sunday night. The agency had also started enhanced customs inspections on cargo from Colombia, the official added. CBP later confirmed those actions in a public statement. Earlier on Sunday, Petrosaidhe rejected the deportation flights because the deportees were being transported in military aircraft, arguing such a move treated migrants as criminals. \"The United States must establish a protocol for the dignified treatment of migrants before we receive them,\" Petrowroteon social media. He added that he would accept deportation flights, as long as they were conducted on civilian planes. A U.S. official told CBS that the Colombian migrants who were scheduled to be deported on Sunday on these planes were back in the U.S. and will remain in DHS custody until a new agreement was reached. Two U.S. officials told CBS News there were two Department of Defense planes with migrant deportees expected to land in Colombia on Sunday, after departing the San Diego area near the southern border. But those plans were scrapped overnight. One of the U.S. officials said the plan was to deport roughly 80 Colombian migrants on each military plane. Colombia's decision to block the U.S. deportation flights over the weekend was an early diplomatic setback for the Trump administration as it lays the foundation for its promised mass deportation campaign and crackdown on illegal immigration. As part of that crackdown, President Trump has moved to vastly increase the role the U.S. military plays in immigration enforcement, declaring a national emergency to deploy an additional 1,500 Army soldiers and Marines to the southern border. The troops have been assigned to erect border barriers and help Customs and Border Protection in an operational capacity. Long-standing legal limits bar the use of soldiers for the civil enforcement of laws, including U.S. immigration law. Earlier in the week, the administration used military aircraft to deport Guatemalan migrants who had crossed the southern border illegally back to Guatemala, publicizing the move as the start of their mass deportation effort.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByCara Tabachnick Updated on:  January 26, 2025 / 6:12 PM EST/ CBS News Vice President JD Vanceblasted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops condemnation of the Trump administration's recent actions on immigration, saying the church might be more concerned with \"their bottom line\" than humanitarian causes. On \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" the Vice President, in his first interview since being sworn in on Jan. 20, said several orders targeting immigration were enacted under President Trump to fulfill the promises made during his campaign. Hours after the inauguration, the Trump administrationrevoked a policythat prohibited arrests by U.S. immigration agents at or near schools, places of worship and other places deemed to be \"sensitive locations.\" Vance said Saturday that the order — along with several other immigration actions — empowers \"law enforcement to enforce the law everywhere, to protect Americans.\"  The Trump administration issued roughly 200 executive actions during their first days in office, including denyingbirthright citizenshipto the children of unauthorized immigrants and temporary visa holders — which hasseveral legal challenges. His other executive actions, including the ICE order, could face legal challenges. However, it was the church and schools order that drew ire from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Mark. J Seitz, migration committee chairman U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops,told CBS News\"Many of these policies we see going against the basic tenets of our faith.\" Vance, a devout Catholic, sharply rebuked the bishops' condemnation. \"Because as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement,\" he said. Vance told Brennan the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \"has, frankly, not been a good partner in common sense immigration enforcement that the American people voted for.\" Brennan asked Vance if he specifically supported immigration agents going into churches and schools, and \"conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school.\" Vance said he \"supports us doing law enforcement against violent criminals, whether they're illegal immigrants or anybody else, in a way that keeps us safe.\" Vance asked if the bishops were more worried about their bottom line, noting they received over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants. He said he hopes \"as a devout Catholic, that they'll do better.\" In response, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said Sunday in a statement, \"Faithful to the teaching of Jesus Christ, the Catholic Church has a long history of serving refugees.\" \"In 1980, the bishops of the United States began partnering with the federal government to carry out this service when Congress created the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Every person resettled through USRAP is vetted and approved for the program by the federal government while outside of the United States,\" the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said. \"In our agreements with the government, the USCCB receives funds to do this work; however, these funds are not sufficient to cover the entire cost of these programs. Nonetheless, this remains a work of mercy and ministry of the Church.\" Many resettlement refugee agencies are faith-based groups. On Friday many of these groups were also told some of their federal funding would be suspended days after Trump enactedan indefinite pauseon admissions of refugees to the United States. Trump also enacted orders to enlist the military's aid in border enforcement through an emergency declaration, expand detention sites to hold deportees and increase agreements with local law enforcement authorities.

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Watch CBS News ByDaniel Klaidman Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 4:52 PM EST/ CBS News Days before this week's high-stakes confirmation hearing ofKash Patelto be FBI director, a bureau insider has come forward with new information questioning Patel's judgment during sensitive hostage rescue missions, CBS News has learned. The whistleblower, whose identity is being withheld by Senate Democrats for fear of retaliation, worked with the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which leads the government's missions to rescue hostages overseas. The whistleblower alleges that Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep such operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified. In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\" According to the letter, on Oct. 14 at 10:55 a.m., theWall Street Journalpublished a story in which Patel confirmed that the two American captives and the remains of a third were exchanged for two hundred Houthi fighters who were being held in Saudi Arabia. According to the letter, the news report was published \"several hours before the hostages were in the confirmed custody of the United States.\" In the end the Americans returned home safely, but FBI officials involved in the mission were livid over Patel's leak, which they regarded as reckless and potentially risking tragic results. Democratic senators sent the letter Monday morning to Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Acting Treasury Secretary David Lebryk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. It asks for all records of communications between Patel and the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell concerning the rescue of the captives, as well as any records reflecting authorization for him to disclose the hostage deal before there was confirmation that the Americans were safely in U.S, hands. No Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed the letter. A source close to the confirmation said in response to the allegations, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the court room to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\" Alex Gray, former chief of staff for the National Security Council during the first Trump administration, said in a statement, \"The anonymous allegations in this letter are simply absurd to anyone who has ever actually worked with Kash Patel. In everything he did at the NSC and DoD, Kash put the interests of the American people, and particularly the interests of American hostages and unlawful detainees and their families, first.\" \"The success President Trump and his NSC had on the counter terrorism and hostage recovery missions was in no small part due to Kash's skill and professionalism,\" Gray said. He referred to the whistleblower's allegations as \"baseles\" and \"the last gasp of discredited political opponents of President Trump.\" The Durbin letter offers a glimpse into the Democratic strategy for Thursday's confirmation hearing. Knowledgeable sources tell CBS News that senators will seek to show that Patel has engaged in a pattern of poor judgment and self-aggrandizement regarding sensitive life-and-death missions and use that portrayal to cast doubt on his fitness to lead the FBI. The letter says any official \"who puts missions or the lives of Americans in jeopardy for public notoriety and personal gain is unfit to lead the country's primary federal law enforcement and investigative agency.\" The Democrats plan to highlight another instance where Patel has been criticized for his handling of a sensitive operation aimed at freeing American captives. Two weeks after the Yemen hostage deal, Patel found himself in the middle of another high-risk operation. Philip Walton was a 27-year-old American who had been seized by armed men at his farm in Niger, near the Nigerian border. The kidnappers transported Walton to Nigeria and demanded a million dollars in ransom. There were also indications that the kidnappers were contemplating turning him over to a terrorist group operating in the region. Patel was accompanying President Trump on a visit to Fort Bragg, the military installation in North Carolina that is home to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. While they were there, Patel received intelligence that Walton would be held at an encampment for several hours, enough time to stage a daring Seal Team 6 raid to rescue the hostage. Mr. Trump signed off on the operation, which involved parachuting into Northern Nigeria and trekking for miles to the compound where Walton was being held. Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esperhad greenlit the plan, but there were still some final questions that needed to be answered before he could give the go order – primarily whether the Nigerian government had given the U.S. permission to use its air space. According to Esper's memoir, Patel, who was the senior director for counterterrorism at the time, assured Defense Department officials that the State Department had received the necessary permission from the Nigerians. But Patel's information was incorrect: the Nigerians had not given their approval. By this time, Air Force planes carrying the Navy SEALs were in the air just a few miles from the Nigerian border. Esper wrote in his memoir, \"A Sacred Oath,\" he realized the government had to make an agonizing decision. He told the White House they could go forward with the operation and risk having their planes shot down — or abort the mission and miss a crucial opportunity to save Walton.  But at the last minute, word came that the State Department had received clearance to use Nigerian airspace. The mission went forward, was executed flawlessly, and Walton was returned to safety. But Esper and other officials were furious at the role Patel had played, believing he had inserted himself into the operation in violation of regular protocol, and then nearly botched it by transmitting false information. According to Esper's account, Patel's carelessness carried significant risk for the SEALs. \"I was concerned that being packed in an aircraft burning holes in the sky for an extra hour or so would wear on the special operators, that it might affect their readiness somehow,\" he wrote in his memoir. Esper also wrote of the incident, \"My team suspected Patel made the approval story up, but they didn't have all the facts.\" Patel has denied Esper's version of events. In his own book, \"Government Gangsters,\" Patel portrays Esper as a \"deep-state\" actor who \"always seemed to be subverting the president's agenda,\" including by putting up obstacles to counterterrorism raids in Africa and the Middle East.\" He argued that Mr. Trump had the ultimate authority to order the mission. Last week, Durbin met with Patel and asked him about Esper's account of his role in the nearly botched Nigerian raid. Sources said Patel again refuted Esper's version of events. Durbin did not yet have the whistleblower's information about the Yemen hostage deal, but he is expected to closely question the FBI nominee about that episode at Thursday's confirmation hearing. However Patel's answers those questions, there is no suspense as to how Durbin and his fellow Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote. After his meeting with Patel, Durbin issued a statement saying he will not vote to confirm Patel. \"Kash Patel has neither the experience, the temperament, nor the judgment to lead the FBI,\" his statement said.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByAliza Chasan January 27, 2025 / 8:56 PM EST/ CBS News A California woman was sentenced to more than three years behind bars for her role in a \"birth tourism\" scheme in which women traveled to the U.S. to give birth, giving the child birthright citizenship, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California confirmed. Jing Dong, also known as Phoebe Dong, and her husband, Michael Wei Yueh Liu, wereconvictedin September on one charge each of conspiracy and 10 counts of international money laundering. Liu was sentenced last year to 41 months in prison, the same sentence Dong received. While the case is years old, the sentencing comes as President Donald Trump seeks to end birthright citizenship. He instituted anexecutive orderin an attempt to end it, but a federal judge in Seattletemporarily blockedthe order. Under the 14th Amendment, children born in the U.S. are considered American citizens. Some expectant mothers travel to the U.S. to give birth as a way of gaining American citizenship for their children. Dong and Liu were among more than a dozen people indicted in 2019 onbirth tourismcharges. The 19 individuals charged, who were linked to three different schemes, allegedly helped thousands give birth in the U.S. According toauthorities, the three businesses advertised the U.S. as being \"the most attractive nationality\" with better educational resources, including \"free education from junior high school to public high school.\" \"America's way of life is not for sale,\" Joseph Macias, then special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations Los Angeles, said in a2019 press releaseabout the indictments. \"HSI will aggressively target those who would make a mockery of our laws and our values to benefit and enrich themselves. No one needs to be reminded about the national security and public safety implications of visa fraud and the crimes associated with it. Anyone who would exploit our nation's generosity and our legal immigration system should be on notice - they may end up being the ones to pay a very steep price.\" Between January 2012 and March 2015, Dong and Liu charged Chinese clients tens of thousands of dollars to help them give birth in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice. They ran a maternity house in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and rented apartment units to pregnant Chinese women. The women would usually return to China within one to two months of giving birth. While pregnant individuals can visit the U.S.,Customs and Border Protectionon its website notes that officers will take into account a pregnant individual's due date and the length of time they plan to stay in the U.S. when deciding if that person will be allowed into the country. Liu and Dong would advise their customers on how to hide their pregnancies, authorities said. Through their business USA Happy Baby Inc., they'd advise customers to fly into the U.S. through \"ports of entry withperceived less customs scrutiny, such as Hawaii, before flying to Los Angeles, to wear loose fitting clothing, to favor certain lines at customs that they perceived to be less strict, and on how to answer the customs officials' questions,\" the Justice Department said.

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Watch CBS News ByAimee Picchi Edited ByAlain Sherter Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 8:08 PM EST/ CBS News A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention — and sending a shock wave through Wall Street — due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT. DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years,accordingto Goldman Sachs. On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said. \"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\" DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after Mr. Trump announced anew $500 billion venturewith ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history,accordingto CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%. Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%. Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy. DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,accordingto the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note. Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported. Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\" The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at itswebsite. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app. On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in thepost, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time. The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector. \"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\" DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\" Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessenwritingon X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\" David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy,saidon social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\" However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses. \"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\" Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email. \"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said. It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Departmentnot to enforcea looming ban. In the meantime, major tech companies including Meta and Microsoft are slated to report earnings this week, where investors will likely hear more from their executives about their AI plans and their thoughts on DeepSeek, experts said. Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector. \"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report. In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek. \"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-timescaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\" But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\" Aimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByHaley Ott,Ramy Inocencio Updated on:  January 25, 2025 / 9:01 PM EST/ CBS News Hamas released four Israeli hostages in Gaza early Saturday in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners to be released later in the day. It was the second release to occur aspart of the ceasefire agreementthat began last weekend. Israel followed with the release of 200 Palestinian prisoners. A large crowd gathered in Palestine Square in northern Gaza to witness the handover of the hostages to the Red Cross. A number of armed Hamas militants in uniforms gathered for the release, surrounding a podium displaying Hamas slogans. Drones could be seen dropping small packages, which Israeli media reported contained candy, to the crowd. Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19, were captured in Hamas'Oct. 7 2023 terrorist attackthat ignited the Israel-Hamas war. Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel, and over 47,000 have since been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run ministry of health. The four female soldiers were kidnapped from the Nahal Oz military base, on the border with northern Gaza, when Palestinian militants overran it on Oct. 7. They had been serving in a lookout unit there. The White House said in a statement on Saturday that it celebrates their release and that the United States will \"continue with its great partner Israel to push for the release of all remaining hostages and the pursuit of peace throughout the region.\" Ahead of their release, members of the Red Cross were brought up on the podium in Palestine Square, where they signed documents alongside Hamas militants. The four Israeli women arrived in the square in cars. They emerged wearing military-style uniforms and were brought onto the podium as well, where, smiling, they gave thumbs up gestures and waved to the crowd. They then got into Red Cross vehicles and began their journeys out of Gaza. In Tel Aviv, crowds gathered to celebrate the hostages' return to Israel after 476 days of captivity. Over 60 other soldiers were killed at the Nahal Oz base during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, and one other female soldier was taken hostage from the same unit, though she was not included in Saturday's release. Liri Albag's family has said she had managed to pass messages back to them through other hostages who had been released previously. Before today's release, seven Israeli women were thought to be held in Gaza, including five IDF service members and two civilians. One of the civilians is Arbel Yehoud, who was abducted fromKibbutz Nir Oz. The other Israeli civilian isShiri Bibas, who was taken with her two young children Ariel and Kfir. Hamas has claimed that Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were later killed in an Israeli bombing in Gaza. In a TV interview in June, then-Israeli minister Benny Gantz indicated that the government knew what had happened to the Bibas family, but said it could not provide details. According to the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, civilian hostages were to be released ahead of soldiers, and Yehoud was expected to be among the four released on Saturday. \"Hamas failed to meet its obligations to first release Israeli female civilian hostages as part of the agreement,\" IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a statement after the release. \"We are determined to return Arbel Yehoud, an Israeli citizen kidnapped from Nir Oz, and also Shiri Bibas and her two children, Kfir and Ariel, whose welfare we are extremely concerned about. We appreciate and thank the efforts of all the international mediators, the United States, Qatar and Egypt. And we expect them to make sure Hamas stands in accordance with the agreement.\" Israel's Prime Minister's Office said the exchange of Palestinian prisoners would go ahead, but that people in Gaza would not be allowed to cross the Netzarim Corridor. \"Today, Israel received four kidnapped female soldiers from the terrorist organization Hamas, and in return will release security prisoners according to the set key,\" Israel's Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. \"In accordance with the agreement, Israel will not allow the passage of Gazans to the north of the Gaza Strip - until the release of the citizen Arbel Yehoud, who was supposed to be released today, is arranged.\" Al Jazeera reported that a senior Hamas official said Yehoud would be released next Saturday. Israel's Prison Service later said it had completed the release of 200 Palestinians, including 121 serving life sentences. They are expected to be sent to Gaza, Egypt and potentially other countries in the region. After Saturday's exchange, Israeli forces are expected to begin withdrawing from the central road that divides northern and southern Gaza from east to west, called the Netzarim Corridor. Palestinian civilians who weredisplaced from northern Gazashould then be able to travel back, though during this stage of the ceasefire agreement, they will only be allowed to make their way on foot. Some displaced Palestinians who were able to return to their homes in the south following the first hostage and prisoner exchange last weekend found nothing left but rubble, and in some cases, only the skeletal remains of loved ones killed in the fighting. TheIsrael-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release dealis expected to occur in phases, with each phase negotiated during the phase that comes before it. The first phase, which began last Saturday, includes the release by Hamas of 33 hostages over a six week period. They include women, children and hostages over 50 years old, a draft viewed by CBS News said. On the first day of the deal, three hostages were released by Hamas. On the seventh day - which is today - four hostages were released. After that, Hamas is expected to release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died. Over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel are also expected to be released in the first phase of the deal.

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Watch CBS News ByJim Axelrod,Matthew Mosk,Michael Kaplan Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 8:09 PM EST/ CBS News The Chinese intelligence officer who convinced Thomas Zhao to hand over sensitive information about the U.S. military seemed to know the 24-year-old U.S. Navy petty officer had a passion for the stock market. The agent approached Zhao in a stock trading chat group on the Chinese-owned social media network WeChat, CBS News learned in interviews with people involved in the case. But chats about investment strategies soon veered into sensitive areas, including questions about Naval exercises in the Pacific and designs for radar installations. The Zhao case represents a new dimension to Chinese covert activities that counterintelligence officials are calling \"virtual espionage.\" The practice, in which Chinese intelligence officers target members of the military and others of high interest on social media, draw them into correspondence, and extract sensitive information from them, is a rising threat, officials told CBS News. \"They will turn over every stone to try and collect what they can,\" Kevin Vorndran, who leads the FBI's counterintelligence division, told CBS News in a rare television interview. \"They are certainly endeavoring to target as many people as they can.\" Over the course of two years, a Chinese intelligence officer paid Zhao, a U.S. citizen and Navy engineer, about $15,000 to take photographs and videos of restricted areas at the Southern California base where he worked, court records revealed. With his relatively low rank, as well as a low-level security clearance, Zhao may have seemed like an unlikely target. Yet Vorndran and other U.S. officials told CBS News that intelligence officers working for the Chinese government are trolling professional networking sites, including LinkedIn, to seduce an array of American service members and others who hold U.S. government security clearances into turning over sensitive information. \"On professional networking sites, members of the military, former members of the military, list their résumés,\" Vorndran said. \"It exposes their expertise. And through that, it makes targeting by an intelligence service simple to accomplish.\" A LinkedIn spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether Chinese intelligence officers were using the platform to identify potential targets, but did say in a statement that fraudulent accounts violate the company's terms of service. \"Our teams use a variety of automated technologies, combined with a team of trained investigation experts and member reporting, to help stop bad actors and to keep experiences on LinkedIn professional,\" the spokesperson said. The tactic is low risk and high reward — a hallmark of the kind of \"virtual espionage\"Chinabegan leaning on when COVID made it more difficult for spies to travel abroad, according to counterintelligence officials. \"The intelligence officer can sit behind their desk back in China and reach out to numerous individuals all at once,\" said Ryan Norris, a special agent with the Navy's Criminal Investigative Service. \"They are reaching out to as many people as possible and hoping to get some response.\" In the last two years, federal law enforcement has identified a dozen such cases and brought charges against four service members recruited by suspected undercover agents of China. Vorndran said given the difficulty in policing this kind of outreach, he's concerned the number could be far higher. \"We investigate everyone we can identify and predicate an investigation on,\" said Vorndran. \"The ones that we don't know are the ones that concern me and keep me up.\" A spokesperson for China's embassy denied knowledge of the Zhao case, and did not address a question about whether its intelligence officers were contacting U.S. servicemembers online and soliciting sensitive information. \"China hopes that the United States will stop hyping up the so-called 'Chinese espionage' risk and stop exaggerating the 'China threat theory,' and inject more stability into Sino-US relations instead of setting up obstacles,\" the embassy spokesperson said in a statement. In August 2023, agents with the FBI and NCIS descended on the Ventura County Naval Base, apprehended Zhao, and took him into a small room for questioning. A video of the interrogation, obtained by CBS News, shows Zhao admitting he sent sensitive military information to an individual he met online. While Zhao said the individual seemed \"fishy,\" it does not appear he knew he was dealing with a Chinese intelligence officer. And while he considered passing along photographs of what he was working on as an easy way to make money, he stopped short of sending any classified information. \"When I tried to cut off the relationship with him, it's already kinda late,\" Zhao said in the interrogation, telling the federal agents he felt \"trapped.\" Following the interrogation, Zhao was arrested. He later pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges, and is currently serving a 27-month federal sentence. Prosecutors determined his actions did not rise to the level of espionage. Still, Norris said he believes Zhao's actions amount to a betrayal. \"He absolutely betrayed his country,\" said Norris, who questioned Zhao during the interrogation. \"I think over the past two years he'd had a relationship that he knew was nefarious, and I think he was finally caught in what he was doing.\" Tarek Shawky, Zhao's attorney, said his client was also to some degree a victim of a scam. He said their social media conversations revealed the Chinese intelligence officer sought to build up a level of trust before asking for sensitive information. \"At a certain point, I think the human condition is that you want to suspend a little bit of your better judgment because of that human connection,\" Shawky said. \"That's what makes it so dangerous.\" In an interview with CBS News, Zhao's wife Jianyu Ren said her husband acknowledged making a mistake, but she denied he would ever willfully sell out his country. \"That's not him,\" Ren said. \"If he had known this person was working for the Chinese government or anybody in China, he wouldn't have done that.\" Pat Miltoncontributed to this report.

Republican senators have been working to get the president's team in place as quickly as possible since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and GOP majorities in the House and Senate are eager to get to work on his policy agenda. Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, and nominations require a simple majority, meaning most of Mr. Trump's picks should be comfortably confirmed. Others could face an uphill battle if only a handful of GOP senators oppose their nominations. Here's the hearing schedule, in order of appearance: Pete Hegseth, Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary, appeared before theSenate Armed ServicesCommittee on Tuesday, Jan. 14, in what was likely to be the mostcontentious hearingon the schedule. The 44-year-old former Fox News host and Army combat veteran faced scrutiny over asexual assault allegationthat he denied, along with controversial comments he's made aboutwomen in combat roles. He also faced questions about his qualifications to lead the largest workforce in the country at the Defense Department. Hegseth was confirmed on Jan. 24 by a 51-50 margin, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote after three Republican senators defected: Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. It is the slimmest margin to confirm a Defense Secretary in history. Read CBS News' coverage of Hegseth's hearing here. Mr. Trump's pick for attorney general,Pam Bondi, appeared before theSenate Judiciary Committeeon Wednesday, Jan. 15, and is scheduled to return on Thursday at 10:15 a.m. Bondi, 59, served as Florida's attorney general before going on to work at the right-wing think tank America First Policy Institute. Bondi was tapped for the role after Mr. Trump's first pick for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew following intense criticism. Read CBS News' coverage of Bondi's confirmation hearing here. Sen. Marco Rubio, Mr. Trump's pick for secretary of state, appeared before theSenate Foreign RelationsCommittee on Wednesday, Jan. 15. The 53-year-old has represented Florida in the Senate since 2011 and faced off with Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.

Hassanbunhussein Abolore Lawal, 24, allegedly posed as a young woman on social media and got 17-year-old Gavin Guffey to send him \"compromising photos,\" the Justice Department said. Lawal then allegedly threatened to ruin Guffey's reputation by leaking the photos unless he sent Lawal money, the Justice Department said. Guffey, the son of South Carolina state Rep. Brandon Guffey, died by suicide in 2022. Lawal was indicted in October 2023 on charges of child exploitation resulting in death, distribution of child pornography, coercion and enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity, cyberstalking resulting in death and attempted extortion. \"We will not allow predators who target our children to hide behind a keyboard or across the ocean. Today we honor Gavin's life and continue our fight against sextortion by holding this defendant accountable,\" U.S. Attorney Adair Ford Boroughs for the District of South Carolina said in astatement. Lawal faces up to life in prison and mandatory restitution, where the court may order him to pay for losses incurred by the family due to his scheme. After Guffey's death, Brandon Guffey sponsored a bill known asGavin's Law, which made sexual extortion \"a felony offense and an aggravated felony if the victim is a minor, vulnerable adult, or if the victim suffers bodily injury or death directly related to the crime.\" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMastersigned the billinto law in August 2023. Social media giant Metawarned in Julythat sexual extortion scams are on the rise, with criminals from Nigeria frequently targeting adult men in the U.S. Meta said it had removed about 63,000 accounts from Nigeria that had been attempting to target people with financial sextortion scams.

The tech titans, some of whom are among the richest men in the world and directeddonations from their companiesto Mr. Trump's inauguration, were seated in some of the most highly sought after seats in the Capitol Rotunda. Vance noted that the tech CEOs \"didn't have as good of seating as my mom and a lot of other people who were there to support us.\" In an August interview on \"Face the Nation\", the vice president outlined his thinking on big tech, saying that companies like Google are too powerful and censor American information, while possessing a \"monopoly over free speech\" that he argued ought to be broken up. The tech sphere went on to play an outsized role in Trump's 2024 election victory, with Muskspendingmore than a quarter of a billion dollars to back Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates. Musk became a key ally to the president and in November, Mr. Trump tapped the Tesla CEO to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, a new temporary agency aimed at reducing wasteful federal spending. Meanwhile, other tech CEOs cozied up to the president withvisits to Mar-a-Lagoahead of the inauguration. But Vance said in Saturday's interview that big tech and the tech giants, despite their recent closeness to the president, are \"very much on notice.\" Kaia Hubbard is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByRobert Legare,Jacob Rosen Updated on:  January 27, 2025 / 8:40 PM EST/ CBS News About a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for former special counselJack Smithon the investigation and prosecution of President Trump are being fired, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions via a letter sent over email after Justice Department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda. \"Acting Attorney General James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official told CBS News. Smithwas appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 and took over two ongoing investigations of the president, one related to his handling of classified records and the other tied to his conduct following the 2020 presidential election. Both cases were dismissed after Mr. Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Smith informed the judges overseeing the cases that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. Throughout his probes, the former special counsel amassed a staff of prosecutors and agents to conduct grand jury investigations and try the cases in court. It is not immediately clear which members of Smith's team were fired, but the move makes good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house in the Justice Department. Last week, the president signedan executive orderto take on the \"weaponization of the federal government,\" a characterization he applied to Smith's prosecutions. Fox Newswas first to report on the firings. The news of the firings came on the same day that Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor launched an internal review of the charging decisions behind hundreds ofJan. 6, 2021, Capitol riotcases. Two people familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News that Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin ordered prosecutors in his office to turn in documents, emails and other information related to the previous administration's decision to bring an obstruction charge against more than 200 Capitol attack defendants. The cases at issue are those in which defendants were charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge that the Supreme Court later ruled was too broadly applied by federal prosecutors. Throughout the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation that abruptly came to an end last week after President Trump pardoned more than 1,500 individuals, defendants and their attorneys brought challenges against the obstruction case on multiple fronts as they contested the Justice Department's application of the law in the Capitol riot cases. The Supreme Court ultimately limited prosecutors' use of the statute. The new review is set to examine the decision making behind the use of that charge, the people said. News of the review was first reported by theWall Street Journal. The U.S. attorney's office did not respond to a request for comment. Smith — who resigned from his position following the completion of his investigation —  wrote in hisreporton the probe that his team had collected evidence \"sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,\" if the case involving Mr. Trump's alleged conduct around the 2020 election had gone to trial. Only the first volume of Smith's report, which described the investigation into Mr. Trump's post-2020 election conduct, was released to the public. The second volume is currently shielded from public view while an appeal in the classified documents case is ongoing. In the report, Smith defended his work as apolitical. And in a letter accompanying the final draft, he wrote, \"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable.\" Mr. Trump called Smith \"desperate\" and \"deranged\" and consistently denied wrongdoing throughout the investigations. Also on Monday, the chief of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section resigned from his position after being reassigned, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The official was appointed to the position during the first Trump administration, and his political corruption unit later advised Smith on various aspects of cases against Mr. Trump, according to court documents. NBC Newsfirst reported the resignation. The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. Last week, numerous career Justice Department officials who held high-profile positions were reassigned. The officials affected included senior criminal and national security leaders within two of the department's most critical sections, two sources told CBS News at the time. The career officials have handled numerous high-profile investigations across administrations.

Williams on Monday was answering questions at the International Space Station from students at Needham High School, where she graduated from in 1983. One student asked her what microgravity feels like in space, and she answered that it felt like she was swimming or flying. \"I've been up here long enough right now I've been trying to remember what it's like to walk. I haven't walked. I haven't sat down. I haven't laid down. You don't have to. You can just close your eyes and float where you are right here,\" Williams said. She said that she and astronaut Butch Wilmoreexpected their trip to be longer than eight dayssince it was the first time they were flying the aircraft but did not expect it to be delayed that long. \"It was a little bit of a shock, actually,\" Williams explained to students. \"We knew that it would be probably a month or so, honestly. But the extended stay was just a little bit different.\" Williams said she is having fun in space and is glad she can share the experience with everyone back on Earth. She explained that it has changed her relationship with her family. \"My mother's getting a little bit older, so in that regard, I just try to stay in touch with them and those guys as much as possible,\" Williams said. \"I think I talk to my mom practically every day. Just check in with her and call her and see how she's doing. So it's just a little bit different relationship than we had potentially planned on for the last couple of months. But we're managing.\" She said that she doesn't necessarily feel isolated in space because of her busy schedule and her ability to talk to people at home. The Needham native has been stuck in space with Wilmore for the last seven months after problems with the Starliner concerned NASA and prompted them to keep them up there longer. Their trip was meant to last eight to 10 days originally but has since been delayed multiple times. A SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon went into space with the intention of bringing the astronauts down in February. However, their replacements are aboard a different aircraft, SpaceX Crew-10, which is not expected to launch into space untillate March or April.That means they are not able to return to space until they complete a handover period.

In a 68 to 29 vote, the Senate confirmed Bessent, the first Senate-confirmed openly gay Cabinet member of a Republican administration. Bessent, 62, is the founder of Connecticut-based hedge fund Key Square Group.The incoming treasury secretary appeared before theSenate Finance Committeeearlier this month, which advanced his nomination on a bipartisan basis. The nominee for treasury secretary appeared before theSenate Finance Committeeearlier this month, which advanced Bessent's nomination on a bipartisan basis last week. \"Mr. Bessent has decades of academic, professional and leadership experience relevant to this position, as well as the gravitas, demeanor and character to be an effective secretary,\" Sen. Mike Crapo, the finance committee's chairman, said ahead of the vote to advance Bessent's nomination out of committee. \"There is no doubt that Mr. Bessent is an excellent choice for secretary of the treasury.\" Bessent outlined in his opening statement to the committee that he was born and raised in South Carolina's lowcountry, where he said his family struggled financially, and he first began working at the age of nine. He went on to attend Yale University and started working in finance. He and his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, have two children. \"My life has been the only-in-America story that I am determined to preserve for future generations,\" Bessent said. Bessent said his work in the private sector has given him a \"deep understanding\" of the economy and markets, which he said will be invaluable in crafting economic policy. But he acknowledged that he has never served in government and intends to lean on others for counsel. The billionaire, a former executive with Soros Fund Management, provided economic advice to the Trump campaign and has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump's policies in recent years — from tariffs to spending cuts. Bessent said during the committee hearing that he believes the president has a \"generational opportunity to unleash a new economic golden age that will create more jobs, wealth and prosperity for all Americans.\" \"Today, Americans face significant challenges in an economy that has not created enough opportunities for working men and women,\" Bessent said, pointing to an affordability crisis and housing shortage. He said the federal government has a \"significant spending problem,\" adding that \"we must work to get our fiscal house in order\" and adjust discretionary spending. As treasury secretary, Bessent would oversee the department that manages the nation's finances, as well as the IRS, the nation's tax agency. Among his priorities, Bessent called the extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, some of which are set to expire at year's end, the \"single most important economic issue of the day.\" If the tax cuts aren't extended, Bessent warned, the nation would face \"economic calamity.\" Bessent's confirmation vote comes as the Senate has since Mr. Trump took office last week  confirmed a handful of his Cabinet and top administration picks, includingSecretary of State Marco Rubio,CIA Director John Ratcliffe,Defense Secretary Pete HegsethandHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. This week, the upper chamber is expected to push forward with a handful of other confirmation votes, while some of the most controversial nominees —Tulsi Gabbardfor director of national intelligence,Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services andKash Patelfor FBI director — come before Senate committees for confirmation hearings.

        "content": "Watch CBS News ByKaia Hubbard Updated on:  January 26, 2025 / 11:46 AM EST/ CBS News Washington —Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's effort to endbirthright citizenshipSaturday,arguing in his first interviewsince taking office that \"just because we were founded by immigrants, doesn't mean that 240 years later that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world.\" \"America should actually look out for the interests of our citizens first,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"If you're here permanently and lawfully, your kid becomes an American citizen.\" Mr. Trump'sexecutive ordertargeting birthright citizenship directs federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to children born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally or under temporary visas, and came among a wave of executive actions he signed shortly after returning to office last week. The U.S. government has long interpreted the Constitution to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution says \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" But Trump has for years touted the idea of ending birthright citizenship, arguing that it encourages illegal immigration. The move has prompted a growing number of legal challenges in recent days. And a federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan temporarilyblocked the orderThursday, calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional.\" Vance said he disagrees, noting that the issue will be litigated, which he said is \"the nature of our constitutional system.\" Vance explained that the \"basic idea\" behind the move is that lawful permanent residents or the children of a legal immigrant who plans to stay in the U.S. \"should become American citizens.\" But he said anyone who doesn't plan to stay and gives birth in the U.S. shouldn't become a citizen \"by virtue of just having been born on American soil.\" Vance cited the example of a \"child of an ambassador\" who would not automatically receive American citizenship. Brennan pointed out, \"there's already a carveout having to do with kids of diplomats.\" Vance replied, \"We're saying that that carve out should apply to anybody who doesn't plan to stay here.\" He continued, \"If you come here on vacation and you have a baby in an American hospital, that baby doesn't become an American citizen. If you're an illegal alien and you come here temporarily, hopefully, your child does not become an American citizen by virtue of just having been born on American soil. It's a very basic principle in American immigration law, that if you want to become an American citizen, and you've done it the right way, and the American people in their collective wisdom have welcomed you into our national community, then you become a citizen.\" \"This is a country founded by immigrants,\" Brennan replied. \"This is a unique country.\" \"This is a very unique country,\" said Vance, \"and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers.\" Vance claimed he didn't know of \"any country\" that allows the children of people in a country on a temporary basis to become citizens, saying he doesn't know why the U.S. \"would be different.\" More than 30 countries have birthright citizenship or similar policies, according to the Central Intelligence Agency'sWorld Factbook.

One man exclusively told CBS News Miami his wife was taken during one of these raids. TheHomeland Security Investigation's (HSI) Miami officeshared on X that federal law enforcement agencies conducted several immigration enforcement operations on Sunday. Meanwhile, agents fromICE's Miami officereported detaining some undocumented migrants on various offenses across South Florida, including in Broward and Martin counties. One man, who did not want to be named, told CBS News Miami that ICE had taken his wife during one of these raids in the Miami neighborhood of Brownsville. \"It's despicable what they're doing right now,\" he said. \"It's very embarrassing.\" The man told CBS News Miami that he wanted Mr. Trump to let his wife stay in the U.S., as their 11th anniversary is on Friday. When asked if she was in the process of getting her U.S. citizenship, the man told CBS News Miami that she was right in the middle of it. The man's wife, who's Venezuelan and has lived in the U.S. for a few years, had a court date set up and \"everything was good\" until that moment. \"They just came and they snatched her,\" the man told CBS News Miami. The man's wife was one of three people taken in the Brownsville raid. The other two were men who reportedly worked in construction.

The man told CBS News Miami his message to the president: \"If I get a chance to talk to you, man —   please, man —   let's work something out. Let me keep my wife here in the United States. She deserves to be here.\" ICE reported it detained nearly 1,000 people across the country on Sunday alone, which is up from just under 300 detentions the day before.

The incident happened just days after he waspardoned by President Trumpfor a misdemeanor related to the2021 U.S. Capitol riot. Around 4:15 p.m., a Jasper County Sheriff's deputy conducted a traffic stop near the Pulaski County line on S.R. 14. According to ISP, the officer attempted to arrest the suspect, but authorities say the suspect resisted and an altercation took place. \"An altercation took place between the suspect and the officer, which resulted in the officer firing his weapon and fatally wounding the suspect,\" ISP said in a written release. Police said during the traffic stop, the suspect was in possession of a firearm. The Jasper County Coroner identified the person killed as Matthew Huttle, 42, of Hobart, Indiana. \"Our condolences go out to the family of the deceased as any loss of life is traumatic to those that were close to Mr. Huttle,\" Sheriff Patrick Williamson said. An investigation is ongoing. The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative leave per standard protocol, according to ISP. Authorities didn't say what might have prompted the traffic stop. In 2023, Huttle was sentenced to six months in custody after pleading guilty to entering a restricted building. He had traveled with his uncle to Washington to attend the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump rally, and they both entered the Capitol. Huttle was inside for 16 minutes and recorded it on video. \"He is not a true believer in any political cause,\" defense attorney Andrew Hemmer said in a court filing. \"He instead went to the rally because he thought it would be a historic moment and he had nothing better to do after getting out of jail\" for a driving offense.

        "title": "Trump expected to sign executive orders to reshape the military, including banning transgender troops",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Follow: President Donald Trump on Monday is expected to sign four executive orders that would reshape the military, including banning transgender service members from serving in the US armed forces, gutting the military’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs, and reinstating with back pay service members who were discharged forrefusing to get vaccinated from Covid-19, two White House officials told CNN. The orders, which were first reported by theNew York Post, come as Trump’s nominee to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, was sworn in as secretary of defense on Saturday. Hegseth has long stated he planned to implement major cultural changes to the military, including ending DEI practices and removing “woke” service members. Moments after his arrival at the Pentagon on Monday, Hegseth told reporters that there are “more executive orders coming.” “Today, there are more executive orders coming, … on removing DEI inside the Pentagon, reinstating troops who were pushed out because of Covid mandates, iron dome for America — this is happening quickly, and as the secretary of defense, it’s an honor to salute smartly as I did as a junior officer and now as the secretary of defense to ensure these orders are complied with rapidly and quickly,” Hegseth said. Trump hadbannedtransgender Americans form serving in the military in 2017 during his first administration, but then-President Joe Biden issued an order in 2021 repealing the ban. Hours after being sworn in for his second term last week, Trump signed an order revoking the Biden administration’s 2021 move to allow transgender members to serve. However, the order Trump is expected to sign on Monday goes even further, one of the officials said, and will outline new military standards regarding gender pronouns and state that mental and physical readiness requires transgender service members be banned from the military. “It can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery, which often involves the use of heavy narcotics. During this period, they are not physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements,” one of the officials said, citing a fact sheet. “The implementation [of the ban] is on the DoD regarding specifics,” the official said. In 2018, there were an estimated 14,000 transgender service members in the US military, according to thePalm Center, an independent research institute that has conducted extensive research on sexual minorities in the military. APentagon memodetailing the ban during Trump’s first term in office recommended making exceptions for transgender service members already serving in uniform who had joined the military under previous policies before the ban took effect; those who do not require a change in gender; and those who had been “stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to accession.” It’s unclear whether the administration’s new ban will also have exceptions. Asked about possible exceptions on Monday, Hegseth said only that there will be an executive order “on that right now, today.” A second EO states that any “discriminatory” policies related to DEI in the military will be banned. The order comes after the Trump administrationorderedemployees in any federal diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility offices to be placed on paid administrative leave “effective immediately.” All DEI practices in the US armed forces will also be subject to an internal review by Hegseth. The third executive order directs Hegseth to reinstate all active and reserve service members who were previously discharged for failing to get the Covid-19 vaccine. They will be reinstated with their former rank and given back pay and benefits, one of the officials said. However, the Pentagon had already rescinded the military’sCovid-19 vaccination mandate, allowing them to rejoin after Biden signed the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act requiring the change. As of Monday, 113 of the more than 8,000 US service members who were discharged from the military for refusing to be vaccinated have sought to since the vaccine mandate was officially repealed. And a fourth order would begin the process of creating a “next generation” missile defense shield for the US, according to a fact sheet on the order obtained by CNN. The order calls for an “Iron Dome” for an America, borrowing the name of the vaunted short-rangeIsraeli missile defense systemthat for years has been used to intercept launches from Gaza. The US provided billions of dollars in funding to Iron Dome, and the US Army has its own system. “The Executive Order directs implementation of a next generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next generation aerial attacks,” the fact sheet reads, calling such potential attacks as a “catastrophic threat,” though none of these types of weapons has been launched against the territory of the United States in modern warfare. The US military also has the capability to deploy a layered air defense system, from long-range Patriot missiles, which have proven effective at intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles over Ukraine, to shorter-range systems like shoulder-launched Stinger missiles. This new executive order calls for an advanced space-based series of systems to detect and shoot down launches against the United States. It does not say how much the shield would cost or outline a timeline for its development. CNN’s Michael Williams contributed to this report.

        "title": "Key GOP senators want public commitments from RFK Jr. on abortion and vaccines during confirmation hearings",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Follow: Some GOP senators want public commitments from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before deciding whether to support him as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, signaling that President Donald Trump’s pick will have to win over uncertain Republicans in order to secure the job. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who is anti-abortion rights, told CNN that Kennedy needs to do more to assuage her concerns given his past comments supporting access to the procedure. “He will need to publicly state his position on abortion because I’m obviously very life focused. That’s one of the biggest concerns,” Ernst told CNN. Republican senators and anti-abortion advocates have alreadysounded the alarmon Kennedy’s stance on this issue, his previous Democratic bid for president and his past support for abortion access until fetal viability, which Trump’s team has seen as a key vulnerability. It’s not the only issue that Republican senators will be pressing Kennedy on during a pair of high-profile confirmation hearings this week. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who was one of three Republicans to vote against Trump’s Department of Defense nominee last week, said Monday that she still has concerns about Kennedy, given his long history of sowing doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. “Well I’m certainly concerned about it. I know others have other, other points of concerns that they want to drill down on and try to get some commitments, public commitments, from him on,” Murkowski said. “But vaccines are important.” Kennedy hastriedto tamp down concerns about his history of vaccine skepticism, including whether he supports the polio vaccine. He told reporters on Capitol Hill in December that he is “all for” the polio vaccine followingreports that a lawyer affiliated with Kennedyhas petitioned the US Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the polio vaccine used in the United States. Over the last month, Kennedy has met with senators on both sides of the aisle as he has tried to make his case directly to them behind closed doors. But the public comments from Republican senators on Monday suggest he has more work to do. Ernst also told CNN she believes Kennedy needs to clarifyhis positiononclimate change. “But then also the climate, his view on climate and his ideology, I want to make sure that that’s not playing a role there either,” she said. Other key senators were noncommittal Monday night when asked for their position on Kennedy. Republican Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chair Bill Cassidy of Louisiana referred all questions about Kennedy to his office, while GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voted against Pete Hegseth’s Pentagon nomination, did not divulge where she stands. On vaccines, Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said, “I can tell you that (Kennedy is) very clear.” “He serves at the will of the president of the United States, but he also thinks that there’s nothing wrong with questioning science,” Mullin, who has backed Kennedy, said. Kennedy will face senators’ questioning just days after Hegseth onlynarrowlyearned Senate confirmation as the Trump administration tries to stand up the president’s Cabinet as quickly as possible. Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana outlined the stakes Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will face in the hearings. “I expect him to address all of these issues head-on and tell us, tell the committee, and, more importantly, the American people in front of God and country, what his position is on vaccines,” the senator said. “I’ve read a bunch of different positions, and I’ve learned not to believe everything I see on the internet. So that’s why the confirmation hearing is going to be important.” While Democrats have at times agreed with some of Kennedy’s stances, such as his positions on food safety, suggesting there could be some crossover votes to offset any Republican opposition, most Democrats are against the nomination given his vaccine skepticism. “I’ve met with him and that’s part of an ongoing dialogue,” Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania told CNN when asked if he might support Kennedy. Despite the percolating concerns, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN Monday that Kennedy has effectively given reassurances to Republican senators skeptical of his view on vaccines and other controversial issues and has a path to be confirmed even though it’s not clear yet how a handful of them will vote. “He’ll have that opportunity in front of the world this week,” said Thune. “I think in his private meeting he’s given a lot of reassurances, at least in the readouts that I’m getting from those meetings. And that was my experience in the one I had with him.” Pressed on whether Kennedy can get enough votes to be confirmed with Republicans’ slim margin in the Senate, Thune said: “As I’ve said before with all these nominees, there’s a path, but I reserve judgment until after they go through the hearing process. My job is to make sure they get that process. But, yeah, I think there’s a way for him to get there.” Still, Republican senators are aware there is little room for error once a nominee reaches the Senate floor. “My position is that the president is entitled to his team absent some extraordinary circumstances. But I’m just one vote,” said Texas Sen. John Cornyn. “And as we’ve seen with the Hegseth nomination, there’s not a lot of cushion. And so, I think the hearing will be very important to either satisfy people that he’s should be confirmed or not.” CNN’s Ted Barrett, Alison Main, Kit Maher and Haley Talbot contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "content": "Follow: Editor’s note:Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. If you have resolved to start a regular exercise regimen this year — congrats! But does that mean you need to buy pricey fitness apparel? While exercise-specific clothing can be a worthwhile investment, it’s not necessarily a requirement, experts say. “If you’re exercising purely for fun or to be more active, it’s not the most important thing to go out and buy specific clothing,” said Dr. Joel Hardwick, a clinical exercise physiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. “You just want to meet the minimum criteria with your clothing — that it’s not too tight, not too loose and that it feels comfortable.” Related articleWhy you should keep exercising in cold weather Comfort is key, agreed Kaylee Johnson, a lead performance coach with fitness app Future who’s based in Lafayette, Colorado. “If buying specific clothing would be a barrier to going to the gym, just wear whatever’s comfortable,” Johnson said. “It doesn’t have to be perfect.” Yet you do need to be mindful about which clothing you’re grabbing from the closet, especially if you’ll be exercising outdoors. “It’s more important to think about clothing for the climate and other weather considerations, such as rain,” Hardwick said. In general, avoid cotton clothing if you’ll be outdoors. When you sweat, cotton clothes absorb moisture and hold it against your skin. This can be a problem since damp clothing can cause overheating when it’s hot outside and put you at risk of hypothermia and frostbite when it’s cold, according to theInternational Sports Sciences Association. Synthetics are a better option, as they allow air to circulate and wick away moisture. In cold weather, layers are key, Johnson said. You can remove them as you warm up and put them back on when you cool down. Shoes are also an important consideration, whether exercising indoors or outside. Ideally, you should select a shoe specific to your chosen activity (running, basketball, tennis, and so on). But an all-purpose sports shoe can work, too. “As long as your shoes are broken in, not too worn, not too tight or loose, and allow space for toe movement, it’s generally fine,” Hardwick said. Related articleHate running, or even the idea of running? Me too, until I started hacking it Good, supportive shoes are key, Johnson added, although there are some exceptions, namely when it comes to strength training. “Wearing running shoes to strength train is bad, because they have so much cushion,” Johnson said. “You want flat-soled shoes for stability.” If you elect to run, however, opt for running shoes. Proper running shoes can prevent injuries and improve performance, according to a 2024 review published in theJournal of the Foot & Ankle. Once you have found a form of exercise you enjoy, consider investing in at least one complete fitness outfit, Johnson advised. Doing so can improve performance, comfort and even confidence. “I’ve had clients come in with baggy sweats, which got in their way when running,” Johnson said. “Once they switched to formfitting  leggings, it changed everything. They were cooler and more comfy.” The same holds for baggy T-shirts if your favorite activity requires arm movement, such as playing tennis or pickleball. Opt for more fitted shirts, Johnson said, and you’ll likely be happier. Related articleWhy you should take a week off from working out, according to science Quality sports bras are important, too, especially for bustier women engaging in high-impact sports. Better support equals more comfort. A high-impact sports bra can also improve performance. Female runners who had greater breast support used less oxygen and improved their running economy, according to one2022 studyin the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living. But some experts urge caution regarding sportswear containinghigh levels of bisphenol A, a synthetic chemical found in socks, sports bras and athletic shirts. BPA is a hormone-disrupting chemical that can be absorbed through the skin and cause developmental and reproductive harm, according to theCenter for Environmental Health, a consumer watchdog group. The center urges people to limit their exposure to BPA by removing sportswear and socks immediately after workouts and avoiding clothing made from polyester with spandex, among other protective measures. Related articleForget crunches: The smarter way to strengthen your core In the end, your choice of clothing will likely come down to how invested you become in your chosen exercise. If you really get into running, for example, higher-end running shoes can boost your performance by improving your running economy,  Hardwick said. An improved running economy means you will use less energy while running at your typical pace. If cycling’s your thing, investing in padded cycling shorts and formfitted shirts will make your rides more enjoyable, Johnson noted. “But if this clothing is a barrier for you budget-wise, don’t worry about it,” she said. Hardwick agreed. “More expensive does not mean better,” he said. “As long as you’re feeling comfortable and confident, then your clothing is doing its job.” Melanie Radzicki McManusis a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness. © 2025 Cable News Network.

But instead of taxiing to International Arrivals, the plane headed towards the military side of the airport as fighter jets screamed above, weaving around in training exercises. When the aircraft doors opened, dozens of men and women were ushered onto the tarmac where they were greeted by an emotional Guatemalan Vice President Karin Herrera and other officials and then led into a reception center for returnees. “Good morning!” one shouted. “How are you,paisanos(countrymen)?” This was a chartered deportation flight from the United States, an operation that’s gained new attention since the inauguration of President Donald Trump last week and his promises to remove millions of undocumented migrants. If there was any shame or animosity when the flight left Alexandria, Louisiana, just before sunrise, none of that was evident when the migrants walked back on Guatemalan soil, many shuffling in open sneakers — the laces having been taken by US authorities in a common safety practice, and never returned. The passengers – all adults on this flight – were welcomed with cookies and coffee and efficient processing in the migrant reception center. Repatriation flights have been an ongoing process, Herrera told CNN, adding there had been no increase since Trump came to power. The only difference, she said, was the use of military planes such as the one arriving later on Monday. She did not want to discussthe weekend spat between Colombia and the USover the use of military planes, saying her focus was on her citizens. “We are committed to their integrity and their basic rights,” Herrera said. Related videoSee the process deported migrants go through after landing in Guatemala Some of the returning Guatemalans had lived and worked in the US for years. Some were fluent in English. But they had all entered without permission or documents and so were subject to deportation. The migrants left the US as criminals, telling us they were handcuffed on board until they were out of US airspace on their flight south. But whether they were looking forward to being back on home turf or not, the official reception they got was mostly very warm, as if they had been badly missed. A few did remain in handcuffs and were escorted by police, expected to face action for crimes alleged to have been committed in their homeland. But for the majority, they sat with snacks as names were called and temporary identification papers were handed out. “Undocumented” no more. They might have skills and abilities that could find them work and a good life back in their home country, benefiting themselves and Guatemala too, officials said. The returning migrants applauded Herrera after she gave a short speech in the arrival hall but each has their own view on whether they will heed calls to stay. Sara Tot-Botoz had lived for 10 years in Alabama, working in construction, roofing and car repair, as well as caring for two of her children, now adults, and grandchildren. She said she had been driving away from a Walmart with one of those grandchildren about seven months ago when she says police pulled her over and cited her for not having him in a car seat. After her immigration status was discovered, she spent two months in jail in Alabama and then five months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention in Louisiana, she said. Once processed back into Guatemala, she said her first thought was to get out of the shapeless gray sweats she was wearing and into her indigenous clothes. And then to eat some good food. Tot-Botoz, 43, stood waiting for her belongings. Only a handful of the migrants had suitcases for their things. Most others waited for a large plastic sack to be handed over containing all that they had taken from the US. As others charged their phones at free power banks to call friends or relatives, Tot-Botoz changed and hurried out onto the street outside. There was another of her children, a daughter, now 25, who had not seen her mother since she was 15. The two women hugged each other for a long time, each crying. They had not been in contact since Tot-Botoz was taken to detention and while there was much to catch up on, for a few minutes they just wanted to hold each other. “It feels dangerous in the US now,” Tot-Botoz told CNN, explaining that undocumented migrants could be picked up anywhere. Tot-Botoz told CNN for now she wants to get back to her indigenous community, about a five-hour drive away, and never leave. But Fidel Ambrocio said he still saw his future in the US. He said he had lived there for a total of 19 years, first arriving as a teen and voluntarily leaving for a spell in 2018 before heading back north. He has a wife, a four-year-old daughter and a baby son, born just a couple of months before he was detained, he said, on an old warrant for trespass at the home of his ex-wife’s mother. Ambrocio, 35, who’d worked in construction in Montgomery, Alabama, seemed almost stunned to be back in Guatemala. He was also angry, not comprehending why he was deported when most of the rhetoric from Trump and his team has been about sending violent offenders out of the country. “We’re not criminals,” he insisted, saying he did not consider his offence to be a serious crime. The migrants CNN spoke to had all been detained while Joe Biden was president, and went through removal proceedings that led to them being on the flight from Louisiana. Ambrocio told CNN he would try to go back to the US. Legally, he said, he has to wait 10 years before applying for a visa, but he said he might try in two or four years, even if that meant travelling illegally and facing whatever the consequences might be. “If I can never go back, I will try to get my wife and kids here,” he conceded. “That will be very challenging.” CNN’s Michael Rios contributed to this story. © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "content": "Follow: Staff at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been ordered to stop communicating with the World Health Organization, according to a new memo, dealing a significant blow to global health efforts. The directive was made in accordance with President Donald Trump’s January 20executive orderwithdrawing the US from WHO, according to a memo sent late Sunday from CDC Deputy Director of Global Health Dr. John Nkengasong to senior agency leadership, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. It was first reported by the Associated Press. Related articleTrump announces US withdrawal from World Health Organization “Effective immediately all CDC staff engaging with WHO through technical working groups, coordinating centers, advisory boards, cooperative agreements or other means – in person or virtual – must cease their activity and await further guidance,” the memo says. The US is one of the largest funders of WHO, and federal law requires one year of notice before US support for the organization can be withdrawn. Trump’s order claims that legal notice of withdrawal was given during his first term, in 2020, so the withdrawal can happen immediately. The White House, the CDC, WHO and the US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment. “This move is reckless, basically ordering CDC not to work with WHO to put out fires is going to make Americans far more vulnerable,” Dr. Lawrence Gostin, a global health expert at Georgetown University who runs a WHO coordinating center on national and global health law, told CNN. With outbreaks of lethal Marburg virus and H5N1 bird flu spreading in animals around the world, he said, a lack of international coordination on public health is dangerous. Gostin said he was also told that Trump has recalled all CDC staff who are seconded to WHO offices in other countries, a move spelled out in Trump’s January 20 order. The CDC has staff in a network of international offices in more than 60 countries. These offices can help provide early warning when there are infectious disease outbreaks of concern. Gostin said that if Trump is trying to negotiate a better deal with WHO, there are better ways to go about it. “President Trump is asking CDC to hit the pause button. But the truth is that viruses don’t take a break from circulating while the White House figures out its next move,” he said. “If you want to figure out what your future relationship is with WHO, you stay in the fight until you figured it out, and then you make your move. You don’t just quit the battle while you’re trying to figure something out, because the enemy – which is the virus – is still circulating and causing mayhem.” © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "title": "Trump fires DOJ officials who prosecuted himShow all",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Follow: More than a dozen officials who worked on the criminal investigations into Donald Trump have been fired, according to sources familiar with the matter. A letter from acting Attorney General James McHenry to the officials said they cannot be “trusted” to “faithfully” implement Trump’s agenda. “You played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump. The proper functioning of government critically depends on the trust superior officials place in their subordinates,” McHenry wrote. “Given your significant role in prosecuting the President, I do not believe that the leadership of the Department can trust you to assist in implementing the President’s agenda faithfully.” The firings come as the the Trump administration is taking concrete steps to investigate prosecutors who oversaw the criminal cases against January 6 defendants after Trump vowed to seek retribution as a key pledge of his campaign, according to multiple sources who have seen an internal memo on the matter. Ed Martin, the interim US attorney in Washington, DC, has launched an investigation into prosecutors who brought obstruction charges underUS Code 1512(c) against some rioters that were ultimately tossed because of a Supreme Court decision last summer. Related articleTrump pardoned the January 6 convicts. Now his DOJ is wiping evidence of rioters’ crimes from the internet Referring to the effort as a “special project,” Martin wrote in the memo issued Monday that the attorneys should hand over “all information you have related to the use of 1512 charges, including all files, documents, notes, emails, and other information” to two of the office’s long-term prosecutors who must submit a report on the probe by Friday. “Obviously the use was a great failure of our office – s. ct. decision – and we need to get to the bottom of it,” the memo reads, referencing theJune Supreme Court ruling that limited the power of federal prosecutorsto pursue obstruction charges against the January 6 rioters. The demand for documents also extends to prosecutors who have since left the US attorney’s office. The move comes as the Justice Department has already seen a dramatic shakeup as officials connected to high-profile investigations have been reassigned, including the now-dismissed case against Trump himself for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases told CNN that the memo raises concerns that Trump’s DOJ is beginning to “investigate the investigators,” as he’s long threatened. One person who worked on Capitol riot cases told CNN that prosecutors don’t know whether this investigation is looking to bring criminal or civil charges, and that some are starting to hire their own lawyers for their defense. A senior administration official familiar with the Martin email describes this as a “fact-finding” mission, noting a “huge waste of resources.“ “The prior office screwed up by filing hundreds of cases that ended upgetting thrown out by the Supreme Court, it is worth getting to the bottom of poor decision making,” the person said. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. Martin, a hardline, socially conservative activist and commentator who was anwas an organizerwith the “Stop the Steal” movement, was tapped for the role last week. Since starting the job, he has praised Trump for issuing mass pardons for January 6 defendants. He also successfully lobbied a judge to toss out travel restrictions imposed on members of the Oath Keepers after they were released from prison, saying: “If a judge decided that Jim Biden, General Mark Milley, or another individual were forbidden to visit America’s capital — even after receiving a last-minute, preemptive pardon from the former President — I believe most Americans would object. The individuals referenced in our motion have had their sentences commuted – period, end of sentence.” This story has been updated with additional developments. © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "content": "Live Updates • Immigration win for Trump:Donald Trump is expected to signthe Laken Riley Actinto law Wednesday, the White House confirmed. It’s likely to be the first piece of legislation to cross Trump’s desk and marks his first major win. This comes as the administration launched animmigration enforcement blitz nationwideover the weekend that included nearly 1,000 arrests, according to authorities. • New military executive orders:Trumpis expected to sign executive orderstoday that would reshape the military, including banning transgender service members from serving in the US armed forces. On his first day as defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who has long been in favor of these changes,told reporters that he will ensurethese “orders are complied with rapidly and quickly.” Track Trump’slatest executive orders here. • GOP conference:The president isaddressing the House Republican retreatas he tries to  move quickly with his legislative agenda. This comes as more ofTrump’s Cabinet picks— including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services secretary — face high-stakes Senate confirmation hearings this week. President Donald Trump said Monday that he believes Microsoft is in discussion to acquire social media company TikTok, telling reporters traveling with him on Air Force One he hopes to see a bidding war from companies that would allow the Chinese-owned platform to continue operating in the US. “I like bidding wars, because you make your best deal,” Trump said during an in-flight gaggle en route back to Washington. “We have a lot of interest in because it’s very clear-cut. It’s very clear, if I sign, then somebody’s going to buy it, pay a lot of money, have a lot of jobs, keep a platform open and have it be very secure. If I don’t sign, then it closes.”  Hours after his inauguration last week, Trump issuedan executive order delaying the enforcement of a controversial law for 75 days. The law requires that TikTok be banned in the US unless it sells to a buyer from America or one of its allies. The executive action followed a pledge from Trump last weekend that he would delay enforcement. TikTok said that assurance allowed it to come back online after going dark for more than 12 hours. Asked Monday directly if Microsoft was in discussion to acquire the app, Trump said, “I would say yes.” “There’s a lot of interest in TikTok — there’s great interest in TikTok,” he said. CNN has reached out to Microsoft for comment. President Donald Trump elaborated Monday on remarks over the weekend thathe’d like to “clean out” Gaza, saying of the more than 1 million Palestinians living in the enclave, “I’d like to get them living in an area where they can live without disruption and revolution and violence so much.” Over the weekend, the president sparked headlines when he told reporters he’dspoken with the king of Jordanabout potentially building housing and moving Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries,a remarkable proposal from a sitting US president. Approximately 90% of Gaza residents have been displaced, and many have been forced to move repeatedly, some more than 10 times, according to the United Nations. “You know, when you look at the Gaza Strip, it’s been hell for so many years, and it just seems to be this — various civilizations start here, started thousands of years before,” Trump said Monday. “There’s always been violence associated. So, I think you can get people living in areas that are a lot safer and maybe a lot better and maybe a lot more comfortable.”  Trump also said that he’d spoken with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, but declined to say directly if the president had an opinion on taking additional Palestinian refugees. “I’d love to do that — I wish he would take some, we help them a lot, and I’m sure he can help us, he’s a friend of mine,” Trump said. “He’s in a very rough part of the world, to be honest, as they say, it’s a rough neighborhood, but I think he can do it.” Trump also said that he planned to speak “in the not-too distant future” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who he said is “coming here to meet with me.” Pressed when Netanyahu will visit Washington, Trump said, “very soon.” Staff at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been ordered to stop communicating with the World Health Organization (WHO), according to a new memo, dealing a significant blow to global health efforts. The directive was made in accordance with President Donald Trump’s January 20executive orderwithdrawing the US from WHO, according to a memo sent late Sunday from CDC Deputy Director of Global Health Dr. John Nkengasong to senior agency leadership, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. It was first reported by theAssociated Press. “Effective immediately all CDC staff engaging with WHO through technical working groups, coordinating centers, advisory boards, cooperative agreements or other means – in person or virtual – must cease their activity and await further guidance,” the memo says.  The US is one of the largest funders of WHO, and federal law requires one year of notice before US support for the organization can be withdrawn. Trump’s order claims that legal notice of withdrawal was given during his first term, in 2020, so the withdrawal can happen immediately. The White House, the CDC, WHO and the US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Monday reported making 1,179 arrests and lodging 853 detainers. The arrests are part of a broader effort to amass a larger enforcement apparatus by pulling in a range of federal agencies that have been extended immigration authority under the Trump administration. In sweeps that largely started on Sunday in several cities across the nation, ICE reported 956 arrests that day. The numbers are updated daily with the count starting at midnight, according to ICE’s post. ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations conducted 113,431 administrative arrests in the fiscal year that ended October 2024, according toan agency report. That’s about 310 arrests a day, as CNN previously reported. The Trump administration launchedan immigration enforcement blitznationwide over the weekend. It included multiple federal agencies and resulted in the arrest of nearly 1,000 people, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It’s part of President Donald Trump’s push to enact his priorities in his first week in office. Here’s the latest: Jennifer Jimenez, whose cousin was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Newark, New Jersey, last week, said her cousin was not in the US to “create any harm” — he just wanted to provide for his family. While undocumented, Jimenez told CNN on Monday her cousin, David, is a “hard working man” and does not have a criminal record. He has been in the US for about four years, she said. Federal agentsdetained multiple people Thursdayduring what ICE called “a targeted enforcement operation.” Jimenez described agents coming into the business where David worked and asking for his identification before they took him to a detention center. The agents “raided” the local business and detained “undocumented residents as well as citizens, without producing a warrant,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said in a statement at the time. Jimenez said her cousin came to the US to take care of his family and pay medical bills. She said his younger sister, who has since died, was battling cancer and had a young daughter. Now, her cousin is raising that little girl, Jimenez said. “They don’t know the reason that they’re coming here, it’s not for them to create any harm. It’s for them to prosper, to keep their family alive,” Jimenez said.  The new Trump administration is moving to clamp down on immigration. A law enforcement source briefed on the investigation in Newark told CNN the enforcement action was in response to a tip reporting unauthorized workers at a place of business. The Trump administration has placed dozens of the most senior career officials at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) on leave, according to multiple sources. In a stunning move, roughly 60 career officials were notified Monday that they would be placed on immediate leave. Sources said there seemed to have been particular focus on USAID’s general counsel’s office. An internal statement from acting Administrator Jason Gray tied the action to President Donald Trump’srecent executive orderthat immediately suspended almost all foreign assistance. “We have identified several actions within USAID that appeared designed to circumvent the President’s Executive Orders and the mandate from the American people,” Gray said in a message to the USAID workforce, which was seen by CNN. Gray said staffers were being put on leave with full benefits “while we complete our analysis of these actions.” On Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed diplomatic posts worldwide that all foreign aid, with a few exceptions, was immediately on hold, pending further review. CNN has reached out to USAID for comment. Politicofirst reportedon the officials being placed on leave. The Congress is working to conduct confirmation hearings and votes for a slate of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees. The House Oversight Committee also launched a sanctuary cities investigation. Here’s a rundown of what’s happening on the Hill: Fillibuster break:The Senate voted unanimously on Monday night to break a filibuster on Sean Duffy’s nomination to lead the Department of Transportation. A final vote on his confirmation is expected on Tuesday. Duffy has been one of the least controversial of Trump’s nominees and was approved unanimously by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology. Senate Majority Leader John Thune Monday filed procedural motions to break filibusters on the nominations and set up confirmation votes for several other Tump picks: Lee Zeldin for EPA, Doug Burgum for interior, Christopher Wright for energy and Douglas Collins for veteran affairs. About Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s upcoming hearing:Ahead of his hearing to become Health and Human Services Secretary, some Republican senators, like Sen. Lisa Murkowski, said they want him to address concerns about his views on vaccines. Some indicated they haven’t made up their minds yet and others expressed hope that he would get across the finish line. Investigation into sanctuary cities:The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced an investigation into the policies of sanctuary cities Monday and invited the mayors of four sanctuary city jurisdictions to testify before congress next month. House Committee Chair James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, sent letters to the mayors of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City and requested documents and information related to those cities’ policies. CNN has reached out to the offices of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. President Donald Trump reiterated his eagerness to work with Congress to pass “the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history” during remarks at theHouse Republican Members Conference dinner. He also reaffirmed his openness to passing more than one bill to achieve his legislative goals. “We just want, whether it’s one bill, two bills, I don’t care, these guys are going to work it out,” Trump said, urging lawmakers to avoid getting mired in the complexities of the budget process.  His comments underscore his continued emphasis on tax policy as a central priority for his administration’s legislative agenda. A key focus for Trump this year is extending the provisions of his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans — before they are set to expire at the end of 2025. What Trump has said before:Trump had initially advocated for “one big, beautiful bill” to finance his agenda, but he later acknowledged resistance from some Republicans to his ambitious plan and indicated he was open to alternative approaches, as CNN reported. “I would prefer one, but I will do whatever needs to be done to get it passed,” Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt during an appearance on his show. Acting on one of President Donald Trump’s initial executive orders, the Office of Personnel Management sent a memo on Monday to the heads of federal departments and agencies requesting that they identify policy-oriented positions to be recommended to shift to a new category with less job security. Agencies have 90 days to preliminarily review positions and submit petitions to OPM and then have another 120 days to finalize the process, the memo said. The president will issue a new executive order that will effectuate the transfer. The positions include those that have “substantive participation in the advocacy for or development or formulation of policy,” including: They also could affect positions whose duties include: The memo also reiterates that Trump’s executive order supersedes a 2024 Biden administration rule aimed at bolstering protections for civil service workers. Overturning a rule typically does not happen via executive order and involves a longer process. The initial order, one of many targeting the federal workforce, has struck fear into many staffers who spoke to CNN. What moving into the new category could mean:Employees moved into the new category — called Schedule Policy/Career — would be stripped of their civil service protections, making them easier to fire. Trump’s order revived a similar directive from late 2020 that created a category called Schedule F, though it was quickly rescinded by former President Joe Biden. US Secret Service Director Sean Curran is announcing leadership changes, according to a statement obtained by CNN, following other Trump administration agency heads who have reshuffled or in some cases fired top leaders. Agency heads across government are often eager to bring in their own teams. However, sources were quick to point out that the Secret Service rarely sees a major shuffle at the top of the agency when a new administration changes over. Multiple sources have expressed concern about the loss of institutional knowledge. Since July 13, when Donald Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania, multiple assistant directors and deputy assistant directors have left. Curran’s statement thanked former acting Director Ron Rowe for his service to the agency. “Mr. Rowe navigated the past six months with grace, resilience, and a profound sense of responsibility,” Curran wrote. A memo from Rowe last week was signed “deputy director Rowe.” Curran’s statement did not say Rowe will go back to his old spot. Instead, the statement says, Darryl Volpicelli will remain as the acting Deputy Director. It is not clear where Rowe will go next. Here’s a look at more of the changes, according to Curran’s statement: A blue-ribbon panel commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security issued a scathing report in October that recommended leadership at the agency be replaced with outside individuals who could change the culture of the Secret Service, including the “present sense of complacency within the Service.” President Donald Trump said he wasn’t “100% sure” that he cannot run for a third term as president. “I’ve raised a lot of money for the next race, that I assume I can’t use for myself, but I’m not 100% sure,” Trump said Monday at the House Republican Members Conference dinner in Doral, Florida. He added a moment of lighthearted uncertainty, asking Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, “I’m not sure, am I allowed to run again, Mike? I better not get you involved in that.” This is not the first time Trump has hinted at the possibility of seeking three terms in office. In an appearance last Sunday in Las Vegas, Nevada, he remarked, “It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve not once, but twice or three times,” further stoking speculation about his future political plans. Some context:Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee has spoken about amending the US Constitution to permit Trump to run for a third term. But it’sdifficult to amendthe Constitution, which hasn’t been changed since the 27th Amendment was ratified in 1992. Formally proposing an amendment requires either a two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives and Senate — Republicans do not hold enough seats to pass it — or via a constitutional convention, which hasn’t been held since the 18th century. Then, to ratify a new amendment, three-fourths of state legislatures (so 38 states) would need to approve it. Here’s what else Trump spoke about at the conference dinner: On TikTok:At the conference dinner, Trump reiterated his fondness for the app and his preference that it be sold by its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance. “China won’t be involved,” he said while insisting “a lot of people” are seeking to purchase the platform. On Medicare and Social Security:The president said he will not sign a bill that includes “even a single penny” of cuts to Medicare or Social Security benefits, reiterating a commitment he made during his campaign. On Colombia:In his first comments on the mass deportation effort launched under his administration, Trump took a victory lap on immigration, saying Colombia, “agreed with us almost immediately after I got involved,” followinga dispute over deportation flightsover the weekend thatthreatened to spiral into a damaging trade warbetween the two nations. On DeepSeek:After the Chinese artificial intelligence company unveileda ChatGPT-like AI modeloperating at a fraction of the cost of comparable US models, Trump said the announcement “should be a wake-up call” for US tech companies. The Senate confirmed Scott Bessent to lead the Treasury Department in a 68-29 vote on Monday night. Bessent is the fifth of President Donald Trump’s nominees confirmed by the Senate and received bipartisan support. As secretary, Bessent will play a key role in enacting Trump’s agenda, as the GOP-led Congress works to extend the 2017 tax cuts before they expire at the end of the year and grapples with the debt limit. That comes on the back of strong growth and a low, 4.1% unemployment rate, although inflation continues to hover above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. A steady US economy makes Bessent’s work a bit easier. His “3-3-3” economic plan includes bringing the federal budget deficit down to 3%, achieving 3% GDP and producing 3 million more barrels of oil a day by the end of Trump’s second term. Trump has also emphasized his desire to levy tariffs on some of the country’s top trading partners, particularly China, Canada and Mexico, as soon as this week – a move that experts warn could spark inflation as American consumers pick up the tab for those higher prices. Vice President JD Vance is working to set his priorities for the next four years. On Monday, he visited Damascus, Virginia, where recovery efforts are underway after Hurricane Helene. He also announced new hires on his staff. Here’s the latest: President Donald Trump is expected to signthe Laken Riley Actinto law Wednesday, a White House official confirms. The White House signing is likely to be the first piece of legislation to cross Trump’s desk for a signature and marks his first major win for a top priority for Congressional Republicans. The official did not respond to CNN’s inquiry about who would be in attendance at the signing, which was first reported by CBS News. Trump told reporters last Friday in North Carolina he would be “honored” to be signing the bill at a ceremony “very shortly.” The Senate passed the bill early last week, and the House followed suit on Wednesday, passing the law 263 to 156, with 46 Democrats voting in favor. CNN hasreportedthe bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to detain undocumented migrants who are in the US unlawfully or without legal status if they have been charged with, arrested for, convicted of, or have admitted to certain criminal offenses, including theft and burglary. The Senate adopted amendments to expand the list of criminal offenses covered under the bill to include assault on law enforcement officers and crimes resulting in death or serious bodily injury. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could visit the White House as soon as early next week, people familiar with the matter said, putting him on track to become the first foreign leader to meet with President Donald Trump since he was sworn in. The planning for a visit was still not finalized, and no date has officially been selected for a visit. US and Israeli officials described the plans for a visit as preliminary. However, the two leaders discussed Netanyahu visiting Washington during a telephone call in the days before last week’s inauguration. And Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was traveling in the region this week, including to Israel, where arrangements for a visit could be finalized. A spokesman for Netanyahu wrote on social media that no official invitation had been extended for a visit. Talks with another world leader:Elsewhere,Trump held a “productive” call with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, the White House said. The leaders addressed key regional issues, including security in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East and Europe. Trump emphasized the need for India to increase procurement of American-made security equipment and move toward a fair-trade relationship, according to a readout of the call. Plans for a White House visit by Modi were also discussed. President Donald Trump on Monday is expected to signfour executive orders that would reshape the military, including banning transgender service members from serving in the US armed forces. A transgender army veteran warns that this could could result in significant operational issues. Thousands of transgender service members currently serve in the military, many of them in specialized positions “requiring years of training and expertise,” Laila Ireland told CNN on Monday. Removing them would result in significant “operational gaps, weakening the effectiveness of our armed forces and our national security,” she said. Some context:In 2018, there were an estimated 14,000 transgender service members in the US military, according to thePalm Center, an independent research institute that has conducted extensive research on sexual minorities in the military. Ireland and her husband are both transgender. While she is retired, her husband is an active duty service member. She said transgender service members are fully capable deployable even as they transition. “So after transition, transgender service members are capable, effective, and lethal, like every qualified service member,” Ireland added. Several officials who worked on thecriminal investigations into Donald Trumphave been fired, according to sources familiar with the matter. A letter from acting Attorney General James McHenry to the officials said they cannot be “trusted” to “faithfully” implement Trump’s agenda. The firings are effective “immediately,” according to the letter the officials received, which also notified them they have 30 days to appeal their “removal from federal service.” “You played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,” the letter said “The proper functioning of government critically depends on the trust superior officials place in their subordinates. Given your significant role in prosecuting the President, I do not believe that the leadership of the Department can trust you to assist in implementing the President’s agenda faithfully. As a result, pursuant to Article Il of the Constitution and the laws of the United States, your employment with the Department of Justice is hereby terminated, and you are removed from federal service effective immediately.”  Some of the individuals worked with special counsel Jack Smith, whose office has been closed down after he dropped the two criminal cases against Trump. Read the full letter: This post was updated with additional details from the acting attorney general’s letter. President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence czar said the startling advances by a Chinese AI company, DeepSeek, demonstrate the necessity of remaining vigilant in the emerging industry — while also blaming the previous Biden administration for “hamstringing” US firms. “DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO (executive order), which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not.) I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” David Sacks, the former PayPal executive and current White House AI and crypto czar, wrote on social media. Upon taking office, Trump revoked a Biden-era order on AI that enacted some new regulation on AI development. It was among the nearly 80 orders reversed when Trump took office. The revoked order also addressed issues of equity and discrimination within the AI industry. The White House said the Biden order “established unnecessarily burdensome requirements for companies developing and deploying AI that would stifle private sector innovation and threaten American technological leadership.” Some background:DeepSeek, a one-year-old startup, revealed astunning capability last week: It presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s and Meta’s popular AI models. Colombia is sending an Air Force plane to the United States to repatriate 110 Colombians, the country’s foreign ministry said Monday. The plane will take off from Colombia’s CATAM Military Airport on Monday afternoon and is due to arrive in San Diego, California, to pick up the deportees. Remember:Colombia on Sunday reached an agreement with the US to accept deported migrants being returned on military planes, aftera flurry of threatsfrom President Donald Trump that included steep tariffs. The foreign ministry said the Colombian Air Force flight complies with the Colombian government’s commitments and meets the standard of what it described as the “dignified return” of deportees. The flight will also carry medical personnel and officials from Colombia’s migration agency and foreign ministry. Colombia said it expects to send another plane in the next few days with the same objective. The Trump administration is taking its first concrete step to investigate prosecutors who oversaw the criminal cases against January 6 defendants after President Donald Trump vowed to seek retribution as a key pledge of his campaign, according to multiple sources who have seen an internal memo on the matter. Ed Martin, the interim US attorney in Washington, DC, haslaunched an investigation into prosecutorswho brought obstruction charges against some rioters that were ultimately tossed because of a Supreme Court decision last summer.  Referring to the effort as a “special project,” Martin wrote in the memo issued Monday that the attorneys should hand over “all information you have related to the use of 1512 charges, including all files, documents, notes, emails, and other information” to two of the office’s long-term prosecutors who must submit a report on the probe by Friday. The demand for documents also extends to prosecutors who have since left the US attorney’s office. Remember:The move comes as the Justice Department has already seen a dramatic shakeup as officials connected to high-profile investigations have been reassigned, including the now-dismissed case against Trump himself for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. About Ed Martin:Martin, a hardline, socially conservative activist and commentator whowas an organizerwith the “Stop the Steal” movement tapped for the role last week. Since starting the job, he has praised Trump for issuing mass pardons for January 6 defendants. Leaders from Europe to Latin America are responding to US President Donald Trump’s first week in office. Defined by a flurry of executive orders, a crackdown on immigration and tough rhetoric, world leaders are preparing to take action as the measures continue. Latin America and the Caribbean:Leaders are set to hold an urgent regional bloc meeting on Thursday to discuss migration in the region, among other topics. Honduran President Xiomara Castro, who currently leads the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), called the meeting at the request of Colombia President Gustavo Petro during hisdiplomatic feud with Trumpon Sunday over migrant deportation flights. CNN reported that Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva would likely participate remotely as he is still being closely monitored for a head injury. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum hinted that she would also attend but said they are waiting for more details. European Union:The EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday that the bloc is “not negotiating” on the sovereignty of Greenland, following remarks by Trump that he wantscontrol over the Arctic island. Kallas said the EU “supporting our member state Denmark and its autonomous region, Greenland.” She also said Europe needed to “close ranks” as the “United States shifts to a more transactional approach” in its foreign relations. Trump has previously described US control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, as an “absolute necessity.” Both Greenland and Denmark have said previously that the island is not for sale. Denmark:Additionally, Denmark said on Monday it would spend 14.6 billion Danish crowns ($2.05 billion) boosting its military capabilities in the Arctic. The agreement aims to “improve capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region,” according to a statement from Denmark’s Ministry of Defense. Vivian Motzfeldt, Denmark’s minister of statehood and foreign affairs, said that “Greenland is facing a changing security landscape.” This post has been updated with news of Denmark’s increased military spending. One of theinspectors general firedby President Donald Trump on Friday night said he is concerned the purge signals that the independent oversight is being removed. Hannibal “Mike” Ware, a former inspector general and the chair of theCouncil of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, told CNN on Monday he is not arguing that a president does not have the right to remove a sitting inspectors general, but “there’s just a way that we go about this to ensure that there is fairness in the process and that our independence is maintained.” Notably, a 2022 law requires the White House to provide a 30-day notice and substantive rationale for terminating any inspector general. He said the reason they were given for why they were being fired was because of “changing priorities of the administration.” But, Ware argued that inspectors general are “not part of the administration by design” so that they can maintain oversight. “The issue is by completely gutting all the, basically almost all the IG shops of their leadership, demonstrates that the independence is being completely removed, that people who are viewed as more like loyalists are being put in position,” Ware said. If this weren’t the case, he said, the Trump administration would have followed the law. What is an inspectors general:AnIG conducts investigationsand audits into any potential malfeasance, fraud, waste or abuse by a government agency or its personnel, and issues reports and recommendations on its findings. Ware said among those removed were “some of the highest, strongest performing” inspectors general. He touted that collectively, they have returned nearly $40 billion to the Treasury though their work and have thousands of ongoing investigations. A federal judge has rescinded his order barring several members of the right-wing Oath Keepers from entering Washington, DC, or the grounds of the US Capitol without first receiving court permission, after interim US Attorney Edward Martin argued in court filings the restrictions should be lifted. Therestrictionswere originally put in place for eight members of the group — many of whom had been found guilty of seditious conspiracy for events around the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack — following President Donald Trump’s commutation of their sentences last week. “It is not for this court to divine why President Trump commuted Defendants’ sentences, or to assess whether it was sensible to do so,” Judge Amit Mehta wrote in his order Monday, noting that while Trump’s act of clemency didn’t change the original sentence, “it would be improper for the court post-commutation to modify the original sentences” by adding location restrictions.  Mehta also said that the defendants “are no longer bound” by conditions of supervised release. One of those affected, the group’s founder Stewart Rhodes, has thanked Trump repeatedly and attended Trump’s event in Las Vegas on Saturday. In comments to reporters following his release from prison, Rhodes has said he still believes the 2020 election was stolen and that Trump supporters were provoked by police during the Capitol attack. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) takes actions all across the United States, a former agency official explained that the operations could be similar to those conducted during the Obama, Biden and first Trump administrations. Authorities will scrub the “court records, jail records, probation and parole records, looking for anyone who might have a nexus to the criminal justice system, and is also deportable, but that somehow ICE missed,” explained John Sandweg, former acting director at ICE. The key difference between current actions and previous ones is that this Trump administration has “lowered the threshold” for who is targeted, Sandweg said. “During the Biden administration, you had to be convicted of what was termed a ‘serious crime,’ and you needed to be convicted of that crime to be a target of these types of operations. The Trump administration is taking anyone who’s had a brush with the law, whether they’ve been convicted or not,” which could include “individuals who might have been booked on a traffic offense,” Sandweg said.  After going through the records, ICE builds target lists to go door-knocking, Sandweg said. Once ICE agents go into a house, they would not only focus on the target, but also could look into anyone else found there. “You find a family living there or a group home. These ICE agents in these operations will run the identities of everybody in the house taken into custody” to determine whether they were connected to the crime or are undocumented, Sandweg told CNN. However, these target lists are not sustainable, Sandweg warned. “You just don’t find that many criminals in the United States, they’re going to exhaust those those people with a nexus to criminal justice system very quickly,” he said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN Monday that Department of Health and Human Services secretary nomineeRobert Kennedy Jr. has effectively given reassurances to Republican senators skeptical of his view on vaccines and other controversial issues. Thune said Donald Trump’s pick to run the department has a path to be confirmed even though it’s not clear yet how a handful of them will vote. Kennedy faces a pair of confirmation hearings this week where his ability to explain his views will be tested. “He’ll have that opportunity in front of the world this week,” Thune said. “I think in his private meeting he’s given a lot of reassurances, at least in the readouts that I’m getting from those meetings. And that was my experience in the one I had with him.”  Pressed on whether Kennedy can get enough votes to be confirmed in the Senate that Republicans control with a 53-47 margin, Thune said he will wait until after the hearings to say for sure. “As I’ve said before with all these nominees there’s a path, but I reserve judgment until after they go through the hearing process. My job is to make sure they get that process. But, yeah, I think there’s a way for him to get there,” he said. All Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote to Secretary of State Marco Rubio to express concern about recent actions at the State Department, including thesuspension of foreign assistanceand the Refugee Assistance Program. The 22 Democratic lawmakers on the committee, which has oversight of the State Department, said such steps “gut core State Department programs and responsibilities.” “These actions undermine America’s credibility and put U.S. diplomats, American implementers, and vulnerable people around the world at risk,” they wrote in a letter dated Monday and seen by CNN.  “They belie a lack of understanding of the value of diplomacy, the Department of State as an institution, and the work that thousands of dedicated public servants do every day to make the American people safer and more prosperous,” they continued. The State Department has frozen almost all foreign aid, effective immediately, and alsosuspended refugee admissions and assistancefor people who have newly resettled in the US. The lawmakers also raised concerns about theelimination of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs— a move taken under an executive order issued by President Trump. They said they “are deeply troubled by early steps the Trump Administration has taken to sideline, remove, or reassign many apolitical, career foreign service and civil service professionals at the Department without cause.” “We reiterate our firm hope — and expectation — to have a collaborative and fruitful relationship with you and the Department during your tenure as Secretary of State,” they wrote. “But the troubling developments we have referenced here — among the many others that have already been reported in just the first few days of the Trump Administration — raise questions about whether the agency you now lead will continue to successfully serve the American people or serve the personal whims of the President of the United States.”  The letter does not have any Republican signatories and Republican House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast has praised the actions taken by the administration. Minnesota state Rep. Leigh Finke, the first out transgender member of the state’s legislature, said Monday that President Donald Trump’sexpected executive order to ban transgender service membersin the military is meant to “scare people and to create uncertainty” and “push people towards discrimination of transgender people,” while weakening the military by diminishing its ranks. “The military is the largest employer of transgender Americans. You heard up to 14,000, 15,000 members identify as trans, and 56 of our retired generals have said that our trans members are ready to serve,” Finke told Pamela Brown on “CNN Newsroom.” “This will only make our military less ready to serve by taking 15,000 people who volunteered out of service.”  Some context:Hours after being sworn in for his second term last week, Trump signed an order revoking the Biden administration’s 2021 move to allow transgender members to serve. However, the order Trump is expected to sign on Monday goes even further, a White House official told CNN, and will outline new military standards regarding gender pronouns and state that mental and physical readiness requires transgender service members be banned from the military. The White House is using the treatment process of gender-affirming care as a reason for the changes, saying that transgender members are not “physically capable” of serving. “It can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery, which often involves the use of heavy narcotics. During this period, they are not physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements,” one of the officials said, citing a fact sheet. Finke argues that decision should be made between a doctor and a patient, not via an executive order. “If individuals are prescribed a medication by their doctors and that medication does or does not interfere with their ability to do their work, then that is something that those patients and their doctors should be discussing. It is not something to be releasing via executive order,” Finke said. CNN’s Alayna Treene and Pamela Brown contributed reporting to this post. President Donald Trump’s administration launched animmigration enforcement blitz nationwideon Sunday, resulting in nearly 1,000 arrests andactions across multiple cities, including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. On his first day as Defense Secretary, Pete Hegsethsaid the government would provide whatever assistanceis required at the United States’ southern border. The immigration actions comeamid a resolved impasse between Colombia and the USover deportation flights after a flurry of threats from Trump that included steep tariffs. Meanwhile, deportations from the US to Mexico and Guatemala have not increased significantly since Trump returned to office, leaders of those countries said on Monday. Here’s what to know about Trump’s immigration crackdown: •Operations willcontinue two to three times a week: ICE will continue its “enhanced operations” across the Southeast US about two to three time a week, according to a source with knowledge of the operations. The “enhanced operations” will involve various agencies. All the agencies have been given Title 8 authority, meaning they can apprehend immigrants underCustoms and Border Protection’s immigration authority. •ICE hotline sees spike in calls: The hotline receiving tips about possible ICE sightings in Chicago neighborhoods has been ringing off the hook since Sunday morning — when the Trump Administration immigration blitz started, according to Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR), the organization that runs the hotline. The increase in calls has been driven by neighbors and passersby calling the hotline to report federal agents knocking on either their door or the doors of people in their neighborhood, according to ICIRR. •More reinforcements to the border:Another 400 members of the Texas National Guardare heading to the US-Mexico border“to collaborate with US Border Patrol agents,” Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday. The members of the Tactical Border Force,created in 2023to be manned with “specially trained soldiers,” will leave immediately from bases in Fort Worth and Houston, the governor said, along with C-130 transport planes and Chinook helicopters. • Federal agents in immigration raids told to be camera-ready:At leasttwo agencies assisting US immigration officialswith the raids have told personnel to ensure their clothing clearly depicts their respective agency in case they are filmed by members of the media, sources familiar with the operations tell CNN. While it is a common safety practice for agents conducting arrests to wear insignias clearly identifying themselves as law enforcement, even agents on the perimeter of operations conducted across the nation have been specifically instructed by their leadership to wear raid jacketsin view of media attention, sources said.

The schedule indicates that Monday’s sessions will largely be social in nature, with Trump’s speech to the conference later this evening as the main event. Here’s what is expected the rest of the week: The timing:To enact Trump’s agenda, the both houses in the GOP-led Congress will have to first adopt a non-binding budget blueprint, something Speaker Mike Johnson wants on the House floor by end of February. Then they will have to draft binding reconciliation legislation and try to get it approved in both chambers. That bill can’t be filibustered in the Senate. Johnson wants it all approved in the House by May, but the process is arduous, filled with major hurdles, and complicated by their razor-thin majority. Deportations from the US to Mexico and Guatemala have not increased significantly since President Donald Trump returned to office, leaders of those countries said on Monday. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that between January 20 and 26, Mexico received 4,094 deportees — most of whom were Mexican nationals. Four repatriation flights recently arrived at Mexico City’s Felipe Ángeles International Airport. But the Mexican president stressed that the figures do not represent a significant increase compared to other periods. “If we look at it on a weekly basis, the numbers are consistent with what our country has experienced in the past,” she said. According to data published by Mexico’s National Institute of Migration, about 4,000 Mexicans were repatriated from the US each week between January and November of 2024. Sheinbaum also addressed the issue of non-Mexican deportees, acknowledging that Mexico does not yet have a completely defined coordinated strategy with the US on the matter. But she assured that her government is working on it. Guatemala is set to receive two deportation planes on Monday, with each carrying about 80 migrants. One is a military plane; the other is a civilian aircraft, the vice president said. Guatemalan Vice President Karin Herrera told CNN her country has also not seen an increase in the number of migrants deported from the United States. As she awaited the arrival of the planes at an airport in Guatemala City, she stressed that the only difference from the last US administration is the migrants are coming in on military aircraft, which Guatemala won’t limit. Herrera also said her country’s relationship with the US remains fluid and that officials from both sides remain in communication. She added that Guatemala is looking for ways to create job opportunities for migrants deported from the US. This post has been updated with comments from Guatemala’s vice president. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Monday that would begin the process of creating a “next generation” missile defense shield for the US, according to a fact sheet on the order obtained by CNN. The order calls for an “Iron Dome” for an America, borrowing the name of the vaunted short-range Israeli missile defense system that for years has been used to intercept launches from Gaza. The US provided billions of dollars in funding to Iron Dome, and the US Army has its own system. “The Executive Order directs implementation of a next generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next generation aerial attacks,” the fact sheet reads, calling such potential attacks as a “catastrophic threat.”  This order calls for an advanced space-based series of systems to detect and shoot down launches against the United States. It does not say how much the shield would cost or outline a timescale for its development. Some background:Trump promised on the campaign trail to direct the military to create “an impenetrable dome to protect our people,” in the model of Israel’s. Despite Israel’s advanced air defense systems and relatively small area to defend, scores of missile launches and drones have penetrated deep into Israel’s airspace, highlighting the inherent difficulty of fulfilling Trump’s promise. Nearly 1,000 people were arrested across the United States over the weekend after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched a series of enforcement actions targeting undocumented immigrants. The actions were carried out in Atlanta, Puerto Rico, Chicago, Los Angeles, Austin Texas and Colorado. Separately, Colombia walked back from the brink of a damaging trade war with the US after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs after Colombia turned away planes carrying migrants. Now, Colombia is sending its own planes to the US to collect citizens. Here’s how lawmakers are reacting to the crackdown: Florida Rep. Carlos Gimenez:Speaking to CNN, Gimenez, who serves on the Homeland Security Committee, said he believed Colombia sending its own planes to collect citizens would “save American taxpayers some money.” Gimenez also said Trump was “coming through with his promises” to crack down on immigration. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro:Castro said Americans want a secure border, safe communities and a prosperous economy, but what Trump is doing is “causing chaos rather than address those things.” Castro also criticized Trump for removing a Biden executive order that stated that criminals should be prioritized for expatriation, claiming that for Trump, the raids are “in some ways a big show. This chaos is a big reality TV show. He had TV talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw over there in Chicago at the ICE raids,” he said. Castro also noted that there are diplomatic channels to engage with Colombia about who is taking the migrants, rather than taking to social media. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul:TheAttorney General of Illinois toldCNN that Chicago had not been made informed about planned immigrationarrests in the city, despite having a good working relationship with the city’s federal law enforcement partners during the previous Trump administration. “Quite frankly,the notifications I’m getting is from you and the rest of the media, unfortunately,” Kwame Raoul told CNN’s Jim Acosta. Raoul told CNN he believesimmigration enforcement should take place, however, it should not be for political reasons or be publicized. Another 400 members of the Texas National Guard are heading to the US-Mexico border “to collaborate with US Border Patrol agents,” Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday. The members of the Tactical Border Force,created in 2023to be manned with “specially trained soldiers,” will leave immediately from bases in Fort Worth and Houston, the governor said, along with C-130 transport planes and Chinook helicopters. “Texas has a partner in the White House we can work with to secure the Texas-Mexico border,” Abbottsaid in a written statement. Last week, Abbottsent a letterto congressional leaders asking the federal government to reimburse the cost of his state’s border operations, which he estimated at over $11 billion since 2022. Operation Lone Star is a National Guard initiative at the border, led by the Texas National Guard. There are roughly4,500 National Guardsmencurrently assigned to the mission, according to the Texas Military Department. Colombia is sending two government planes to pick up migrants who were originally scheduled to go on military flights, according to a Trump administration official and a Colombian official. It comes after a major clash between the United States and Colombia over a pair of military flights carrying migrants that were abruptly rejected over the weekend — bringing the countries on the brink of a trade war. After a tense feud that unfolded publicly, the White House said late Sunday that Colombia had agreed to accept deportation flights — both on civilian and military aircraft — and that the tariffs would be held off pending implementation of the deal. As of Monday morning, two planes were enroute to the United States to pick up Colombian migrants who had recently crossed the US southern border, officials told CNN. Colombia also agreed to reinforce theDarien Gap, a treacherous stretch of jungle between Colombia and Panama that migrants have crossed on their journey to the United States, with more manpower, according to the Trump administration official. CNN has reached out to the White House and Colombian government for comment. On his first day as Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth said the government would provide whatever assistance is required at the United States’ southern border and confirmed that more executive orders regarding the military would be enacted Monday. “Whatever is needed at the border will be provided. Whether that is through state active duty, Title 32 or Title 10, because we are reorienting — this is a shift. This is not the way business has been done in the past,” he said, referring to the laws governing the US armed forces while speaking to reporters outside the Pentagon.“The Defense Department will support the defense of the territorial integrity of the United States of America at the southern border,” he said when asked if more troops would be sent to the border.  Hegseth confirmed that President Donald Trump would be signing executive orders on Monday regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military, transgender service members, and reinstating service members who were booted from the military after refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. “Today there are more executive orders coming, we fully support, on removing DEI inside the Pentagon, reinstating troops who were pushed out because of Covid mandates, iron dome for America — this is happening quickly, and as the Secretary of Defense it’s an honor to salute smartly as I did as a junior officer and now as the Secretary of Defense to ensure these orders are complied with rapidly and quickly,” Hegseth said. Hegseth was greeted by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, and a crowd of press outside the building’s entrance. Asked if he would be firing Brown or other members of the joint chiefs of staff, Hegseth turned and clapped Brown on the arm, saying, “I’m standing with him right now, looking forward to working with him.” Hegsethhas previously saidthat Brown needed to be fired. Just before walking into the Pentagon, Hegseth said he would make sure there’s “accountability for what happened in Afghanistan,” regarding the chaotic withdrawal from the country in 2021, and said, “we stand by our allies.” Last week, the Trump administration took steps tosuspend the US refugee programandcancelled flightsfor refugees expecting to come to the US, which advocates said could impact thousands of Afghans who worked alongside the US military in Afghanistan. See his remarksin this videoor watch below: Pete Hegseth arrives for his first day at the Pentagon after being sworn in as Defense Secretary over the weekend. Speaking to reporters, Hegseth laid out the priorities for the department and hinted at more executive orders to come from President Trump.#cnn#news CNN’s Manu Raju tells you what you need to know from President Donald Trump’s flurry of executive actions and policy changes in his first whirlwind week in office. The Trump administration launched an immigration enforcement blitz nationwide Sunday that included multiple federal agencies and resulted in the arrest of nearly 1,000 people, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The apprehensions are part of an effort to amass a larger enforcement apparatus by pulling in a range of federal agencies that have been granted extended immigration authority under the Trump administration. On Sunday, the actions took place across the country with 956 people arrested and “554 detainers lodged,” ICE said in apost on X. Here’s where enforcement was carried out: Hear the story of one family in Chicago: The Trump administration launched an immigration sweep across the nation that resulted in the arrest of nearly 1,000 people, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. CNN's affiliate WLS reported on one family that was impacted by the raids in Chicago.#cnn#news#immigrationtiktok#iceraids#chicago#trump In addition to an executive order that would ban transgender troops from serving on Monday, President Donald Trump is expected to sign two others that would reshape the military. The orders come after Trump’s nominee to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, was sworn in as secretary of defense on Saturday. Hegseth has long stated he planned to implement major cultural changes to the military, including ending DEI practices and removing “woke” service members. A second EO states that any “discriminatory” policies related to DEI in the military will be banned. The order comes after the Trump administration ordered employees in any federal diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility offices to be placed on paid administrative leave “effective immediately.” All DEI practices in the US armed forces will also be subject to an internal review by Hegseth. The third executive order directs Hegseth to reinstate all active and reserve service members who were previously discharged for failing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. They will be reinstated with their former rank and given back pay and benefits, one of the officials said. However, the Pentagon had already rescinded the military’sCovid-19 vaccination mandateallowing them to rejoin after President Joe Biden signed the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act requiring the change. CNN reported in October 2023, that only 43 of the more than 8,000 US service members who were discharged from the military for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19 sought to rejoin eight months after the vaccine mandate was officially repealed. President Donald Trump isexpected to sign three executive orderson Monday that would reshape the military, including banning transgender service members from serving in the US armed forces, gutting the military’s Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs and reinstating service members with backpay who were discharged for refusing to get vaccinated from Covid-19, two Trump White House officials told CNN. Remember:The orders come as Trump’s nominee to lead the pentagon, Pete Hegseth, was sworn in as secretary of defense on Saturday. Hegseth has long stated he planned to implement major cultural changes to the military, including ending DEI practices and removing “woke” service members. Trump had banned transgender Americans from serving in the military in 2017, during his first administration, however former President Joe Biden issued an order in 2021 repealing the ban. Hours after being sworn into his second term last week, Trump signed an order revoking the Biden administration’s 2021 move to allow transgender members from serving. However, the order Trump is expected to sign on Monday goes even further, one of the officials said, and will outline new military standards regarding gender pronouns and stating that mental and physical readiness requires transgender service members be banned from the military. “It can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery, which often involves the use of heavy narcotics. During this period, they are not physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements,” one of the officials said, citing a fact sheet regarding the executive order states.  In 2018, there was an estimated 14,000 transgender service members in the US military, according to thePalm Center, an independent research institute that has conducted extensive research on sexual minorities in the military. APentagon memodetailing the ban during Trump’s first term in office recommended making exceptions for transgender service members already serving in uniform, who had joined the military under previous policies before the ban took effect; those who do not require a change in gender; and those who had been “stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to accession.” It’s unclear if the administration’s new ban will also have exceptions. President Donald Trump will meet today with House Republicans attending the Republican Issues Conference at his Doral golf resort in South Florida. The president said last week that voters were more concerned with immigration than with high grocery prices. But Republican hopes of clinging to theirnarrow House majorityin next year’s midterm elections may rest on him making tangible economic progress. The meeting is expected to focus on how to advance his agenda, including tax cuts and funds for his mass deportation program, through Congress. The party’s slim majority has enormous implications for Trump’s efforts to forge ahead with his agenda. The Trump administration is threatening a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday — a move that would almost immediately impact car dealerships and factories in the United States. The tariffs would add a minimum of thousands of dollars to the cost of cars, according to experts. And not just cars that are assembled in those two countries and shipped to the United States, but also cars built at American auto plants, all of which have Canadian and Mexican parts that can not easily be replaced. President Donald Trump had argued on the campaign trail that tariffs are the only way to save the American auto industry, even though automakers are reporting record, or near-record, profits without them. But what is clear is that tariffs could upend the production of vehicles across the continent and put the price of cars, already near record highs, out of reach for many buyers. Car factories could start slowing down — or even shutting down — in relatively short order, Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at S&P Global Mobility, told CNN last week. That’s because even if a car is assembled in the United States, every vehicle has parts imported from Mexico and Canada that would be subject to the tariffs, raising production costs. There simply is no such thing as an all-American car. Read more hereabout why car prices could rise if tariffs are imposed One of the inspectors generalfired by President Donald Trumplast week expressed concern to CNN on Monday about who will replace him, warning that “nominating and appointing political lackeys” would harm Americans. Mark Greenblatt, who worked for the Department of the Interior, emphasized that it’s important that inspectors general are “independent” and “not beholden to a political party.” “The question is … what will President Trump do with these positions? Is he going to nominate watchdogs or is he going to nominate lap dogs?” Greenblatt said to CNN’s Kasie Hunt.  Greenblatt said he received an email on Friday night notifying him of his termination, citing “changing priorities.” According to Greenblatt, his email has already been cut off and he has no idea what is going to happen to his belongings in the office. “I don’t know what the basis of the removal was, but we’ve been doing good, high-impact work, trying to help the American taxpayer,” Greenblatt said. “We are the taxpayers’ representatives inside the Department of the Interior.” Greenblatt said he is proud of the “ fair, objective, independent oversight” his team has done and emphasized that Trump should “nominate independent-minded folks.” The purge of inspectors general late last week affected a broad swath of the federal government, including the departments of State, Energy, the Interior, Defense and Transportation.

First Colombia turned away US military planes carrying migrants, then President Donald Trump threatened Bogota with steep tariffs, before the two countries reached an agreement. It’s hard to believe that unfolded in just one Sunday. But yesterday, Colombia walked back from the brink of a damaging trade war with the United States. Here’s how it unfolded: •Flights turned away: Colombian President Gustavo Petro blocked US military flights carrying deportees to Colombia on Sunday morning. Documents reviewed by CNN show Colombia had previously approved the flights, though Petro disputed he had authorized them. Petro blocked the planes from landing, accusing the US of treating Colombian migrants like criminals. • Trump threats:After the flights were blocked, Trump ordered steep tariffs on all Colombian imports, a travel ban for Colombian citizens, the revocation of visas for Colombian officials in the US, and the suspension of visa processing for both immigrant and non-immigrant visas. •Colombia’s response: In response, Petro threatened retaliatory tariffs on the US and attacked Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on social media, writing: “You will never see me burning a US flag or carrying out a raid to return handcuffed illegal immigrants to the US.” •Agreement reached:By Sunday evening, the White House announced the two countries had reached their agreement. Colombia said it had agreed to “all of President Trump’s terms,” including the “unrestricted acceptance” of immigrants who entered the US illegally and said the Colombian presidential plane was being prepared to assist with repatriation.The White House also backed off its threat to impose tariffs unless Colombia “fails to honor this agreement,” adding other penalties will stay in place until the first plane of Colombian deportees is successfully returned.  Watch more about the diplomatic tensions in the video below: President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Colombia after its president blocked US military deportation flights. In response, Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced an increase in tariffs on US imports. CNN's Stefano Pozzebon has more.#cnn#news Donald Trump claimed an early victory for a coercive foreign policy based on tariffs and hard power on Sunday after announcing Colombiahad backed downin a dispute over migrant repatriation flights. The president had earlier unveiled swift and painful punishment, including huge tariffs, on the US ally in his most overt attempt yet to make an example of a nation that crossed him and to assert dominance in the Western Hemisphere. The crisis erupted when Colombian President Gustavo Petro blocked US military flights carrying undocumented migrants from landing, in a hitch for the mass deportation operation meant to honor one of Trump’s most high-profile campaign promises. The US president jumped at a chance to show his supporters how tough he can be and to demonstrate to other countries in Latin America the price of resisting migrant repatriations. After hours of tensions with Bogota, the White House said Colombia had agreed to accept migrant flights, including on military aircraft, and that tariffs would be held off pending its implementation of the deal. “Today’s events make clear to the world that America is respected again,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement late Sunday. “President Trump will continue to fiercely protect our nation’s sovereignty, and he expects all other nations of the world to fully cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States.”  Read Collision’s full analysis here. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices have been told to meet a new quota of 75 arrests per day as the Trump administration tries to dramatically ramp up apprehensions of undocumented immigrants in the US, according two sources. In the last fiscal year, ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations conducted 113,431 administrative arrests, according to an agency report. That would be about 310 arrests a day. The latest directive to ICE teams would pave the way to surpassing that number, while placing additional pressure on ICE agents. Major operation is underway:The Trump administrationlaunched an immigration enforcement blitzin Chicago on Sunday that includes several federal agencies that have been granted additional authorities to arrest undocumented immigrants in the US, according to multiple sources. ICE agents are expected to be joined by officials from multiple Department of Justice agencies as they target public safety and national security threats. It’s a multiday operation that will spread across the country. The Chicago operationis part of a broader effort to add manpower to ICE, which has limited resources and agents. Big picture:President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdownhas included sweeping executive ordersrestricting legal pathways to come to the US, expanding the powers of immigration authorities, attempting to banbirthright citizenshipand threatening sanctuary jurisdictions.

        "content": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: USstocksdropped sharply Monday — and chipmaker Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion in market value — after a surprise advancement from a Chinese artificial intelligence company,DeepSeek, threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry. DeepSeek, a one-year-old startup, revealed a stunning capability last week: It presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s or Meta’s popular AI models. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million on computing power for its base model, compared with the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies. That sent shockwaves through markets, in particular the tech sector, on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged by 3.1% and the broader S&P 500 fell 1.5%. The Dow, boosted by health care and consumer companies that could be hurt by AI, was up 289 points, or about 0.7% higher. Stock market losses were far deeper at the beginning of the day. Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would needtrillions of dollarsin investment to support the development of in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models. Marc Andreessen, a supporter of President Donald Trump and one of the world’s leading tech investors, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” ina post on X. The stunning achievement from a relatively unknown AI startup becomes even more shocking when considering that the United States for years has worked torestrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was able to achieve its low-cost model on under-powered AI chips. US tech stocks got hammered Monday. Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, fell nearly 17% and lost $588.8 billion in market value — by far the most market value a stock has ever lost in a single day, more than doubling theprevious record of $240 billionset by Meta nearly three years ago. For perspective, Nvidia lost more in market value Monday than all but 13 companies are worth — period. Nvidia began the day as the most valuable publicly traded stock on the market — over $3.4 trillion — after its shares more than doubled in each of the past two years. It ended the day in third place behind Apple and Microsoft. Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply. Nvidia competitors Marvell, Broadcom, Micron and TSMC all fell sharply, too. Oracle (ORCL), Vertiv, Constellation, NuScale and other energy and data center companies tumbled. That dragged down the broader stock market, because tech stocks make up a significant chunk of the market — tech constitutes about 45% of the S&P 500, according to Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist. “The bottom line is the US outperformance has been driven by tech and the lead that US companies have in AI,” Lerner said. “The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending).” This week kicks off a series of tech companies reporting earnings, so their response to the DeepSeek stunner could lead to tumultuous market movements in the days and weeks to come. In the meantime, investors are taking a closer look at Chinese AI companies. “Chinese tech companies, including new entrants like DeepSeek, are trading at significant discounts due to geopolitical concerns and weaker global demand,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo. “DeepSeek’s rise could spark renewed investor interest in undervalued Chinese AI companies, providing an alternative growth story.” The news also sparked a huge change in investments in non-technology companies on Wall Street. Energy companies had been traded up significantly higher in recent years because of the massive amounts of electricity needed to power AI data centers. But they all plummeted Monday. Constellation Energy (CEG), the company behind the planned revival of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant for powering AI, fell 21% Monday. Competitors like Vistra (VST) fell 28% and GE Vernova (GEV) was down 21%. Futures for natural gas, used to power electricity generators, tumbled 5.9%. Oil fell more than 2%. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also tumbled. One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely. So the market selloff may be a bit overdone — or perhaps investors were looking for an excuse to sell. “Time will tell if the DeepSeek threat is real — the race is on as to what technology works and how the big Western players will respond and evolve,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. “Markets had gotten too complacent on the beginning of the Trump 2.0 era and may have been looking for an excuse to pull back — and they got a great one here.” The industry is also taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company. Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor – a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that – for now – still require tremendous infrastructure investments. “Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

Beginning Monday, several policies are returning to Starbucks’ locations in United States and Canada — part of CEO Brian Niccol’s Herculean task of reversing sales and traffic declines at the struggling institution. The chain is bringing back condiment bars after they were taken away during theheight of the Covid-19 pandemic, and baristas will return to hand-writing customers’ names on their cups using Sharpies. Both changes are part of Starbucks’ plans to reboot the coffee house vibe that’s diminished in recent years. The return of milk and sugar stations are a small step for Starbucks, but it represents something much bigger for the world’s largest coffee chain. It’s an acknowledgment that Starbucks went too far in overloading its baristas with endless ways to prepare drinks. Niccol said in a previous earnings call that “our customers are asking for it and our baristas are saying it would help them deliver the speed of service that they want to provide.” The return of personalizing cups is also a Niccol directive, who previously said the chain has to“track down” 200,000 Sharpiesto make it happen. Starbucksreleased a new TV advertisementpromoting the personal touches that comes with handwritten notes, as well as a slight name update to “Starbucks Coffee Company.” (The company didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment about the branding change.) Also, free refills on some “for here” orders are expanding to all of its paying customers — a perk that was once reserved for members of its loyalty program. They will be served in ceramic mugs or a clean personal cup brought from home and are eligible for hot or iced coffee and tea orders. In addition, Starbucks isn’t letting anyone hang out or use its restrooms without making a purchase. Related articleStarbucks ends its ‘open-door’ policies The company said in a press release Monday it heard from customers and employees that “access to comfortable seating and a clean, safe environment is critical to getting back to the Starbucks they know and love” resulting in the company scrapping its open-door policy. Other tweaks include a ban on panhandling, discrimination, consuming outside alcohol and vaping, according to thepolicy posted online. Employees have received training on the new rules. Starbucks (SBUX) stock is up 7% over the past 12 months, but the company has posted three straight quarters of slumping sales and declining customer visits. Global sales at stores open at least a year fell 7% last quarter and the number of customer transactions sinking by 8%. Investors will see how Niccol’s turnaround plan is doing after the bell on Tuesday, when the company releases its next earnings report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Wondering why you’re already struggling with thatNew Year’s resolution? A new study suggests that forming healthynew habitstakes a lot longer than we thought. For years, popular wisdom has held that it takes just 21 days to add a new habit to your daily routine. But according to recentresearchfrom the University of South Australia (UniSA), new habits typically take around two months to engrain, and can take up to almost a year. The researchers reached this conclusion after conducting a meta-analysis of 20 earlier studies, published between 2008 and 2023, and involving more than 2,600 participants. These studies measured habitual behavior to find an overall trend in the length of time taken for healthy habits to form. Habits included exercise, drinking water, taking vitamins and flossing. Related articleHow to restart our New Year’s resolutions The researchers hope their findings will motivate people to stick with trying to form healthy habits even if it is taking longer than expected. “I think the main thing is that it helps people set realistic expectations,” Ben Singh, research fellow at UniSA Allied Health & Human Performance and co-author of the study, told CNN. “It’s not often a quick fix.” The study, published in the journal Healthcare, found that the median time taken to form new, healthy habits was 59-66 days, but it could take as long as 335 days. Singh stressed that how long it takes to form healthy habits is different for each person and depends on what the habit is. “Sometimes we found that the simple behaviors, (like) if someone wanted to start flossing each day, might take someone a week to get into their routine,” Singh explained, “but more complex behaviors such as changing someone’s diet and physical activity can take a lot longer.” He explained that the 21-days mythstems from the 1960 book “Psycho-Cybernetics”by plastic surgeon Maxwell Maltz, in which the author observed that his patients typically took around 21 days to get used to their new appearance following surgery. Singh said people held onto the idea of a “quick fix” as motivation. So, is there a danger that the new research will make them more reluctant to try to establish new habits in the first place? “There is the possibility that it will put people off and maybe discourage them and demotivate them,” said Singh. “(But) some people (who) may think that it’s going to take them 21 days, but then after 21 days they’re still struggling, then at least this research and this evidence provides people with some realistic benchmarks that they can follow.” Singh said the study also offers specific tips for forming healthy habits. “If (people) want to start eating healthier or exercising more, then integrating those new habits in the mornings tends to be more effective than trying to integrate them later on in the day,” he said, “because people tend to lose motivation or get busier later in the days, (so) they’re less likely to follow that behavior.” For example, if you want to get into a habit of eating more fruit, Singh recommends having an apple with a morning coffee. Benjamin Gardner, director of the Habit Application and Theory (HabitAT) Group at the University of Surrey, England, suggested the results of the study should be interpreted carefully. “It is important to urge caution around the idea that people either ‘have a habit’ or ‘don’t have a habit’, which is implicit in this study,” Gardner, who was not involved in the research, told CNN. “In reality, habit varies on a continuum – in other words, habit becomes stronger over time, rather than reaching a magic point at which it is ‘fully formed.’” Gardner said the best way to form a habit is through what is known as “context-consistent repetition,” identifying a situation that you encounter regularly, and then doing your chosen behavior each time you encounter that situation. More research is still needed to find out how successful people were in sustaining the new habits examined in the study, Singh noted. “A lot of the research was quite short term,” he said. “We really need a lot more longer-term research. So (if) someone has successfully changed their habits and improved their behavior after 12 weeks, are they still following that behavior 12 months down the track?” The overall message of the research is clear, though: If you want to make 2025 your year of healthy habits, be patient – the new you may well make an appearance in a matter of months rather than weeks. © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "content": "Follow: Anyone not familiar with the “prosperity toss,” a beloved Lunar New Year culinary tradition, could be forgiven for thinking they’ve just walked in on the world’s strangest food fight. It is, admittedly, an unusual scene. As a tablecloth is laid, diners stand around the table, hovering close, chopsticks gripped tightly in their hands. As each ingredient is added to a plate, auspicious words are chanted — first come the vegetables, then the slices of raw fish, followed by the dressing and, finally, garnishes such as nuts or wonton crisps. Related articleA 2025 guide to Lunar New Year as we slither into the Year of the Snake Everyone then digs into the salad at once, tossing the ingredients higher and higher while shouting louder and louder — all in the hopes of bringing good fortune for the coming year. “Some of the most popular auspicious phrases includeHuat ah!(meaning prosperity),Xin nian kuai le!(Happy New Year), andDa ji da li!(great luck and great fortune),” says Paul Liew, third-generation owner ofKeng Eng Kee Seafood (KEK), a Michelin Guide-recommended no-frills food stall in Singapore that serves a wide range of delicious home-style Chinese dishes. “The higher the toss, the more blessings you’re wishing for. But it’s more about the spirit of the celebration than a competition.” The prosperity toss, also known asyusheng/yee sang(translated as raw fish) orlou sang/lo hei(stir up), is incredibly popular in Singapore and Malaysia. Both claim to have invented the modern version of this tradition. The truth remains murky. “The prosperity toss, oryusheng, is a dish that’s closely associated with Lunar New Year celebrations here in Singapore,” says Liew. Related articleThe complicated story behind longevity noodles, a popular Lunar New Year dish “The Singapore version ofyusheng, which I had read and been told, originated in the 1960s in Singapore, by the four chefs of Chinese cuisine during that era, known as the ‘Four Heavenly Kings.’ ” These four prominent Chinese chefs — Sin Leong, Hooi Kok Wai, Tham Yui Kai and Lau Yoke Pui — are credited with establishing Cantonese cuisine in Singapore in the 1960s and 1970s. It’s said that they decided to add seven kinds of colorful chopped vegetables as well as a sweet and sour plum and tangerine sauce to raw slices of fish — a traditional delicacy brought over from China with the diaspora — to create the prosperity toss that’s known and loved today. In Malaysia, meanwhile, many people claim the dish was invented by chefs, inspired by traditional fish noodles, at a restaurant called Loke Ching Kee in Seremban City in the 1940s. “From what I believe, the dish comes from the Cantonese people in Malaysia,” says Aaron Khor, head chef and co-founder ofFifty Tales, a Malaysian Chinese restaurant that serves homemade noodles during the day and modern/casual Malaysian-Chinese cuisine at night. “Usually served in big banquet restaurants,lou sangis enjoyed with a large group of people, usually 10 or more.” That these two Singaporean and Malaysian chefs don’t agree on the origin of the prosperity toss will come as little surprise to those familiar with both nations’ passion for food. The pair met at an event in Bangkok in 2024 and immediately clicked, as both of their restaurants specialize in Chinese comfort cuisine. Yet, when it comes to the origins of the prosperity toss, neither will back down. “It’s a fun topic that often sparks friendly debates among foodies from both countries,” says Liew. “While there are different claims, I personally believe that the modern version of the prosperity toss as we know it today was popularized here in Singapore.” Khor adds that such debates aren’t unusual, and it’s all good-natured. “It is the same question as things likerendang, laksaand many other dishes that both Singapore and Malaysia share,” he says. “While it does matter to know where it originated, it’s also (important) to remember that both countries wereonce a single countryand are located next to each other. (The debate) will never end in my opinion. And personally, it’s exciting to see how both countries have different ways of doing things.” Liew agrees. “What’s more important is how it’s celebrated and enjoyed by people today. It’s the shared experience that matters most,” he adds. Related articleI’ve eaten at the world’s best restaurants. One of the best things I’ve ever tasted cost $2 from a tiny takeout store While prosperity toss is customarily served on the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, also known as “The People’s Birthday” (orRenri), many festival revelers toss their plate of vegetables and raw fish slices whenever they have a chance over the holiday period. Liew says that his father first introduced Yusheng to KEK’s menu in Singapore in the 1990s. Their version has evolved over time, but the core ingredients remain — thinly sliced raw fish with shredded vegetables such as carrots and turnips, and a range of condiments such as jellyfish, preserved ginger, peanuts and sesame seeds. But the secret to a good toss lies in the sauce, and most restaurants have their own in-house recipe. “A good prosperity toss is all about balance between the textures of the vegetables, the crunchiness of the peanuts, and the amount ofyushengsauce (which is produced in our kitchen),” he says. Liew, who manages the front-of-house with his family while his brother Wayne Liew helms the kitchen, says the tossing part isn’t just for fun, but flavor as well. A good toss allows the shredded vegetables to release their moisture, which binds well with the sauce. Meanwhile, Khor says his young restaurant — co-founded with his two friends Aaron Phua and Bimmy Soh — started serving prosperity toss during last year’s Lunar New Year period. Named “Fifty Tales Yee Sang,” it’s made with fresh vegetables such as radishes, carrots, white turnips, cucumbers, red cabbage, pickles and fried yam, then topped with an in-house sauce of salted calamansi (a type of citrus fruit), guava, five spice and plum. “Last year, we did theyee sangwith cured raw snapper. This year, we’ve taken things up a notch by serving it with abalone,” says Khor. These days, it’s being served far beyond Malaysia and Singapore Chinese restaurants around the world — from San Francisco to Hong Kong — have started embracing the trend and offer their own versions of the prosperity toss during Lunar New Year. For instance, Hong Kong-Canadian chef Susur Lee serves Singapore slaw, inspired by the prosperity toss, all year round at his restaurant in Toronto. It’s one of the most iconic dishes on his menu. His version comprises two dozen ingredients, including deep-fried taro noodles, fried vermicelli, perilla leaves and a fruity dressing. Related articleMSG is the most misunderstood ingredient of the century. That’s finally changing Nowadays, the prosperity toss continues to be an extremely significant ritual for Lunar New Year in Singapore and Malaysia, with both chefs saying the tradition remains popular among younger generations, too. “Without it to begin the meal, we wouldn’t be celebrating Chinese New Year,” says Khor. “Every gathering, every dinner with our families during this festive season must include the prosperity toss.” So what’s his personal record? The chef says he once ate three prosperity tosses in a single day. “I mean I like salads, but not that many,” Khor says with a laugh. Liew is also quick to stress that it’s so much more than just a dish. “It’s a ritual that brings people together, symbolizing unity… and the welcoming of a fresh start,” he says.

Depends who you ask Even his father, known for his stern and serious demeanor, joins in the messy tradition. “It’s something that’s very important to him, even if he didn’t show it in a loud way,” Liew says. “He would join in, though he’d definitely be a bit more reserved with his tossing… I think I see him get more animated with the grandkids around (nowadays). The tossing is such a joyful tradition, and it brings out a different side of everyone, no matter how serious they are.” The only downside to this joyous food fight? The cleanup. “It can get pretty messy, especially if there are a lot of people at the table,” says Liew, laughing. “The ingredients can go flying, and sometimes there’s a bit of a scramble to make sure everyone gets involved. These ingredients may even be found on ceiling fans at the end of our meal service. “But that’s part of the fun. The higher you toss, the greater the fortune, so it’s always a good laugh to see who can toss their ingredients the highest. It’s all in good spirits, of course.” Enable Javascript to view this contentThis is usually found in your web browser's settings © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

        "content": "Follow: Denmark said on Monday it would spend 14.6 billion Danish kroner ($2.05 billion) boosting its military capabilities in the Arctic – a decision that comes amid continuing furor following US President Donald Trump’s renewed interest in controllingGreenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. The agreement aims to “improve capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region,” according to a statement from Denmark’s Ministry of Defense. “At the same time, support to Allies and NATO’s efforts in the Arctic and North Atlantic is essential to strengthening overall security and defense,” the statement added. As part of the investment package, Denmark will fund three new Arctic naval vessels, two long-range drones with the ability to conduct surveillance over large areas and increased admission to Arctic basic military training. Related articleHow the ‘Trump factor’ now looms over international affairs “We must face the fact that there are serious challenges regarding security and defense in the Arctic and North Atlantic,” Troels Lund Poulsen, Denmark’s minister of defense, said. “For this reason, we must strengthen our presence in the region. That is the objective of this agreement, which paves the way for further initiatives already this year.” Vivian Motzfeldt, Denmark’s minister of statehood and foreign affairs, added that “Greenland is facing a changing security landscape.” The announcement comes after theEuropean Unionsaid it was “not negotiating” on the sovereignty of Greenland Asked if the EU should negotiate the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Denmark, EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said: “No, we are not negotiating on Greenland. Of course, we are supporting our member state Denmark and its autonomous region, Greenland.” Trump, who took office on January 20, has previously described US control of Greenland as an “absolute necessity.” Both Greenland and Denmark have said previously that the island is not for sale. The question to Kallas on Monday came after she told a press conference that Europe needed to “close ranks” as the “United States shifts to a more transactional approach” in its foreign relations. She told the same conference that the US was an “important ally” and that America and Europe were “very much interlinked,” but added that “it’s not like somebody is telling us what to do and we are following” and warned against further speculation over Greenland. “We shouldn’t also go into speculation about the ‘what ifs,’ because this is not the situation right now,” she said. Related videoDanish official explains his colorful language directed at Trump Greenland has long been seen as key to US national security interests, particularly to repel a possible Russian attack. But during Trump’s first term, national security officials were particularly concerned about China’s activities in the Arctic, which at that point were a relatively new threat, a former senior Trump adviser told CNN. Still, US and Danish officials have said they don’t understand the incoming president’s obsession with acquiring Greenland, which Trump has called “an absolute necessity,” particularly because the US already has a decades-old defense agreement with the territory that has allowed the US to build up a significant military presence — including troops and radar systems — on the world’s largest island. Officials in both Greenland and Denmark have come out strongly against Trump’s desire to obtain the island – though multiple Danish officialshave told CNNthey fear the president is now more serious about the idea than when he floated it in his first term. Despite those rebuttals, the debate over Greenland’s future has been stirred up by growing speculation over its independence movement. In his New Year’s speech, Greenland’s prime minister said the island should break free from “the shackles of colonialism” – though the speech did not mention the United States.

        "content": "Follow: A California woman was sentenced Monday to more than three years in prison in a long-running case over a business that helped pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States to deliver babies who automatically became American citizens. US District Judge R. Gary Klausner gave Phoebe Dong a 41-month sentence and ordered her immediately taken into custody from his federal court in Los Angeles. Dong and her husband were convicted in September of conspiracy and money laundering through their company, USA Happy Baby. The sentencing came as birthright citizenship has been thrust into the spotlight in the US with the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. Since taking office, Trump issued an executive order to narrow the definition of birthright citizenship, a move quickly blocked by a federal judge who called it “blatantly unconstitutional.” Dong and her husband, Michael Liu,were among more than a dozen people charged in an Obama-era crackdownon so-called “birth tourism” schemes that helped Chinese women hide their pregnancies while traveling to the US to give birth. Such businesses have long operated in various states catering to people from China, Russia, Nigeria and elsewhere. Related articleHow far Chinese moms will go to have US babies Under the 14th Amendment,any child born in the United States is an American citizen. Many have seen these trips as a way to help their children secure a US college education and a better future – especially since the tourists themselves can apply for permanent residency once the children turn 21. During her sentencing hearing, Dong wiped away tears as she recalled growing up without siblings due to China’s strict “one-child ” policy and told the court that the Chinese government forced her mother to have an abortion. Moving to the US was challenging, she said, but Dong grew hopeful after having children of her own and saw she could help Chinese women who want to have additional children in California. “I don’t want to lose my kids,” she told the court. “I hope you can give me fair judgment. I will take all my responsibility.” Federal prosecutors sought a more than five-year sentence for Dong and argued that she and Liu helped more than 100 pregnant Chinese women travel to the US. They said the pair worked with others to coach women on how to trick customs officials by flying into airports believed to be more lax while wearing loose-fitting clothing to hide their pregnancies. “For tens of thousands of dollars each, defendant helped her numerous customers deceive US authorities and buy US citizenship for their children,” prosecutors said in court filings. They declined to comment after the sentencing. Related articleChina’s one-child policy hangover: Scarred women dismiss Beijing’s pro-birth agenda In December, Liu was also sentenced to 41 months in prison. Dong’s lawyer, John McNicholas, asked that she be allowed to serve her term after Liu completes his sentence because of their three children. The youngest is 13. Federal prosecutor Kevin Fu agreed to the delay but Klausner refused and had her taken into custody immediately. Dong removed a necklace and gave it to a family member before she was led away. The USA Happy Baby case was part of a broader probe into businesses that helped Chinese women travel to give birth in California. The operator of another business is believed to have fled to China, McNicholas wrote in court filings, whileanother was sentenced in 2019 to 10 months in prisonafter pleading guilty to conspiracy and visa fraud for running the company known as “You Win USA.” McNicholas said he feels Dong was given a much longer sentence because the government and Klausner blame her for the babies that were born US citizens. That, he said, is unrelated to the allegations that she and Liu helped women travel to the United States to give birth. “Our position was these children are born in America. They’re citizens,” McNicholas said, adding that Dong will appeal. “Implicitly, he’s saying being born here is not enough.” © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

        "content": "Follow: A magnitude 3.8 earthquake rattled parts of New England on Monday morning, with shaking felt from Boston to Portland, Maine, the US Geological Survey said. The quake was centered about 7 miles southeast of York Harbor, Maine, and struck at a depth of about 8 miles, the USGS said. Earlier, the USGS estimated the magnitude was 3.9. The York County Emergency Management Agency urged residents not to call 911 unless they needed urgent help. “We can confirm that a small earthquake occurred at 10:22am. Shaking was felt countywide,”York County EMAposted on X. “No risk remains to the public. To assist our dispatch centers, please DO NOT call 911 unless it is an emergency.” The New England quake “reminds us that earthquakes are unusual but not unheard of along the Atlantic Seaboard,”USGS Earthquakes postedon X. The tremor probably isn’t related to the magnitude 2.4 quake felt in northern New Jersey and the New York City metro area Friday afternoon, USGS seismologist Susan Hough told CNN. Related articleEverything you need to prepare for earthquakes, wildfires and tornadoes, according to experts The quakes seem to be too far away from each other to be directly related, with about 230 miles separating their epicenters, Hough said. She said the tremors are probably among the random, small quakes that occasionally impact the East Coast. “The Atlantic Seaboard is considered a passive plate boundary, as opposed to the active plate boundary on the West Coast” – so the quakes tend to be smaller and much less frequent on the East Coast, Hough said. But quakes such as Monday’s 3.8 magnitude tremor and the more significantmagnitude 4.8 quakethat rattled much of metro New York in April can lead to more shaking in the region. “Statistically, earthquake activity always increases the chances of more activity – you’ve disturbed the crust,” Hough said. Moderately damaging earthquakes strike the New England region every few decades, and smaller tremors are felt about twice a year, the USGS said. The most recent New England earthquake to cause moderate damage was a magnitude 5.6 quake that rocked central New Hampshire in 1940. CNN’s Ronnie Glassberg contributed to this report.

        "content": "Follow: Before she died of typhus at 15 inside the German concentration camp Bergen-Belsen, Anne Frank livedjust over two yearsinside a secret 45-square meter (484-square foot)annex atop an Amsterdam home with her parents, sister and four others, all hiding from the Nazis. That space — one of the most famous dwellings in history, thanks to Frank’s best-selling published diary and subsequent plays and films — can now be explored remotely in New York. Having toured both, I was no less moved by the recreation. Anne Frank The Exhibition brings you into their world and puts it in larger context. From January 27 (International Holocaust Remembrance Day) through April 30, visitors to New York’s Center for Jewish History near Union Square can take a self-guided tour of a detailed, full-scale recreation of the Amsterdam dwelling and get very close to its residents’ personal belongings and related exhibits. It’s a moving journey that brings the massive, horrific scale of the Holocaust — in which approximately six million European Jews were murdered — down to the vibrant if cloistered life and shared experiences of just a handful of them. Frank’s book, translated into more than 70 languages with over 30 million copies sold so far, reads like a nonfiction play at times. We get whole passages of absorbing dialogue, soliloquized observations, some stage direction and plenty of tense, claustrophobic scenes. And like some plays, the set is itself a character. Reading Frank’s famous diary conjures in the mind, as many readers know, a visual map of the annex’s layout. Related articleThe Netherlands unveils its first national Holocaust monument Comparing one’s imagined annex is part of the appeal of visiting Frank’s actual secret annex home in Amsterdam, which has been open to visitors since 1960. When you visit, you may be struck by the size — bigger or smaller than you thought — or of the life-or-death significance of their hidden entrance behind a moving bookcase, or in the small universally human ephemera on display. So much life was lived there, even in seclusion. Now you can have that experience in Manhattan, for the first time outside Amsterdam. It’s a unique opportunity to make Frank’s story accessible to US schoolchildren. The meticulous recreation is bookended, so to speak, by exhibits. One displays photos and the original objects belonging to the family (handwritten notes, luggage, a desk, a transit pass, etc), from the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. Another exhibit recounts the final chapters for the Annex’s residents and others. It’s highly immersive in video, audio, photos and maps. In one room you walk on a glass floor with a bas-relief map of Europe under your shoes, red-orange flags marking the major Nazi concentration camps. The rooms themselves are a vivid snapshot of both time and place. There’s a Monopoly-type stock exchange board game called Het Beursspel in the middle of the table in the kitchen/dining area. A sock with yarn needles is suspended in mid-darn. As the audio loop explains, Anne shared a room with an older man who wasn’t a family member, and she put on their walls photos of early 1940s celebrities (Hollywood and royalty) to cheer the place up a bit. And then you look down at Anne’s desk and there it is, a child’s journal – plaid, fuzzy and with a lock. It’s a facsimile, but that book, this room, is what Anne saw, and it’s not a photo, not virtual. Related articleFrom true crimes to terror: When is ‘dark tourism’ too dark? I didn’t read “Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl” as a school-age kid. I hadn’t even read it when I toured the actual house in Amsterdam in my late 20s. The story is famous enough without needing to. Instead, I read the surprisingly mature and bittersweet volume a few years ago, during the Covid lockdown. Not that the fear of that deadly virus was the same threat level as the Nazis. But there were still parallels in terms of isolation, not going to school or work, and the risk of human contact beyond the bubble of one’s family. But what really struck me was Frank’s clear, ambitious and unintentionally prescient hopes for herself as a famous writer. As I toured her temporary home this time in New York, I recalled one of the few quotes I wrote down for myself when I read the book. “I don’t want to have lived in vain like most people,” Frank wrote. “I want to be useful or bring enjoyment to all people, even those I’ve never met. I want to go on living even after my death!” As heartbreakingly early as that death was, she got her beautiful wish. You can buy tickets atAnneFrankExhibit.org. Audio guides are included with entry.

Matthew Huttle, 42, of Hobart was killed Sunday by a Jasper County sheriff’s deputy, authorities said. State police are investigating. They said the deputy tried to arrest Huttle when “an altercation took place between the suspect and the officer, which resulted in the officer firing his weapon and fatally wounding the suspect. “The investigation also shows that during the traffic stop, the suspect was in possession of a firearm,” state police added. No other details were released. Authorities didn’t say what might have prompted the traffic stop. “Our condolences go out to the family of the deceased as any loss of life is traumatic to those that were close to Mr. Huttle,” Sheriff Patrick Williamson said. Nick Barnes, an attorney who was representing Huttle in pending motor vehicle cases in Lake County, said he didn’t know the circumstances of the shooting. “I plan to find out a lot more about it,” Barnes said. In 2023, Huttle was sentenced to six months in custody after pleading guilty to entering a restricted building, the US Capitol. He had traveled with his uncle to Washington to attend the January 6, 2021, pro-Trump rally. Huttle was inside the Capitol for 16 minutes and recorded it on video. “He is not a true believer in any political cause,” defense attorney Andrew Hemmer said in a court filing. “He instead went to the rally because he thought it would be a historic moment and he had nothing better to do after getting out of jail” for a driving offense. © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "content": "Follow: The Senate confirmed Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary on Monday, elevating the hedge fund manager to the new administration’s top financial job as President Donald Trump forges ahead on an ambitious economic agenda. The vote was 68-29. As head of the Treasury, 62-year-old Bessent facespressure to address the federal debt limit andwork with congressional Republicans to extend Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He’ll also have to contend with Trump’s plans to enact tariffs on goods coming in from Mexico, Canada and China, whichposes risks for the American economy. A steady US economy makes Bessent’s work a bit easier, including pushing the president’s priorities. His arrival comes on the back of strong growth and a low, 4.1% unemployment rate, although inflation continues to hover above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. During his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Bessent voiced support for making the 2017 tax cuts permanent andargued that the issuewith the federal budget is spending, and not revenues. He also claimed that Trump’s economic plans would lower consumer costs and boost wages. His “3-3-3” economic plan includes bringing the federal budget deficit down to 3%, achieving 3% GDP and producing 3 million more barrels of oil a day by the end of Trump’s second term. Bessent, who advised Trump on economic policy during his campaign, is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management. He previously was the chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management, a hedge fund started by Democratic megadonor George Soros. Bessent is the first out gay Treasury secretary and the first LGBTQ Senate-confirmed Cabinet member in a Republican administration, according toThe Associated Press. When Trump named Bessent as his pick for Treasury secretary in November, he touted him as a “strong advocate of the America First Agenda,” and said that he would “usher in a new Golden Age for the United States, as we fortify our position as the World’s leading Economy, Center of Innovation and Entrepreneurialism, Destination for Capital, while always, and without question, maintaining the US Dollar as the Reserve Currency of the World.” CNN’s Bryan Mena contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "content": "Thousands of wildfirestear through southern Italyevery year, fueled by scorching temperatures and the hot, dry, sirocco winds that sweep in from the Sahara. The climate crisis is pouring gasoline on these blazes, but the Mafia may be lighting the spark, according to new research. While hot, dry windsprime the land for Italy’s ferocious fires, it’s humans who start them. More than halfare set intentionally, officials say, for reasons ranging from land clearing to personal vendettas. As fires cluster in areas where mafia control is strong, there is an increased scrutiny on these criminal groups. The Mafia is “weaponizing” fire in the region for control and financial gain, said UC Berkeley researcher Lauren Pearson. She spent months speaking to prosecutors, the police, environmental groups and locals in Sicily, where Mafia groups are active. The way mafias operate — in the shadows and with high levels of control over communities — means hard data linking them to fires is fiendishly hard to pin down, Pearson told CNN. But evidence points to a clear connection between organized crime and wildfires, according to her recentstudy. Southern Italy has always had wildfires, but recent summers have been devastating. Sicily endured more than 8,000 fires in 2021 as temperatures spiked to120 degrees Fahrenheit. They were so severe, the regional Anti-Mafia Commission conducted aninvestigationinto the potential criminal causes behind them. It found perfect fire weather combined with inaccessible forested terrain helped set the stage for fast, uncontrollable fires. But criminal activities “constitute the most dangerous factor,” itsreportsaid. These criminal activities are not just a Mafia business, said Laura Biffi, who works for the environmental non-profit Legambiente, which has been documenting the Mafia’s ecological crimes for decades. Experts say there is a “fire industry” in southern Italy, she told CNN, because there are so many people involved. Fires are set by seasonal workers eager to prolong firefighting contracts, farmers who want to clear forest for grazing, protestors or people with vendettas. But even when the Mafia is not directly responsible, it’s unimaginable anyone would deliberately start a fire in Mafia-controlled territory without its permission, Biffi said. In 2023, more than half of Italy’s nearly 3,700 fires occurred in Sicily, Puglia, Calabria and Campania, regions where southern Italy’s four major historical Mafias have their roots, said Vincenzo Linarello, the founder of GOEL, a network of farmers fighting Mafia influence. Repeated fires in those areas are “either an attack on mafias or they are the perpetrators. It’s a matter of simple logic,” said Sergio Nazzaro, a journalist and former spokesman for the president of the Anti-Mafia Parliamentary Commission. The Mafia’s use of fires tends to have two main aims: power and profit. Fire is money, Nazzaro told CNN. It creates an emergency that has to be solved and profits for the companies that step in. There are contracts for firefighting, clean-up operations and rebuilding. The Mafia is a multilayered criminal enterprise, he said, that goes “from the labor force that sets the fire to the concession to build on burned land.” There is also evidence Mafia organizations may be using fire to procure land to broker deals for solar and wind infrastructure, with the hope of tapping into clean-energy transition funds, Pearson said. One farmer, whose testimony appears in the Anti-Mafia Commission report, spoke of being approached by solar panel companies after his land had been burned. There’s a cruel irony at play, Pearson said. The Mafia appears to be both weaponizing climate change, which iswhipping up more destructive fires, as well as trying to exploit funding intended to address it. The Italian Mafia “are masters at figuring out how to illegally garner new funds,” she said. As well as using fire for financial gain, experts say it also fits with the Mafia’s culture of violence. It’s a weapon of “intimidation and terror,” Pearson said, “a way to declare that the land is still theirs.” Deliberate fire setting is very hard to tackle. Proving a fire was started by arson is easy and the motivation is often implicitly obvious, Nazzaro said. “The real problem is identifying the perpetrators and especially the principals.” There is currently “no concrete evidence” of Mafia involvement infires, said Andrea Zoppi, deputy prosecutor in the Prosecutors Office of Palermo in Sicily. Although there is evidence that forest fires often lead to land speculation, he told CNN. Italy has a number of laws designed to disincentivize arson by barring grazing or development for several years after land has been burned. But these laws can be hard to implement, Pearson said, they require a lot of tracking and monitoring. Pietro Ciulla, World Wildlife Fund Italy’s delegate for Sicily, says the big issue in parts of Italy is a lack of strategy to counter fires, with resources spent on firefighting but not on working out how to prevent them and to reforest the land. This is likely to make it “easier for the Mafia to infiltrate and do business,” he told CNN. As the planet heats up, the Mafia may find it easier to use fire for its ends, said Pearson. “There is a weaponization happening of climate change.” Enable Javascript to view this contentThis is usually found in your web browser's settings © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY As theDallas Cowboysenter their 66th season in 2025, they'll welcome a new head coach for just the 10th time in franchise history. Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach on Friday, replacing Mike McCarthy after five seasons. Schottenheimer was elevated despite never serving as a head coach previously and not calling plays for the Cowboys in his three years as an assistant. Owner Jerry Jones' track record of picking head coaches has been mixed. Seven have winning records and two won Super Bowls, but the latter two are also the only Cowboys coaches to reach a conference championship game. Dallas' title-game drought is now at 29 seasons, the longest in the NFC. Will Schottenheimer get America's Team over the hump? That remains to be seen. For now, let's rank the nine coaches in Cowboys history. Record: 15-33 Campo oversaw one of the few bad eras that the Cowboys have had in their long, storied history. The club had been on a downward trajectory before Campo took over, but bottomed out in Campo's first season. Troy Aikman was sidelined for multiple games with concussions, while standout wide receiver Joey Galloway suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 1. Dallas finished with a 5-11 record, its worst in more than a decade. Aikman then retired before the 2001 season, and Dallas again went 5-11. Dave Campo is the only head coach in Cowboys history to have a losing record (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) Those struggles continued into Campo's third season, when the Cowboys lost their 2002 season opener to theHouston Texans… who were playing their first game as a franchise. Emmitt Smith set the NFL rushing record later that year in what would be his final season with the Cowboys, who lost their final four games to register their third straight 5-11 campaign. Campo was fired soon after, finishing as the only coach in Cowboys history to have a losing record and never post a winning season or reach the playoffs. Record: 18-14 Gailey preceded Campo on the Cowboys' downswing in the late 1990s. Though he coached the team to the postseason, that was all he was able to accomplish, losing in the first round both times. In some regard, Gailey briefly revived the Cowboys following their Super Bowl seasons earlier in the decade. He led them to a 10-6 season and a division title in his first year on the job in 1998, which was a four-win improvement from the season prior. But Gailey was part of an off-field decision that wound up haunting the Cowboys for years. He advised the team not to take Randy Moss with its first-round pick in the 1998 draft. Dallas instead selected defensive end Greg Ellis, who enjoyed a solid career with the Cowboys. Moss, of course, went on to become one of the greatest receivers of all time. Adding insult to injury, Moss caught three touchdowns against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving in his rookie season. Record: 85-67 Garrett's tenure as Dallas' head coach technically started in 2010, when he became the interim coach upon Wade Phillips' midseason ouster. After the Cowboys went 5-3 in the second half of the season, the former Cowboys backup quarterback had the interim tag removed ahead of the 2011 season. What followed was three straight 8-8 campaigns, with Dallas losing a win-or-go-home game in Week 17 of each season. Jason Garrett was the first former Cowboys player to become the team's head coach. (Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images) The Cowboys finally made the postseason under Garrett in 2014, going 12-4 to win the division. They then won their first playoff game in five years, but their playoff run ended in controversy. Dallas fell to theGreen Bay Packersin the divisional round when a long pass toDez Bryant was ruled incompleteafter a review late in the fourth quarter. That season was enough to earn Garrett an extension, however. His best year came in 2016, with rookie duoDak Prescottand Ezekiel Elliott sparking the Cowboys to a 13-3 record and the top seed in the NFC. Garrett won Coach of the Year, only for Dallas to suffer another devastating postseason defeat at the hands of Green Bay. After rallying from an 18-point deficit, the Cowboys lost on a field goal at the buzzer. Garrett won another division title and a playoff game two years later, but it was sandwiched between two seasons in which the Cowboys missed the playoffs. Dallas had just one losing season in nine years under Garrett, who was dismissed after going 8-8 again in 2019. Record: 34-22 Phillips helped the Cowboys achieve their first (albeit, little) playoff success since the end of their dynasty days in the 1990s. It came after another painful playoff loss, though. In Phillips' first season as head coach, the Cowboys had a strong regular season. They went 13-3 and earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC before the New York Giants upset the Cowboys in the divisional round in 2007. A year later, Dallas missed the postseason after dropping its regular-season finale to thePhiladelphia Eagles. The Cowboys returned to the playoffs in 2009, winning the NFC East in the final week of the regular season before thrashing the Eagles for a second straight week to pick up their first playoff win in 13 seasons. TheMinnesota Vikings, however, gave the Cowboys a similar beatdown a week later. Phillips never rebounded from that loss. Dallas opened the 2010 season 1-7, prompting Jones to fire him and ending a 3.5-year tenure that showed plenty of promise, but never lived up to it. Record: 49-35 The recently departed McCarthy arguably brought the most stability to the Cowboys in three decades, giving Dallas a pretty high floor when Dak Prescott was healthy. After a 6-10 season in which Prescott was sidelined with a compound fracture in his ankle, McCarthy coached the Cowboys to three straight 12-5 campaigns. But McCarthy ran into the same problem that every Cowboys coach since the middle of the 1990s has faced: winning in the postseason. In the 2021 season,the Cowboys called a quarterback drawthat ran out the final seconds in their 23-17 loss to theSan Francisco 49ersin the opening round of the playoffs. A year later, they beat Tom Brady and theTampa Bay Buccaneerson the road, but they narrowly fell to the 49ers again in the divisional round. The 2023 season might have been the Cowboys' best chance to win a Super Bowl since the ‘90s. Prescott finished second in MVP voting after McCarthy took over offensive playcalling duties, and Dallas' defense played at a high level to win the NFC East. But in their postseason opener, the Cowboys fell into a huge early hole versus the Packers and were decisively defeated. Dallas is the only No. 2 seed to lose to a No. 7 seed since the playoffs were expanded in the 2020 season. Like Phillips 14 years prior, McCarthy wasn't able to bounce back from that defeat. The Cowboys made him a lame-duck head coach in 2024, and they got off to a slow start before Prescott suffered another midseason injury that knocked him out for the year. Following a 7-10 campaign, the Cowboys opted not to give McCarthy a new contract. Record: 34-30 Affectionately known as the Big Tuna, Parcells made his reputation on turning struggling franchises into winners. He didn't achieve quite the same level of success in Dallas as he did at previous stops, but he did help reset the standard for a team that had devolved into a last-place outfit. Parcells initially made the Cowboys competitive by bringing in a slew of players he'd coached previously (e.g. Vinny Testaverde, Keyshawn Johnson, Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, Aaron Glenn). Drafting the likes of Hall of Famer DeMarcus Ware and Jason Witten and signing Tony Romo as an undrafted free agent ultimately brought sustained success to the Cowboys. Bill Parcells helped turn the Cowboys back into a playoff team after a few losing seasons. (Photo by Kevin C.  Cox/Getty Images) In his final season with the team, Parcells had Romo take over for Bledsoe. The QB change sparked a run to the postseason, where Romo infamously botched a snap in the Cowboys' 21-20 wild-card loss to theSeattle Seahawks. That marked Parcells' last game ever as a head coach. Even though he never won a playoff game with the Cowboys, he left the franchise much better than he found it. Record: 40-24 Switzer was hired to provide a steady hand for the Cowboys after Jimmy Johnson's sudden resignation in the 1994 offseason. He did that, for a couple of seasons at least. Dallaswasn't able to complete the three-peatin Switzer's first season as head coach, losing to San Francisco in a battle of titans in the 1994 NFC Championship Game. A year later, though, Switzer led the Cowboys back to a Super Bowl title. They had a dominant 12-4 season before winning each of their playoff games decisively to capture their third Super Bowl title in four seasons. Barry Switzer became the second head coach to ever win a national championship and a Super Bowl title when he led the Cowboys to a victory in Super Bowl XXX. (Photo by Al Tielemans /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images) But Switzer's time in Dallas began to crumble in 1996. Some of Dallas' top stars either missed time due to suspension or injury or had their worst production over the course of their careers that year. The Cowboys still made the playoffs at 10-6 and even won a playoff game, but their upset loss at the hands of the second-yearCarolina Panthersmarked the beginning of the end for Switzer in Dallas. Switzer notably feuded with Aikman during the 1997 season and the team never fully recovered from its playoff loss a year prior, going 6-10 that year. While Switzer's time in Dallas was brief and ended poorly, he still delivered the team a title. Record: 44-36 When Jerry Jones bought the Cowboys in 1989, he tabbed Johnson as the coach to replace a franchise legend. Adding to the pressure, Johnson said he'd have the Cowboys winning the Super Bowl in five years. Instead, he did it in four. Amid a miserable 1-15 debut season in 1989, Johnson brilliantly flipped star running back Herschel Walker for numerous assets that would build Dallas' dynasty. Johnson led the Cowboys to 11 victories and a playoff win in his third season before guiding the franchise to back-to-back Super Bowls. That matched the number of titles won by his Hall of Fame predecessor and made Johnson the first head coach to ever win a national title and Super Bowl. Johnson's time in Dallas came to an abrupt end immediately following the second Super Bowl as he and Jones could no longer co-exist, but the foundation Johnson helped build kept the Cowboys in title contention for the next few years. The two finally settled their differences decades later, with Johnson being inducted into the Cowboys' Ring of Honor in 2023. Jimmy Johnson quickly lifted the Cowboys from being one of the league's bottom teams to one of the best stretches of football in the NFL's history. (Photo by Focus on Sport/Getty Images) Record: 250-162-6 Landry and his iconic fedora patrolled the Cowboys' sideline for the first 29 years of their existence, leading the franchise to a remarkable stretch of sustained consistency while winning titles. The Cowboys became known as \"America's Team\" under Landry's watch, appearing in five Super Bowls during the 1970s and winning two of them. They played in 10 of 13 NFC Championship Games from 1970 to 1982 and reached the postseason in all but one year from 1966 to 1983. Cowboys players memorably lifted Tom Landry after their win in Super Bowl XII. (Photo by Focus on Sport via Getty Images) Alas, Landry's time in Dallas didn't end on a high note, as the team missed the playoffs in each of his final three seasons. But his legacy as one of the greatest head coaches in NFL history was already etched by that point, making him the clear choice for No. 1 on this list.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY After several weeks of evaluating its playoff format,NASCARhas opted not to change it — at least for 2025. Instead, the league will create a working group to examine any potential changes for 2026. The current knockout playoff system with a one-race finale that determines the champion has been used since 2014 and was revamped slightly with the introduction of stage racing and playoff points in 2017. Joey Loganobecame the first driver who finished 15th or worse in the regular-season points to make the championship round, then won Phoenix to claim the title. Discussions about whether the regular season should mean more reached a fever pitch. And the fact thatKyle Larsonwon a series-high six races and was not in the championship round also fueled criticism of the format. \"Could we have adjusted a little bit here or there? Maybe,\" NASCAR Executive Vice President John Probst said Monday. \"But I don’t think we want to get in the habit of making small little tweaks every season for the playoffs.\" Probst, speaking at an annual preseason rules briefing with reporters, said that feedback following the championship weekend was across the board regarding whether competitors wanted change and to what extent. The working group will likely include NASCAR officials, drivers and representatives of the broadcast partners. \"We look at that as a workstream for a group of our stakeholders this year to look at it holistically,\" Probst said. \"Folks that had a lot of emotion or were really outspoken in the moment, after some time went by and we discussed it further ... we just didn’t get to a point where we feel like we have to do it. \"We heard the fans loud and clear and are looking at it actively.\" Bob Pockrass covers NASCAR for FOX Sports.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY As we hit seven weeks before the NCAA Tournament bracket is unveiled to the world on Selection Sunday, it’s weekends like this that serve as the ultimate reminder of why the marathon to March brings unexpected twists and turns along the way. Just when you think you’ve got it figured out with a team, a taste of the madness ensues. Over this past weekend inmen's college basketball, we saw a game that was the wildest I can remember watching from start to finish in quite some time — and definitely the best of the season. I have a hard time believing anything will topHouston’s92-86double-overtime win overKansasat Allen Fieldhouse. Why? For starters, the Jayhawks were up 66-60 with 1:10 left in regulation. On their home floor, being on the opposing side of that is nearly impossible to overcome. But that’s nothing compared to overtime! Kansas led 79-73 with 18 seconds left, and senior point guardDajuan Harris— a 72% free-throw shooter — at the line. He missed both free throws, the Cougars rushed down the floor and — on a day when they shot 8-for-25 from 3-point range —Emanuel Sharpburied a triple to cause a Kansas timeout. After they committed a five-second violation in regulation that gave Houston the ball back (and ended up forcing overtime because the Cougars cashed in with two free throws), Hall of Famer Bill Self wasn’t going to chance it. Well,Zeke Mayo’s pass toHunter Dickinsonwas stolen byMilos Uzan, who poked the ball toMylik Wilsonand the result was this: Beyond. Stunning. Once that second overtime was forced, you could feel the air getting sucked out of Allen Fieldhouse. The Cougars wore out the Jayhawks behind Sharp and Uzan, burying clutch triples and earning the victory that extended their winning streak to 12 consecutive games. OnlyDukehas a longer streak at 13. But the wildness of this win is amplified when you think about this: Entering Saturday, and since the 2018-19 season, Kansas was 80-1 at Allen Fieldhouse when leading at the half, with the lone defeat coming toBYUlast season. The Jayhawks were up 40-31 at the break against a Houston team that sometimes is offensively challenged, and the Cougars proceeded to go on a 13-0 run and hold Kansas scoreless for the first six minutes of the second half. WILD! But consider this from researcher Jared Berson: In other words, this was the most stunning finish to a game we’ve seen in well over a decade, if not longer, and it’s the most shocking home loss of the Bill Self era at Kansas. What Kelvin Sampson continues to do at Houston is as strong of a coaching job as any in America. He’s 22-1 in his last 23Big 12regular-season games and the only loss is at Kansas. Unreal. Five other big storylines of the week? Auburn’s53-51win overTennesseeon Saturday night at Neville Arena was an absolute war, and the 18-1 Tigers would not have won hadJohni Broomenot come back into the lineup after missing the previous two games with an ankle injury. The senior totaled 16 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks in the thrilling victory whereMiles Kellycame up clutch in with a final-minute triple. On a night when Auburn only shot 3-for-20 from 3-point land and the Volunteers pressured them with incredible defense, the Tigers’ frontcourt was the difference. Vanderbiltbasketball is back. For the first time since the 2006-07 season, the Commodores own a pair of top-10 wins in the same year. What Mark Byington has done in Year 1 on the job is really impressive in a place that’s not easy to win, as Vanderbilt followed up last Saturday’s win over Tennessee with a74-69victory overKentuckybehindJason Edwards’ 18 points and a 14-and-6 outing fromDevin McGlockton. For the Wildcats, turning the ball over 17 times coupled with a cold day forLamont Butlerled to the defeat, which knocks Kentucky out of my top 10. For Vandy, which has not made the NCAA Tournament since 2017, expect them to move up inMike Decourcy’s bracket forecastthis Tuesday, perhaps to the 9-line. Texascame up with as shocking a comeback as we’ve seen in the sport all season by rallying from 22 down in the second half to beatTexas A&M,70-69, in what is a huge rivalry victory and one that could change the momentum of the Longhorns’ campaign.ArkansastransferTramon Markdelivered the game-winner, and freshmanTre Johnsoncontinued to show why he could be a top-fiveNBADraft pick this June with 30 points. Jase Richardsoncould be the breakout star forMichigan Stateas the season continues to progress. Under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden on Saturday,he delivered a career-high 20 points, whileCoen Carrdidn’t miss a shot and finished with 14 as Tom Izzo’s Spartans won their 12th straight with an81-74victory overRutgers. If Richardson can really complementJaden Akinsand take his scoring to a more consistent level, this 17-2 Michigan State team really can dream of the program’s first Final Four since 2019. Oh, and Tom Izzo is now two wins shy of tying Bob Knight’sBig Tenwins record of 353 victories. Xavierabsolutely had to beatUConnon Saturday for its bubble hopes to stay afloat, and the Musketeers outlasted the Huskies,76-72, to improve to 13-8 on the season and 5-5 in theBig East. With wins atMarquetteand now over UConn over the past two Saturdays and no losses outside of Quadrant 1, Sean Miller’s team is in the conversation. That said, the shorthanded Huskies are so far from their normal selves withoutLiam McNeeley. At the moment, Marquette andSt. John’sare two games ahead of UConn (these three teams have yet to play one another this season) at 8-1 in the league, whileCreightonis 7-2 and UConn is 6-3. We’ll have more in a Big East reset this coming week. [Read more:Ranking the top 50 players and coaches in the country] That said, let's get to our Top 25! 1.Auburn(18-1) The Tigers have won four of their past six games on the final possession and are somehow undefeated (6-0) in theSEC, even after losing Broome for two hard games against ranked teams. I never would have thought they’d get past Tennessee in a total rock fight on a night where they went 3-for-20 from beyond the arc, but that’s the presence of Broome and an Auburn front line that was the difference. This week, they hit the road toLSUandOle Miss. Saturday's trip to Oxford, Mississippi could offer a challenge, but the Rebels’ lack of size would still cause me to take Auburn. 2.Duke(17-2) The Blue Devils showed their toughness, and Jon Scheyer made great in-game adjustments in Saturday’s63-56win atWake Forest. Facing a second-half deficit and trailing 45-39 with less than 10 minutes to play in Winston-Salem, Scheyer went to a 2-3 zone. It’s something the Blue Devils had only gone to for one possession this season, but Scheyer pulled it out of his back pocket and Wake shot 1-for-6 against it. With the defensive effort down the stretch and the greatness ofCooper Flaggthroughout the afternoon, it was enough for Duke to win its 13th consecutive game. Flagg totaled 24 points, seven rebounds and six assists, showing yet again just how in control of a game he is when he’s on the floor. After the game, Wake Forest head coach Steve Forbes called Flagg a generational talent, comparing him to the likes ofKevin DurantandKawhi Leonard. [Read more:2025 NBA Mock Draft 1.0: Debate at the top with Cooper Flagg and Dylan Harper] 3.Iowa State(17-2) I hadKeshon Gilbertas amidseason All-America team selection, butCurtis Jonesshould also be brought up when we’re talking about high honors this season. On Saturday, Jones posted a career-high 33 points to go along with seven rebounds as the Cyclones overcame a seven-point halftime deficit and outscoredArizona State43-21 in the second half to win by 15. 4.Alabama(17-3) Mark Searshad an off-night, only playing 17 minutes while shooting 0-for-5 from the floor, but the Crimson Tide still found a way past LSU,80-73, to improve to 17-3 on the year. Auburn transferAden Hollowayhad a breakout week for the Tide off the bench with 41 points in two games. 5.Houston(16-3) Mylik Wilson’s efforts in the win at Kansas should never be forgotten because he got the Cougars back into the lead in the second half. On a day whenL.J. CryerandEmanuel Sharpshot a combined 4-for-20, the fifth-year senior tallied 18 points.J’Wan Robertsand Uzan were outstanding, with Roberts going for 24-9-5 and Uzan’s line at 17-9-9 — just a rebound and an assist shy of a triple-double. Up next: atWest VirginiaonWednesday. Nothing easy in theBig 12! 6.Florida(18-2) After escapingSouth Carolinaearlier in the week with a dramatic win, the Gators showed just how great they are with a 30-point beatdown ofGeorgiaon Saturday,89-59. They locked down the Bulldogs defensively, forcing 18 turnovers, whileWalter Clayton,Alijah MartinandWill Richardcombined for 50 points, 10 assists and 10 steals while shooting over 50% from the floor. It was a perfect storm for Todd Golden’s squad. Up next: at Tennessee onSaturday. That’s a phenomenal rematch after the Gators beat the Vols by 30 onJan. 7. 7.Michigan State(17-2) The Spartans win with depth, defense, rebounding and an overall unselfishness that produced 19 assists in their victory over Rutgers on Saturday.Tre Hollomanhad six assists, while the 20-point breakout game by Richardson was so encouraging for Michigan State. The Spartans hostMinnesotabefore heading toUSCandUCLAfor a Saturday/Tuesday Los Angeles swing. Izzo could break Knight’s Big Ten wins record at the house of John Wooden – Pauley Pavilion. 8.Tennessee(17-3) I’m not penalizing the Volunteers much at all for losing by two to Auburn, but I do get concerned with their lack of perimeter offense at times and just how hard scoring can be outside ofChaz LanierandZakai Zeigler. In Saturday’s loss, that duo shot 8-for-26 and really didn’t get much help, yet they were in position to win. I still really like this team, but don’t see them making the Final Four because of the offensive questions. 9.Marquette(17-3) Over the last 49 Big East games that he has coached, Shaka Smart is 39-10. WhileKam Joneshas been the headliner for the Golden Eagles,Stevie Mitchelldeserves more national love for picking up the opposing team’s best guard defensively and also evolving his offensive skill set. The 6-foot-3 guard had 21 points, four rebounds, three assists and three steals in Friday's87-74win overVillanovato tie the Golden Eagles with St. John’s at 8-1 in the Big East. 10.Purdue(16-5) I thought long and hard about it, but here’s why the Boilermakers are in my top 10. I think the loss toOhio State— as much as it was a tremendous win for the Buckeyes and nothing should be taken away from them — was a reflection of the Boilermakers’ fatigue coming off the trip toWashingtonandOregon. That was confirmed in a sense by a91-64drubbing of a top-25Michiganteam on Friday in whichBraden Smithhad 24 points, 10 assists, seven rebounds, four steals and just one turnover.

        "source": "https://www.foxsports.com/",
        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY Two years ago, thePhiladelphia EaglesandKansas City Chiefsput on quite a show in Super Bowl LVII in Glendale, Ariz. They combined for 750 yards of offense and eight touchdowns, and it wasn't decided until a field goal with eight seconds left in the game. It was exciting and dramatic. It featured big plays and big performances by some of the NFL's best players. It was so good, in fact, that they have decided to do it again. The rematch will take place inSuper Bowl LIXon Feb. 9 at the Superdome in New Orleans (6:30 p.m. ET on FOX) when the NFC Champion Eagles take on the AFC Champion — and two-time defending Super Bowl winners — Chiefs. The coaches and quarterbacks are still the same as they were two years ago, and they still feature many of the same players. But there is no doubt that a lot about both teams has changed, and this could be a very different game. The last time they engaged in an offensive shootout. This time they could end up locked in a much more defensive game. That's because neither team is built for the same kind of offensive explosion they were capable of two years ago. The Eagles might actually be closer to the juggernaut they were back then, but they're not the same kind of offense. They are almost all about the run, powered by their newest star, running backSaquon Barkley. His near-record season with 2,005 rushing yards has powered them all year long and turned them into arguably the most dangerous rushing team in the league. As a result, they lean much more on Barkley than they do on quarterbackJalen Hurts, who was an MVP candidate two years ago. Hurtsshowed on Sunday that he's still capable of big games, throwing for 248 yards and a touchdown and running for three touchdowns in a 55-23 win over theWashington Commandersin the NFC Championship Game. But offensively, at least, the Eagles are now Barkley's team. That doesn't make them any less dangerous necessarily. But it does make them less explosive at times. Meanwhile, Chiefs quarterbackPatrick Mahomeswas the MVP two years ago when the Chiefs beat the Eagles for the championship, but he wasn't even a Pro Bowler this season when he threw for 3,928 yards and just 26 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. Kansas City has been much more reliant on their top-10 defense — which, by the way, was particularly strong against the run all season long. That's been what's kept them in almost every game they've played, almost all of which have come right down to the wire. In fact, the Chiefs have played 12 one-score games this season, leading many to think they might finally be vulnerable. But they've still won them all, including their dramatic 32-29 win over theBuffalo Billson Sunday night in the AFC Championship Game. Mahomes did have one of his best games of the season against the Bills, throwing for 245 yards and a touchdown and running for 43 yards and two touchdowns. But it was still the Chiefs' defense that was called on to preserve the win in the fourth quarter and kept Buffalo's dangerous quarterbackJosh Allenmostly in check, by limiting him to just 237 passing yards and 39 yards rushing. Even if that defense finds a way to shut down Barkley and the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX, though, the Chiefs still might need a little more, because Mahomes is going to have to find a way to break through against the No. 1 defense in the NFL. The Eagles don't boast the same historic pass rush they had two years ago when they had 70 sacks in the regular season. But they are a better defense with a better scheme and better tacklers. And they have become dangerous in creating turnovers, like the four they forced on Sunday against the usually sure-handed Commanders. It won't be as easy for the Eagles in two weeks, of course. The Chiefs are still basically the same core group that has been to seven straight AFC Championship Games and five Super Bowls in the last six seasons, winning three of them so far. And they are motivated by trying to become the first team in NFL history to win the Super Bowl three years in a row. The Eagles had a chance to stop that run before it started two years ago when they went toe-to-toe with the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII, thanks to a brilliant performance by Hurts. The Eagles quarterback threw for 304 yards and a touchdown and ran for 70 yards and three touchdowns. It took a 27-yard field goal byHarrison Butkerin the final seconds for the Chiefs to avoid overtime and escape with a 38-35 win. But the defenses took a backseat in that game. Both offenses were virtually unstoppable. These Chiefs and Eagles just aren't built that way this season, so another shootout seems hard to envision. This time the Super Bowl championship might come down to the best defense, and which of the two battle-tested coaches and quarterbacks can find a way to break through.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY TheNFLconference title matchups only gave the masses odds for two separate games. However, bettors certainly found enough on the menu, particularly high-rolling bettors. Six-figure wagers littered the landscape for Sunday’s games, along with one seven-figure play that paid big. More on that wager, along with other notable parlays, unique wins and other big bets — winners and losers alike — as we recap NFL playoff betting. One Million Dollars On Jan. 20, a Caesars Sports customer dropped by Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip. The bettor was well-equipped to go all in on theKansas City Chiefsfor the AFC Championship Game vs. theBuffalo Bills. Rather than worry about the Chiefs -1.5 on the point spread, the customer just took Chiefs moneyline -130, meaningPatrick Mahomes& Co. just needed to win the game, regardless of margin. The wager amount: $1.3 million. In another classic Bills vs. Chiefs showdown, Kansas City got there with a 32-29 victory. So the bettor got there, as well, profiting $1 million, for a $2.3 million total payout. Caesars Sports vice president of trading Craig Mucklow took the big payout in stride. \"Before the game, we were Bills fans, both for the Super Bowl futures and for the match itself,\" Mucklow said, while looking at the bright side of the Chiefs victory. \"The only highlight for us is that we can come up with more fun Taylor Swift-themed props for the Super Bowl this year.\" Parlay Par-tay A couple of four-leg futures parlays got to the finish line Sunday at Caesars Sports. The first was a $500 play that mixed NFL,college football,MLBandgolf: Add it all up, and you’ve got odds +48200, or 482/1. The bettor profited a hefty $241,000. Similarly, a Caesars customer put $750 on: That hit racked up a $239,240.63 win for the bettor, thanks to odds of +31899 (about 319/1). Both bets originated last summer and were certainly worth the wait. Underwhelming Results Anyone who bet the Under in theWashington Commandersvs.Philadelphia Eaglesshowdown certainly didn’t have to sweat it out until the end. This game had Over written all over it by halftime, when Philly led 27-15, in an NFC title game with a total of 47.5. Six minutes into the third quarter, the Over hit on aJalen Hurtsnine-yard touchdown run, giving the Eagles a 34-15 lead. Philadelphia went on to blow out Washington 55-23. That result stung particularly hard for a DraftKings Sportsbook customer who dropped $1 million on Under 47.5 about two hours before the game. Caesars Sports took a trio of six-figure Under bets on Commanders-Eagles: The Bills-Chiefs game also saw the Over hit, though not quite as easily. The total closed at 49.5, which got there a few minutes into the fourth quarter of K.C.’s 32-29 victory. Borgata Sports, a BetMGM property in Atlantic City, had a customer put $215,000 on Under 49.5. So that was yet another big donation to the house. On the flip side, there were some Over bets that proved well played: Here’s Hoping You Had It It’s not all about cashing out wild parlays or fortuitous futures bets for thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. When you multiply any wager even by 10 or 15 — or in this case, 24 — and that wager comes through, it’ll nicely fatten your wallet. Caesars Sports had Chiefs quarterbackPatrick Mahomes+2400 to score two or more touchdowns. Mahomes got his first on a one-yard run late in the second quarter, and he added a 10-yard TD run with 10:14 remaining in the game. If you just threw 10 bucks on Mahomes, then you turned a nice profit of $240. Eagles third-string running backWill Shipleywas a +2100 long shot to score a touchdown Sunday vs. the Commanders. But with Philly blowing out Washington, everyone got playing time. So Shipley hit paydirt on a two-yard TD run late in the fourth quarter, the final score in Philly’s 55-23 rout. A $10 bet on Shipley yielded $210 in profit at Caesars. I Like Big Bets And I Cannot Lie As already well demonstrated above, big money was flying around on NFL conference championship odds. The following are several more notable big plays: This list could go on and on, to be sure. We’ll wrap up with a wager that was lighter than those, yet turned a very nice profit. And in relatively short order. A Caesars Sports customer put $5,000 onKareem Hunt+1000 to score the first touchdown in Sunday’s Bills-Chiefs game. Six minutes into the first quarter, the Chiefs running back scored on a 12-yard run, giving K.C. a 7-0 lead. So the bettor turned $5,000 into $50,000 profit (total payout $55,000). You can’t beat that kind of ROI, particularly just a few minutes into the game. Patrick Everson is a sports betting analyst for FOX Sports and senior reporter for VegasInsider.com.

The Eagles star running back rushed for 118 yards on 15 carries (7.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns in the victory. It didn't take long for Barkley to establish himself in Sunday's game, either. After the Commanders took an early 3-0 lead, Barkley found the end zone on the Eagles' first play from scrimmage. He ran toward the sideline on a carry, spinning out of tackles before having broad daylight ahead to reach the end zone for a 60-yard touchdown to give his team a 7-3 lead. [Check out our hub for all things Tom Brady here!] Brady asked Barkley about the importance of that touchdown, but he struggled to come up with the right words to say as he was in awe of clinching his first ticket to the Super Bowl. \"We wanted to set the tone, send a message to everyone watching and to the game, \"Barkley said. \"Man, I'm going to the Super Bowl. I don't really know what to say. I'm so excited. I'm happy for this team. It was a team effort. Our goal is not just getting there, it's winning it. So, one more.\" Barkley added his second score of the game on the Eagles' ensuing drive, rushing for a four-yard score after a fumble gave them a short field. His third touchdown was another four-yarder, running into the end zone to give Philadelphia a 48-23 lead in the fourth quarter. In between those two touchdowns, Barkley was seen on the sideline massaging his calf to try and stay fresh. He remained in the game and impacted in more ways than one. On the Eagles' second drive of the second half, Barkley was the lead blocker forJalen Hurtson the quarterback's nine-yard touchdown run that gave the Eagles a 34-15 lead. Brady was a fan of that play on the broadcast and lit up when he discussed it with Barkley afterward. \"Whatever it takes. That's the mindset,\" Barkley said of his block. \"You can only be great with the greatness of others. That's the mindset. That's what we've been doing all year. Just got to sell out. It's a championship game. Made a big block there and Jalen made a great read and got into the end zone.\" Barkley's performance in the NFC title game was just another outstanding chapter of what's been a great year for him in Philadelphia. He rushed for over 2,000 yards in the regular season and was within striking distance of the record for the most in a single season before the team opted not to play him in the regular season finale. His performance caused him to earn some MVP buzz, being named a finalist for the award earlier in the week. But for Barkley, reaching the Super Bowl is his top achievement this season. He knows the Eagles have another game to win, though. \"I expected this. This is why I came here,\" Barkley said. \"This is why I wanted to be in Philly. This is why me and my family made the decision to come here. We felt like we could grow my family name, my legacy and come out here and compete for championships.

        "source": "https://www.foxsports.com/",
        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY Liam Coen understood the assignment on Monday when he was introduced as the Jaguars' new head coach — mostly. The former offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who was recently hired to replace Doug Pederson, knew exactly how to address the Jacksonville faithful at the team's press conference. His execution could use work, though. Coen's awkward rendition of the Jaguars' signature \"Duval\" chant garnered most of the attention at his introductory press conference.Considering the dramathat surrounded Coen's hiring in the first place, he's had a memorable start to his NFL head-coaching career. To recap: owner Shad Khan parted ways with general manager Trent Baalke to clear a path to land Coen, who reversed course after telling Tampa Bay he planned to remain the team's offensive coordinator. Khan called Coen late Wednesday, persuading him to change his mind about interviewing and consider becoming the eighth head coach in franchise history and fourth in the past six years. But first impressions aren't everything, in both the real world and the NFL.Just ask Dan Campell, who was ridiculed for saying, \"we're going to bite a kneecap off\" when he was introduced as the head coach in Detroit four years ago. Now the Lions are the two-time defending NFC North champs. It's too early to know what kind of coach Coen will be, but what he had to say about how he plans to turn the Jaguars sounded promising, even if his \"Duval\" needs a little practice. Here are the other takeaways from Coen's first media session as Jacksonville's new coach. Khan was looking for an offensive-minded coach who would modernize the Jaguars and get the most out of Trevor Lawrence, who signed a five-year, $275 million contract extension in June. \"The fundamental thing that we need to address and the No. 1 thing, obviously, is the quarterback position and our commitment to Trevor,\" Khan said. \"I think it's well known, and we believe in him. \"That was the fundamental question really to all the candidates: How would they do it? After we got done with that, it was very evident to me that Liam was the guy.\" The 39-year-old Coen was the architect of one of Tampa Bay's most productive offenses in its history in 2024. The Buccaneers ranked third in the NFL in yards (399.6 per game) and fourth in points (29.5). Coen became the first NFL coordinator in at least the past 25 years to average more than 28 points a game, average more than 6 yards a play, convert more than 50% of the time on third down and score touchdowns 65% of the time in the red zone. And Coen envisions having similar success in Jacksonville with Lawrence, who has missed eight games the past two seasons because of various injuries. \"When I went and watched his response to negative plays, whether it was a pick, an incompletion, a critical third down miss or a punt or whatever it was, I felt like he always responded,\" Coen said. \"And that was something that I was like, 'Man, OK, he's got that. That takes (heart). That's all that matters. That's not all that matters, but in that moment, that's what matters. And so I saw that and I'm like, ‘OK, he's got that.' That's huge to start off with.\" The Jaguars lost 18 of their final 23 games under former coach Doug Pederson, who was fired with a 23-30 record after three seasons. One of the main complaints about Pederson's team was it lacked an identity — on either side of the ball. \"How do we want to play the game? Fast, fundamentally sound, attacking, situational masters and tough both mentally and physically,\" Coen said. \"It is players over plays. How do we make this as much about the players and making this about bringing out the best in you.\" Getting there, Coen said, starts with creating culture. It's a topic he's already broached with Lawrence and fellow captain and defensive endJosh Hines-Allen. \"I heard guys that are yearning for more, just more culture, more unity, more communication, just everybody being on the same page, a true aligned vision and for everybody to be able to tell each other some hard truths in ways and see each other's blind spots and communicate those because that's where the growth occurs,\" he said. Coen interviewed Minnesota defensive backs coach and passing game coordinator Daronte Jones on Monday for Jacksonville's defensive coordinator position. He also already decided to retain special teams coach Heath Farwell, who signed a three-year contract Monday. Two of Farwell's specialists, punterLogan Cookeand long snapperRoss Matiscik, made the Pro Bowl. \"That was a no-brainer,\" Coen said. The Associated Press contributed to this article.

Philadelphia entered Sunday atop the oddsboard at +180, but after its dominant showing in a win over Washington earlier in the day, its odds shortened even further, to +100. The Eagles forced four turnovers in a decisive 55-23 win over their NFC East rivals, booking their second trip to the Super Bowl in the last three years, as previously mentioned. Then, it was the Chiefs' turn, and they did what they always do, coming up clutch in a close win over AFC rival Buffalo, winning 32-29. With that, K.C. took over as slight Super Bowl favorites.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY TheBillsremain at a frustrating level of football limbo: consistently a great team in the regular season, but just as consistently unable to get past theChiefsin the playoffs. Sunday's 32-29 defeat in the AFC Championship Game marked the fourth time in five years that Buffalo has lost to Kansas City in the playoffs, with three of those four losses coming at Arrowhead Stadium. Buffalo is 61-22 since the start of 2020 — the Chiefs are the only team with more wins in that span — but the Bills haven't been able to get even a Super Bowl appearance out of that run. Over those five years, they're 0-4 in the playoffs against the Chiefs and 7-0 against everyone else. So the story will be the same: How can Buffalo andJosh Allenget past Kansas City andPatrick Mahomes? The Bills have been able to beat the Chiefs in the regular season, but they can't do it when it matters most. They've been painfully close — a tie game in the fourth quarter Sunday, a lead in the fourth quarter in each of the previous two seasons, losing 27-24 last year and 42-36 in overtime in the playoffs after the 2022 season. Buffalo has won five straight division titles, owning the AFC East since Tom Brady left thePatriots, but that success has fallen short of the Super Bowl. The Bills have won 48 regular-season games in the past four years, and when they went to four straight Super Bowls from 1990-93, they won 49 over that four-year span. So, next season will again be a mere preface to the inevitable collision with the Chiefs in January. Can Buffalo win enough games to secure the AFC's top seed, so that showdown takes place in Buffalo and not in Kansas City? Until he beats the Chiefs and gets to a Super Bowl, Allen's legacy with Buffalo will be one spent entirely in Mahomes' shadow. As they try again in 2025, the Bills will also have a surplus of draft picks, which should allow them to either draft a deep class of rookies or package picks to move up as they want. They have an extra second-round pick from trading receiverStefon Diggsto theTexans, extra picks in the fourth- and sixth-round picks from other trades, and two compensatory draft picks, both likely after the fifth round, for losing two free agents last year in receiverGabe Davisand edge rusherLeonard Floyd. They'll need to lean on the draft for impact because they're unlikely to have a ton of cap space for substantial signings in free agency. They're over the projected 2025 salary cap right now, but can restructure contracts and cut or trade players to create additional cap space. As for their own free agents, there are only two that should be expensive to keep: receiverAmari Cooper, who was acquired from theBrownsat midseason, and cornerbackRasul Douglas. SafetyDamar Hamlinis also a free agent, as is receiverMack Hollins, who had a touchdown in Sunday's game. Running backJames Cook, who led the NFL with 16 rushing touchdowns this past season, is entering the final year of his rookie contract and is now eligible for a lucrative extension. The Bills will again have to face a first-place schedule — both Super Bowl teams, the Chiefs andEagles, will play in Buffalo in the regular season. But the schedule also gives the Bills an easy division in the NFC South, a potential four-game sweep, though they'll face a tough division likely with multiple playoff teams in the AFC North. Buffalo has won at least 11 games five years in a row, a rare sustained level of regular-season success, but until the Bills can find the same kind of winning in January, the franchise will continue to fall short of that elusive first Super Bowl championship. Not so long ago, this franchise had gone 25 years without a single playoff win before it got one in 2020. But at this point, that won't ease the pain of the team's loyal fans, especially watching the Chiefs go to the Super Bowl year after year. Greg Auman is an NFL Reporter for FOX Sports.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid and theKansas City Chiefsare back in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs took down theBuffalo Bills,32-29,in the AFC Championship Gameon Sunday. Kansas City has made it to the conference title in all seven seasons with Mahomes as the starter and is now 5-2 in such games. Additionally, this is the third straight year that the Chiefs have won the AFC title game. It's only the fourth time in NFL history that a team has made it to the Super Bowl in three consecutive seasons. However, unlike the previous three teams, the Chiefs will have a chance to do something that has never been done: win three Super Bowls in a row. As the Chiefs prepare to take on thePhiladelphia EaglesinSuper Bowl LIX(Feb. 9, 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX), let's put the Chiefs' historic run in perspective. Here's a by-the-numbers look at their dominance under Mahomes and Reid. 4:Mahomes remained undefeated in the playoffs against arguably his top quarterback rival, improving to 4-0 in the postseason againstJosh Allen. He also broke the tie in their all-time series, moving to 5-4 against Allen as the Bills have won the last four regular-season games between the two teams. 7-2:Allen has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL over the past five years and could potentially win the MVP for the 2024 season, but defeating Mahomes and the Chiefs has been his biggest hurdle. He's 7-2 all-time against all other teams in the playoffs, further showing how muchMahomes' run has been a blockage to other great QBs. 17-3:Mahomes' new postseason record, breaking a tie for the second-most playoff wins for a QB in NFL history. Mahomes, who surpassed four-time Super Bowl champ Joe Montana, trails onlyTom Brady(35) for the most postseason victories in a QB's career. 3:Just two quarterbacks have been responsible for Mahomes' three playoff losses. Brady did it twice. He defeated Mahomes and the Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game during the 2018 season with the Patriots and in Super Bowl LV with the Buccaneers two years later. Joe Burrow was under center for the other, leading theCincinnati Bengalsto a win over the Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game during the 2021 season. 2:Mahomes rushed for two touchdowns in the Chiefs' win over the Bills, with the second being a pivotal score in the fourth quarter. That was a first for Mahomes, who had never rushed for two touchdowns in a playoff game before. 50:Mahomes also threw a touchdown against the Bills, giving him 50 total touchdowns in his playoff career. He passed Aaron Rodgers for the second-most total touchdowns in postseason history with his three scores. Now, he ranks behind only Brady for the most all-time. The seven-time Super Bowl winner had 95 total playoff touchdowns in his career. 9:As the Chiefs seek a three-peat, Sunday's win marked the ninth straight playoff victory for Mahomes and the Chiefs. That's the second-longest streak in the Super Bowl era. They could tie the Patriots' record of 10 if they win Super Bowl LIX. Patrick Mahomes won his fifth AFC title on Sunday. (Photo by Todd Rosenberg/Getty Images) 12:Mahomes has played all but two of his non-Super Bowl playoff games at home in his career. He improved to 12-2 all-time in postseason games at Arrowhead Stadium. Of course, only Brady has more with 21 career home playoff wins. 105:This season's AFC title game marked the 105th time that Mahomes has led the Chiefs to victory since he became their starter in 2018, the most for a quarterback in a seven-season span in NFL history. He's 105-26 as a starter in those seven seasons, while Brady is the only other QB with at least 100 wins over a seven-year span (2001-07). 5:Mahomes joined Brady (10) and John Elway (five) as the only starting quarterbacks in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl five times. Mahomes, 29, will be the only quarterback to start five Super Bowls before turning 30. 28:Reid is also knocking on the door of history. He now has 28 playoff victories, moving him three away from tying Bill Belichick (31) for the most ever for a head coach. 19:Additionally, Reid has 19 career playoff wins at home as a head coach, which is the second-most in NFL history. That also trails Belichick, who won 21 postseason games at home in his career. 6:Reid will be going up against the team that gave him his first opportunity to be a head coach in Super Bowl LIX. He led the Eagles to the Super Bowl once and has guided the Chiefs back there for a fifth time, giving Reid six total Super Bowl appearances. That brought him into a tie with Don Shula for the second-most ever for a head coach, behind Belichick's nine. Andy Reid is heading to the Super Bowl for the sixth time as a head coach in his career. (Photo by Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) 7:Bills coach Sean McDermott was a longtime assistant under Reid in Philadelphia, with Sunday improving the Chiefs head coach's record to 7-0 all-time against his former assistant in the playoffs. The others who've lost to Reid are John Harbaugh, Doug Pederson and Brad Childress. 17:If it seems like the Chiefs have a stranglehold in close games, it's because they do. They've now won 17th straight one-score games (including playoffs), which is the longest such streak in NFL history.

        "source": "https://www.foxsports.com/",
        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY Jerry Jones and theDallas Cowboyssurprised theNFLworld when they decided to promote offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to become their next head coach. As the Cowboys opted to keep the hire in-house, Jones disagreed with the prevailing narrative that he wasn't willing to leave his comfort zone in Dallas' search. \"I know that Shotty is no stranger to these guys,\" Jones said in a 10-plus-minute response to the first question at Monday's introductory press conference. \"I know he's no stranger to this building. I get my proverbial ass kicked over needing people in my comfort zone. Without this thing being about me in any way, if you don't think I can't operate out of my comfort zone, you're so wrong. It's unbelievable. \"This is as big a risk as you can take. As big a risk as you can take. No head coaching experience.\" To an extent, the Cowboys' decision to hire Schottenheimer was outside the box. As Jones mentioned, Schottenheimer has never been a head coach before, and it isn't typical for teams to promote an assistant to head coach after a losing season, so there's certainly a risk involved from that standpoint. However, Schottenheimer was only one of four candidates to interview for the role, as most other teams searching for a head coach this offseason interviewed at least twice as many.Coloradohead coach Deion Sanders didn't interview for the role, but he was contacted by Jones, as three of the five candidates most linked to the job had a Cowboys connection. Additionally, Schottenheimer had received head coach interest in the past, withhis first interviewcoming with theMiami Dolphinsin 2007. He hasn't been viewed as a top head coach candidate much in recent years, with the Cowboys being the only team to interview for head coach this offseason. Schottenheimer also didn't call plays for the Cowboys' offense after he was promoted to be the team's offensive coordinator in 2023, with former head coach Mike McCarthy holding those duties. Jones, though, insisted that he could tell Schottenheimer had head coach qualities when he worked with him over the last few seasons, mentioning his background as he's the son of former NFL head coach Marty Schottenheimer. \"I have a good background in the makeup of what a coach is,\" Jones said. \"To think that you can make a decision in an interview and if you didn't and had never communicated or had a visit, I wouldn't dare have an interview unless I talked to many, many people that knew that person, and had those kinds of life experiences. … Knew their story. \"We know what osmosis is, and we know what Shotty grew up around. … Frankly, from the standpoint of Shotty, those X hairs crossed. Shotty might never had been in our mirror, our view, had he not joined us to be with Mike as a consultant three years ago. … I've sat in [a] handful of meetings with Shotty. I've listened, I've watched him. I've watched him have deference to his head coach. I've watched him have deference to experienced guys like [defensive coordinator Mike] Zimmer. … I've watched him bite his lip sometimes when he didn't necessarily agree with that direction. But he bit his lip, as his daddy would have told him to bite your lip.\" As Jones is taking a chance on Schottenheimer, the new Cowboys head coach claimed he had previous opportunities to become head coach, but he wasn't prepared for them. \"I've had some opportunities when I was a much younger man that I didn't feel like I was ready,\" the 51-year-old Schottenheimer said. \"I'm ready now. I know what I want. I know what it looks like.\" Schottenheimer has 25 years of NFL coaching experience, noting that his first head coaching opportunity came during his first stint as a play-caller, from 2006-11 with theNew York Jets. He said he had \"a pause,\" and a three-year run as Pete Carroll's offensive coordinator with theSeattle Seahawksalmost a decade later played a big role in him believing he could be a head coach, in part from the challenges Carroll presented him. After helping quarterbackDak Prescottrecord a career year and finish second in MVP voting in 2023, Schottenheimer is confident that his past and relationship with the quarterback will help him out as he'll retain play-calling duties. \"Iron sharpens iron,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Dak and I have an incredible relationship, just like I have an incredible relationship with all these guys. Dak and I know how to push each other's buttons, we know how to have hard conversations. I laugh because I think about training camp last year, a ball got intercepted and we kind of had a thing in place where it was like if you throw an interception, you come out. And so I took Dak out and he's like, 'What?' \"He pushed back. The competitor in him is special.\" Obviously, getting the best of Prescott will be one of Schottenheimer's biggest duties. Prescott will begin his record-setting four-year, $240 million extension in 2025 after coming off a down season that ended early due to hamstring surgery. To put even more pressure on the Cowboys, two of their division rivals made the NFC Championship Game this season and their streak of 29 seasons without playing in the NFC title game is now the longest in the NFL. Schottenheimer is expecting that to change. \"We're going to win. And we're going to win a championship,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Otherwise, why are we doing it?\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

        "source": "https://www.foxsports.com/",
        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY Hall of Fame receiver Michael Irvin spoke for manyDallas Cowboysfans when addressing the team's in-house promotion of offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to head coach of \"America's Team.\" Irvin had lobbied for a former Cowboys teammate to take over for Mike McCarthy, who parted ways with the team after an impasse in contract negotiations. \"We missed an opportunity,\" Irvin said on his podcast. \"I was pushing for Deion Sanders to be the head coach. And I still stand 10 toes down on that push.\" Irvin went on to say that the Cowboys had fallen behind their NFC East rivals, as evidenced by thePhiladelphia EaglesandWashington Commandersplaying for the NFC Championship on Sunday. The Cowboys are the only NFC team that has not played in the conference title game in the past 30 years. The fan base has grown accustomed to a once-proud franchise not competing for Super Bowls. The Cowboys certainly deserve criticism for not casting a wider net in their head-coaching search, interviewing just four candidates before settling on Schottenheimer when other teams interviewed twice as many coaches. Add in the fact that the Cowboys are the most valuable sports franchise in the world, and it's fair to wonder why 82-year-old owner Jerry Jones didn't take a bigger swing once McCarthy was out of the picture. That said, signing Schottenheimer to a four-year deal at a reasonable salary is a low-risk move for a family-run team that values continuity. Schottenheimer already has a good relationship with star quarterbackDak Prescott, who's coming off a season-ending hamstring injury. \"One of the things about me taking over this prestigious position is we can hit the ground running pretty fast because I don't need to learn the decision-makers,\" Schottenheimer said at his introductory press conference on Monday. \"I don't need to learn the quarterback. I don't need to learn how things work. And so, I feel like we're kind of ahead of the curve with some of these other teams that made changes.\" Although McCarthy called the plays for the past two seasons, the 51-year-old Schottenheimer has plenty of experience calling plays in previous stops with theSeattle Seahawks,New York Jetsand St. LouisRams. Schottenheimer served as the offensive coordinator for QB Mark Sanchez when the Jets reached back-to-back AFC Championship Games in the 2009-2010 seasons. And whenRussell Wilsonwas the quarterback from 2018 to 2020 in Seattle, Schottenheimer's offenses averaged 26.1 points per game. He should get similar if not better production with the Cowboys if Prescott returns healthy next season. Prescott and a handful of other Cowboys attended Schottenheimer's press conference on Monday. That continuity should serve them well as they move on from McCarthy, who won 12 games in three of his four seasons as head coach. Schottenheimer handled the presser admirably, emphasizing his relationships and communication skills gleaned from serving as an assistant coach in college and pro football for 25 seasons. Those who have played for Schottenheimer say he commands a room, holds players accountable and offers a detailed approach to his craft, so he should not be overwhelmed by the multitude of tasks head coaches must handle. Schottenheimer also had a good coaching mentor in his father, Marty Schottenheimer, who had a 200-126-1 record in 21 seasons as an NFL head coach. No, Schottenheimer is not a sexy choice, and Jones is understandably taking heat both nationally and in Dallas for the hire when more experienced choices were available. \"I get my proverbial ass kicked over needing people in my comfort zone,\" Jones said Monday. \"Without this thing being about me in any way, if you don't think I can't operate out of my comfort zone, you're so wrong it's unbelievable. \"This is as big a risk as you can take, as big a risk as you can take. No head-coaching experience.\" Jones and Cowboys fans can take comfort in knowing that there have been other underwhelming hires recently that have worked out just fine. The Cowboys can look within their own division, where Eagles coach Nick Sirianni was criticized after a cringy introductory press conference. Sirianni now has the Eagles in their second Super Bowl in three seasons. Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell talked about biting kneecaps during his introductory presser but has built the team into one of the best in the NFC. Schottenheimer is a coaching lifer and the son of one of the most successful coaches in NFL history. The Cowboys should be competitive with him in charge. Of course, winning regular-season games hasn't been the issue in Dallas; winning in the postseason has. As Jones hires the ninth head coach in team history, the question remains: Will this move lead the Cowboys back to the Super Bowl after a 30-year absence? [Related:Ranking the Cowboys' 9 head coaches in franchise history: Mike McCarthy top 5?] That's the plan, according to Schottenheimer. \"The main thing is we want to win the Super Bowl,\" he said. \"My dad always talked about that. He said, ‘Well, why would you have any other goal?' It should be about winning the Super Bowl. Only one team [wins], but that doesn't mean you don't strive for that.\" Eric D.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY In a season that’s seen the public betting masses do quite well and a divisional round in which the sportsbooks regained some ground,NFLconference championship odds had something for everyone. Sunday’s two games featured a ton of scoring, which is always good for the betting public. But with both underdogs getting a lot of attention, having both favorites win and cover helped some bookmakers. \"We did well, considering the high scoring. I think we will find some bettors who also had a good day. I think both we and the bettors as a collective will sign for it,\" BetMGM senior trader Tristan Davis said. Oddsmakers at sportsbooks across the country recap the weekend that was in NFL conference championship betting. Hail To The Chiefs In the AFC Championship Game, theKansas City Chiefsclosed as either 1- or 1.5-point home favorites vs. theBuffalo Bills, depending on the sportsbook. Ostensibly, the bookmakers were saying all week that this was a coin-toss game, and it certainly played out that way. The Chiefs got a field goal with 3:33 left to break a 29-29 tie, then forced the Bills to turn it over on downs, securing a 32-29 victory. That was a mostly favorable result for The SuperBook. \"We did pretty well. We had good conference futures positions on both the Chiefs and the Eagles,\" SuperBook vice president John Murray said. But the 61 combined points weren’t ideal behind the counter, on a total that closed at 49.5. \"There were a lot of parlays playing the Over in both games,\" Murray said, alluding to a scoring bonanza in theWashington Commandersvs.Philadelphia Eaglesgame, as well. The Tourist Special Although the Bills and Commanders were generally trendy road underdogs, there were pockets where that wasn’t the case. That included BetMGM Nevada’s books up and down the Las Vegas Strip. Saquon Barkleyand the Eagles ran wild on the Commanders, posting a 55-23 blowout as 6-point home favorites. The total on that game closed at 47, and anyone who bet the Over cashed their ticket relatively early in the third quarter. \"We got smashed on both the game and on conference futures,\" BetMGM Nevada’s Scott Shelton said. Then, as noted above, the Chiefs won and covered in another high-scoring contest. \"The tourist special actually cashed, with favorite and Over to favorite and Over,\" Shelton said. But all in all, much like BetMGM nationally, the sportsbook’s Vegas operation had a give-and-take day. \"We ended up a small loser for the day. We took some big late money on Bills +1,\" Shelton said, noting the Chiefs’ 3-point win was helpful in that respect. \"The day could’ve been much worse.\" For Prime Sportsbook, which operates in Ohio and New Jersey, the day was much worse, particularly with the Eagles’ blowout victory. \"One of the most bittersweet moments in bookmaking is getting blowtorched on a big game by the team you’ve been a fan of you’re entire life,\" Prime’s Joe Brennan Jr. said. \"Philly absolutely crushed us. \"After paying out to everyone and their brother on the Birds, they all came back for seconds on the Chiefs. The only good thing about this Super Bowl matchup is that one of those teams has to lose.\" Overwhelming Outcomes As noted above, the Over easily hit in both conference title games. Interestingly, two of the day’s largest wagers — one on each game — were actually on the Under. Ahead of the Commanders-Eagles kickoff, DraftKings Sportsbook took a massive $1 million bet on Under 47.5. That bettor never had a chance. The first half featured 42 points — Philly led 27-15 — and the Eagles put it over the top on aJalen Hurts9-yard touchdown run that made it 34-15 six minutes into the third quarter. At Borgata Sportsbook, a BetMGM property in Atlantic City, there was a $215,000 wager on Bills-Chiefs Under 49.5. It took a little longer to get there, almost five minutes into the fourth quarter. ButPatrick Mahomes’ 10-yard TD run and the Chiefs’ subsequent 2-point conversion gave K.C. a 29-22 lead, which clinched the Over. So those two major wagers were hefty donations to the house. Super Bowl Shuffle In Super Bowl odds, the Chiefs are consensus 1.5-point favorites vs. the Eagles. No surprise, some scoring is expected, as well, with a consensus total of 49.5, which will almost surely get bet higher. Kansas City is seeking an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl title. Chiefs-Eagles is a rematch from two years ago, when K.C. was a 1-point underdog and outlasted Philly 38-35 in Super Bowl LVII. Super Bowl LIX takes place on Feb. 9, with a6:30 p.m. ET kickoff on FOXfrom the Superdome in New Orleans.

It is the third time Chelsea has paid a world-record fee for a player, afterDenmarkforwardPernille Harder($355,000) in 2020 andColombiaforwardMayra Ramirez($542,000) last year. The 24-year-old Girma was under contract with the Wave until 2026. She was drawing interest from French club Lyon and Arsenal, Chelsea's rival in the Women's Super League. Girma was presented on the field in front of Chelsea's fans ahead of Sunday's game against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge in the WSL. \"I'm so happy and really excited to be here. It doesn't feel real,\" Girma said. \"There are a lot of things about Chelsea that made me want to come here — the culture, the winning mentality, staff and players. It's a top environment to learn and grow in. Right now, that's what I'm looking to do. It was an easy choice for me.\" Girma made her debut for the national team in 2022. She has appeared in 44 games with the United States and played on the squad that won the gold medal at the Paris Olympics. Girma was namedU.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year for 2023. She also won the federation's Young Player of the Year award in 2020. During the Olympics, U.S. coach Emma Hayes, the former coach at Chelsea, called Girma\"the best defender I've ever seen.\" \"Naomi is a world-class defender who is now coming into the prime years of her career,\" said Paul Green, Chelsea's head of women's football. \"Her composure on the ball, ability to read the game coupled with her pace and athleticism will add top quality to an already very talented squad.\" Girma was captain of the Stanford team that won the national championship in 2019. She was taken at No. 1 in the 2022 National Women's Soccer League draft by the Wave. She was named the league's Rookie of the Year and Defender of the Year in her first season.

        "source": "https://www.foxsports.com/",
        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY Editor's Note:Throughout the NFL playoffs, Chris Myers and his research team analyze upcoming matchups, while providing news, notes, and nuggets for inside access to the information an NFL broadcaster uses to prepare for calling a game. Both home teams won on Sunday, with the Kansas City Chiefs now heading to New Orleans forSuper Bowl LIXto take on the Philadelphia Eagles, the same team they defeated in Super Bowl LVII to start their streak of consecutive titles. This is just the second time in Super Bowl history that two teams will meet twice in a span of three big games. In 1992 and 1993, the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills met in back-to-back Super Bowls. Two years ago, quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts provided plenty of highlights in Kansas City’s 38-35 win. This will be the third time two quarterbacks have met for a second time in the Super Bowl. Troy Aikman’s Cowboys beat Jim Kelly's Bills in both Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII. Eli Manning also matched up twice with Tom Brady, but those two New York Giants wins came in a span of five Super Bowls. CHRIS MYERS ANALYSIS: \"The Super Bowl matchup is between a couple of powerhouse teams we are familiar with. Yes, there are NFL fans who have had enough of the Chiefs' success and those who haven't warmed up to the accomplishments of the Eagles, but the success of Kansas City and Philadelphia, both in recent years and this season can’t be denied. \"There is no shortage of star power, with Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid and the Swiftie effect with Travis Kelce for the Chiefs and the animated Nick Sirianni and the likable Saquan Barkley for Philadelphia. I think as neutral fans digest this matchup, they will appreciate what should be a highly competitive game and come to a decision about who to root for. \"It is notable that Tom Brady will be calling his first Super Bowl in a game that pits the last team he beat (Kansas City, Super Bowl LV) against the last team to beat him there (Philadelphia, Super Bowl LII).\" HERE'S HOW BOTH TEAMS GOT HERE Philadelphia Eagles 55, Washington Commanders 23 Only one team was able to win on the road in these playoffs, the Commanders who did it twice — in Tampa and Detroit. But they could not make it three in a row as the Eagles became the first team since 1982 to win three home playoff games in one postseason. The Eagles are now plus-10 in turnover differential in this postseason, with six fumbles recovered, four interceptions and not a single giveaway of either kind. The Eagles tied an 85-year-old NFL record with their seven rushing touchdowns Sunday. The 1940 Chicago Bears scored seven rushing TDs in the NFL Championship Game — and that also happened against Washington. In winning 73-0, those Bears scored 11 total touchdowns with three on interception returns and one on a forward pass. The Eagles have rushed for 10 TDs this postseason, tied for second-most in NFL postseason history. The record of 12 was set by Denver in 1997 when they ended up losing to Green Bay in Super Bowl XXXII. Saquon Barkley went 60 yards for a touchdown on Philadelphia’s first play. It was his seventh TD of 60-plus yards in this extended season, setting an NFL record. His three TDs of 60+ yards are also a record for any one postseason. Barkley now has 2,447 rushing yards in the extended season (regular season and postseason) and needs 53 in the Super Bowl to become the first NFL player with 2,500. He needs 30 to eclipse Terrell Davis’ 1998 record of 2,476 which was finalized by 102 yards against the Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII. Like Barkley, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts rushed for three TDs against Washington. He now has nine rushing TDs, a new career record for a quarterback. Former 49ers QB Steve Young had the prior mark with eight. Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert had one carry in his 103-game career (with playoffs), good for one yard, prior to Sunday. But Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore gave it to him twice on the ground for gains of nine and four yards against the Commanders. On the Washington side, punter Tress Way had not thrown a pass since 2018, but he hit a perfect strike for 23 yards to Ben Sinnott on a fake punt Sunday. Way ended the three-game postseason with only two total punts on his real job. Kudos to tight end Zach Ertz on his 11-catch performance to set a Washington postseason record.  It was his highest total in a game since 2019 when he played for Philadelphia. ONE THING WE LIKED FROM THE BROADCAST: FOX came up with a great shot from the end zone on Nate Shipley’s late 59-yard run, showing his varied expressions as he struggled to stay ahead of the pursuing Commanders. And Tom Brady, capping a strong performance, adroitly provided a timely and charming narration for the pictures. CHRIS MYERS ANALYSIS: \"For Washington to win this game they would have had to play a near error-free game and force a turnover or two. Instead, it was Philadelphia which forced the fumbles that fueled a big lead. \"Can the Eagles play from behind? After the 18-play field goal drive that made it 3-0 Washington, a drive that could have been a blueprint for a Commanders' victory, the Eagles grabbed the lead and hit the game pedal, closing out the game in impressive fashion. \"In addition to the three fumbles, the Commanders committed some ‘panic penalties’ and for the first time in these playoffs showed their inexperience. \"I can’t tell you how many times in our production meetings, coaches cite giveaways and takeaways as the key to victory – and with a plus-10 margin so far and zero giveaways, the Eagles are proving that formula. Vic Fangio as defensive coordinator was perhaps the key coaching hire of 2024, and he is maximizing the great talents of Jalen Carter. \"The Eagles have a 10-3 ratio of rushing TDs to passing TDs this postseason, and if they can do something like that against the Chiefs, say three rush and one pass, I like their chances.\" Kansas City Chiefs 32, Buffalo Bills 29 The Chiefs are now the first team to go to five Super Bowls in a span of six seasons. They have become the first team to get within one win of a three-peat, although the Bills circa 1990 are still the only team with four straight Super Bowl appearances (L-L-L-L). The Miami Dolphins in the early 70s (L-W-W) and the Patriots starting in 2017 (W-L-W) also had runs of three straight SB appearances. The Chiefs have a 17-2 record this season despite not once scoring more than 30 points in a game. Josh Allen had now produced 28.3 PPG in four postseason meetings with the Chiefs — and he is 0-4. For Patrick Mahomes, he now has 17 postseason wins, moving past Joe Montana into second place on the all-time list. He is still not halfway to Tom Brady’s 35 postseason wins. Mahomes has multiple wins in his last six postseasons. ONE THING WE LIKED FROM THE BROADCAST: We liked how Jim Nantz, a master of the timely nugget, slipped in the inside information after a Patrick Mahomes-Xavier Worthy TD pass that each was drafted with a first-round pick obtained in a trade with the Bills. CHRIS MYERS’ ANALYSIS: \"While there were a few officiating issues that seemed to favor Kansas City, ultimately the Chiefs were the better team in crunch time. After the Bills tied it with six minutes left, they drove to a field goal, stopped the Bills on downs and then ran out the clock. \"Down three, you thought that Josh Allen would at least get them to field goal range, but the fourth-and-5 play was disrupted by Steve Spagnuolo’s blitz and the Chiefs then trusted Mahomes for a pair of successful passes for first downs. \"James Cook was a revelation for the Bills in this game with 138 scrimmage yards, but he did not touch the ball on Buffalo’s final 11 offensive plays. \"So, it is back to the drawing board for the Bills. In the past six seasons they have won 78 games (includingthepostseason) — that’s 13 wins per season. But they are stuck in a conference with the Chiefs (the only team with more wins at 94) and have not been able to get past them to make the Super Bowl. Much like the Marv Levy Bills who went to four Super Bowls in a row, the current version of the Bills has had some great achievements that hopefully won’t get lost in their inability to win a Super Bowl so far. \"Meanwhile, this Chiefs team stands 17-2 and on the cusp of an unprecedented achievement – despite not scoring more than 30 points in any game and having a point differential of plus-71 that is only the 11th best in the NFL this season. The 17-3 Eagles are +210 this year, but Kansas City opens up the betting as a slight favorite. It might not be a glamorous match-up (except for one Chiefs player’s girlfriend) but it should be tightly played and fascinating.\" Chris Myers is an Emmy Award-winning play-by-play announcer, reporter and studio host for FOX Sports.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY TheMiami Heathave suspendedJimmy Butlerindefinitely, the team announced Monday. Butler was to return for the Heat against the Orlando Magic on Monday night, after completing his second suspension of the month, but walked out of shootaround after being informed he wasn't going to start,according to ESPN. Butler was suspended for Miami's most recent two gamesafter missing a team flight to Milwaukee last week.He has missed14 of Miami's last 19 games entering Monday, including nine of the last 12 because of the suspensions —the first a seven-game banforconduct that the team deemed detrimental,followed by the two-game suspension. Butler hasn't come off the bench in a game since Jan. 27, 2017 — exactly eight years ago Monday in a game, ironically, against Miami, when he and then-Chicago teammate Dwyane Wade criticized how the Bulls were playing. Including playoffs, Butler has started in each of his last 560 appearances. \"It kind of feels normal now at this point,\" Heat guardTyler Herrosaid Monday morning at shootaround when asked what it's like to have Butler available again after a suspension. \"Kind of is what it is, but nothing's guaranteed. We've just got to be ready to roll with whatever cards we're dealt tonight. We've just got to be ready to go.\" Butler wants a trade, and Miami is trying to comply.But moving Butler and his $48.8 million salary this season is likely going to be more complicated that it would have been in past seasons, largely because of the league's aprons — salary levels installed as part of the new collective bargaining agreement that restrict the ways bigger-spending teams can make certain moves. It has been a sagathat has lasted nowfor nearly two monthsand figures to come to a head — one way or another — over the next week and a half. The NBA's trade deadline is Feb. 6, which means Butler might have played his last game in Miami. The Heat next play at home on Wednesday against Cleveland. After that, they leave for a four-game road trip to San Antonio, Chicago, Philadelphia and Brooklyn — that Nets game getting played on Feb. 7, one day after the deadline. Butler has said repeatedly throughout this process that he still loves Miami, in the off-the-court sense. \"I love this city with everything that I have,\" he said this weekend while appearing at a padel tournament that he co-chaired. The issue, for him, is with the team. Butler became eligible last summer for a two-year, $113 million extension that the Heat have not offered him.Heat president Pat Riley said after last seasonthat the team had reservations about such a deal since Butler has missed about one of every four Miami games since he joined the team. Butler entered the seasonsaying he was not upset about the extension not getting done. It appears that stance changed in recent weeks, and the team announced earlier this month that Butler asked for a trade — something he cannot do publicly by league rule. Butler is averaging 17 points per game this season. He had one of the best statistical games in Heat history against Detroit on Dec. 16 — 35 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists. In six appearances entering Monday since then, including one where he departed in the first quarter with an illness, Butler is averaging 9.5 points, 2.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY The Super Bowl is back in New Orleans, with an epic showdown between theChiefsandEaglesset for Feb. 9 at the Superdome, and who better to talk to about the big game in the Big Easy than Drew Brees. The formerSaintsquarterback is a surefire 2026 inductee to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and won a Super Bowl himself with New Orleans in 2009. He took a few minutes to talk with FOX Sports about why the Super Bowl is special to New Orleans, this year's matchup and other NFL topics. FOX SPORTS:First and foremost, what does it mean to have the Super Bowl back in New Orleans? BREES: It's tremendous. It's the 11th time New Orleans is hosting the Super Bowl, tied for the most with Miami. And there's a reason they keep going back to New Orleans, because it's a great host city. They know how to throw a party. They know how to show everybody a good time, just good old Southern hospitality. New Orleans really enjoys entertaining and it's so well situated for it. When you think about that downtown New Orleans area with the French Quarter, the CBD (Central Business District), the warehouse district, you've got the dome right there, all the hospitality, all the hotels, restaurants, live music. I mean, everything is just walking distance. So you literally just drop down in the city, and you never have to jump in a car. You're just walking everywhere. And there's just a vibrancy and energy that you just feel as you walk around. Everyone is so friendly and so inviting. We love to show off our city. We love to show off our culture, and I think it's something people really appreciate, and that's why they keep coming back to us. [Prepare for the epic Eagles-Chiefs matchup onFOX Sports' Super Bowl LIX hub] FOX SPORTS:How many Super Bowls have you been to as a fan? Were you there for the last one in New Orleans in 2013? BREES: I was not in the stadium. I was a little upset after that season (in which the Saints went 7-9), so I decided not to go. Most Super Bowls, I'm there for events during the week, and I get home to sit on the couch with my family and watch the game. And some of that is out of frustration because you're not playing in the game, but I've been to quite a few of the games. I did go to a few Super Bowls while I was playing, just because there were teams that I felt like I could get some sort of strategic advantage by watching them in person. But this one I will be at, as the Chiefs try to make history and the Eagles try to prevent them from making history — and get some revenge from two years ago. FOX SPORTS:You won the only Super Bowl you played in, so you were efficient that way. You've gotPatrick Mahomesgoing for his fourth title and an unprecedented third in a row. You've gotJalen Hurtsfacing the same team for the second time in three years, still trying to get his first title. Who has more pressure on him? BREES: You could say the Chiefs have been carrying this quote-unquote pressure for the whole season. I think I speak for everybody who really knows the game and is just in awe of what the Chiefs have been able to accomplish. Despite the fact that, like, truly, at times this year, they didn't look great. They definitely looked like they had some deficiencies and they weren't as efficient as you would have expected them to be, and yet, they finished the season 16-1. It's every week you're saying, \"What's wrong with the Chiefs? What's wrong with the Chiefs? What's wrong with the Chiefs?\" And they're 16-1, right? Well, I don't care what's wrong. They're figuring out ways to win. They got championship DNA, like, if there's a moment at the end of that game where they have a chance to make a play, chances are they're going to make that play. It's really hard to bet against the Chiefs. I would say this, though, the Eagles look unstoppable on offense right now. I don't see how you tackleSaquon Barkley. They're so good up front. And then you got Jalen Hurts, who's a threat to run the ball at all times, so he almost becomes like an extra blocker in the run game. So, inevitably, you've got Saquon one-on-one with somebody in the open field, and good luck to you. And then defensively, they're really, really stout too. And they have the motivation of having lost going toe-to-toe with the Chiefs two years ago and just barely losing that game, 38-35. So, there's an edge there. And I'm sure a little bit of like, \"Hey, we've got nothing to lose. The Chiefs have the pressure on them, not us.\" FOX SPORTS:Stepping away from the game for a second, there are so many young quarterbacks, first- and second-year guys in the league. Is there one that you've taken a liking to or one that you've really been impressed the most by in the past year or two? BREES: This year, the season thatJayden Danielshad was really phenomenal. There's a poise and a composure that's beyond his years when you think about just being a rookie quarterback. That run that they went on was in large part due to his play-making ability and leadership and the way that all those guys believed in him. AndBo Nix, down the stretch with Denver. I mean, golly, they were hot, and he was playing extremely well with Sean Payton. Those were the first-year guys that jumped out to me. But then I think about all the quarterbacks in the league that are in their sixth year or less. You know,Joe BurrowandC.J. Stroud, andBryce Youngovercoming the early adversity this year and finishing the year the way that he did. I mean, the future is so bright with these young quarterbacks. They're so much fun to watch. They're so dynamic. I think the league's in good hands right now with these young QBs. FOX SPORTS:With all eyes on New Orleans now, the Saints are the only team yet to hire a coach. What do you think of that job and that situation, and what does the team need to do to get back to where they were when you were there? BREES: Unfortunately for them this year, they were just decimated by injury. I think we all saw what the Saints could be when they were healthy. First two weeks, they were world-beaters, right? Then all of a sudden, you lose a receiver, you lose another receiver, you lose interior linemen, you loseTaysom Hill, you loseAlvin Kamara. You lose the quarterback. That's tough sledding. I think they still have great core pieces in place to make a run at it. Look, I think the division is wide-open as well. It's not like the NFC South has been setting the world on fire, right? I think nine wins has won that division here the last last couple years. It's a quarterback-driven league, so I think you need to make sure that you have an offensive system in place and a coach who jells withDerek Carr, and is able to put him in a position where he can be at his very best. That dictates a lot of what happens with the rest of the team and the vibe. Defensively, I think we've always had great leadership, and I feel like we've been a top-10 defense for the last probably eight years in a row. Unfortunately, those guys were put in some really tough spots last year with all the injuries. So I think the core pieces are in place. You just find a coach who can really put a culture and a foundation and accountability in place, and obviously systems that fit the strengths of the players. I think you've got a great group of leaders, continue to add to that through free agency and then the draft. FOX SPORTS:For people going to New Orleans for the big game, you're working with On Location, which has premium packages for fans looking to get into the game and enjoy some events around the game as well. BREES: This is a lot of fun. On Location is putting together a ton of really unique experiences in New Orleans. They are the official hospitality provider for the NFL for Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans. So they've got a big \"Taste of New Orleans\" event, where they're bringing a bunch of chefs together, a bunch of flavors together, a fun event at the Superdome prior to the game and giving fans a unique peek behind the curtain to Super Bowl 59 in the Superdome before the fireworks begin. I'm going to be at a bunch of different events for On Location throughout the week, interacting with fans, just having a good time. So for anybody who wants to learn more about that and potentially be a part of some of these events, they can go to OnLocationExp.com. FOX SPORTS:Last thing I want to ask you about is Eagles linebackerZack Baun, who was a rookie with the Saints your last year in the league. What do you remember about him and what is it like to see how he has emerged for the Eagles this season? BREES: I've been really excited for Zack, and I think he's an incredible story, and honestly one that should garner a ton of inspiration for a lot of young players. You know, here was a guy who came in, third-round pick with the Saints, mainly a special teams player fromWisconsin. We had a great core group of guys in place at the linebacker position, but for him, it was like, \"Hey, I'm going to do whatever I can to help this team. I'm going to learn from these guys. I'm going to take advantage of every opportunity I get.\" And then he gets the opportunity to go up to Philadelphia, and next thing you know, he's All-Pro and has been a huge part of their success on defense. Those are the guys you root for. I mean, I'm so happy for him. He's earned every bit of it. He deserves it. I think it's just another lesson for young guys that it's all about getting in the right situation and soaking up every ounce of information and wisdom you can from the guys that you have a chance to play with, and then just being ready for your opportunity. When your opportunity comes, man, make the most of it. Greg Auman is an NFL Reporter for FOX Sports. He previously spent a decade covering theBuccaneersfor theTampa BayTimes and The Athletic.

        "title": "Hurts So Good: Jalen Hurts silences critics in leading Eagles back to Super Bowl",
        "source": "https://www.foxsports.com/",
        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY PHILADELPHIA — He had been the subject of too many stories and too many hours of talk radio all season long, but it all seemed to be more intense in the last few weeks. There was so much worry about his abilities, so much criticism and so much angst. There was too much doubt about whetherJalen Hurtswas still the Jalen Hurts of old. Nick Sirianni had heard all of it, just like he always has. And for thePhiladelphia Eaglescoach, it has grown more tiresome than ever. So when he got the chance, with 3:53 left in an NFC Championship Game that was long since over, he called timeout to pull Hurts from the game and give his quarterback a curtain call. He wanted to give him the moment he deserved — and maybe even needed — to finally hear the complaints drowned out by the cheers. \"It's amazing how much doubt there is sometimes,\" Sirianni said. \"I can't quite comprehend it. Because it doesn't look like people think it should look like? But the guy has been clutch. He has won a ton of football games. \"We don't care how it looks. He just continues to win. I think the criticism is … whatever. He just wins.\" Hurts won again big on Sunday. He won over the often-skeptical Philadelphia fan base and he won his second trip to the Super Bowl in three years, leading the Eagles to a 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders. He completed 20 of 28 passes for 246 yards and a touchdown, and he ran for three touchdowns too, as the Eagles booked their trip to New Orleans for Super Bowl LIX. There is no one inside the Eagles organization who doubted Hurts was capable of a performance like that. But on the outside, there seemed to be nothing but doubt. In his two playoff games, Hurts looked rusty at best, limited at worst, and lost for those in a panic. He had missed the last two games of the season after suffering a concussion on Dec. 22. He returned for the playoffs not looking at all like himself. It was fine, though, because the Eagles won both games, even though Hurts had turned into a game manager, throwing for a total of 259 yards in two postseason games. They were perfectly capable of running over the competition onSaquon Barkley'sback. But at some point, it figured they were going to need more from him if they were going to continue their quest to avenge their loss in the Super Bowl two years ago. And on Sunday, they got it all. \"I love when people doubt him,\" said Eagles left tackleJordan Mailata. \"We always talk about limiting the outside noise or the white noise, whatever you want to call it. But I know he hears that. And I think he plays his best when he feels like people doubt him. \"That's when he does stuff like he did today.\" Hurts did everything in this championship game. He joked that offensive coordinator Kellen Moore \"let me out of my straight jacket a little bit\" and put more of the game plan in his hands. And Hurts delivered, answering every one of the lingering questions hovering over him. He showed everyone he still had the touch, rediscovering his accuracy on throws both short and deep. And after connecting on just three passes with his No. 1 receiver,A.J. Brown, in the first two playoff games despite throwing to him 10 times, he reignited that powerful connection too, hitting him six times (on eight throws) for 96 yards and a touchdown, too What was most impressive, though, was he looked like the old Hurts with the way he moved around inside and outside of the pocket. He did not look mobile at all in the first two playoff games, outside of a 44-yard touchdown run early in the divisional-round win over the Rams. He suffered an injured left knee late in that game, which forced him to wear a brace and left many wondering if he would be missing that key part of his game. But he wasn't missing anything. He only ran 10 times for 16 yards in this one, letting Barkley carry the ground game with 118 yards. But the quarterback dazzled with his ability to escape a sometimes fierce Washington pass rush. He kept a step ahead of the defenders, even if it was to just get out of trouble and throw the ball away. He created plays outside the pocket too. He kept the defense off balance. That's what Hurts was so good at two years ago when he led the Eagles to their last Super Bowl and was very nearly the NFL MVP. And the Eagles knew it was all still there, just ready to pop out in a big game. \"I think he's just made for those moments,\" Mailata said. \"His whole demeanor. Everyone always gives him stink about wishing he would crack a smile here and there. But because of his cool, calm, collectiveness, he's able to just be in the moment, make plays, make sure that we're all on the same page. \"That's why he plays the way he does in the big moments when we need him.\" And when they don't need him? That's OK, too. That's always been OK with Hurts and the rest of the Eagles, who don't care that his performance doesn't always look spectacular. While the world around him bit their nails, there was no panic in the locker room about his performance in the first two games of the playoffs. To his coaches and teammates, he didn't have anything to prove. And they couldn't believe that anyone, anywhere thought that he did. \"He deals with so much criticism which just blows my mind,\" Sirianni said. \"The questions I have to answer, I'm like ‘This guy wins. He's won his entire life.' Winning at quarterback is more important than any stat. He wins. He's a winner. He doesn't care about anything other than winning. \"And I know that. That's selfless.\" And that's Jalen Hurts. \"I don't play the game for stats,\" Hurts said. \"I don't play the game for numbers or any statistical approval from anybody else. I know everyone has a preconceived notion for how it's supposed to look.\" And he doesn't care. He defines success by only one way. The Eagles won their first two playoff games, so they were successful. They won again on Sunday, but it didn't make it any more special to him because of the way he played. He is now headed to the Super Bowl for the second time in his five-year career. And his goal two weeks from now will be the same as it always has been. He's not looking for style points. He's not looking to prove his value. And he doesn't care if he has to carry the Eagles or just sit back and manage the game. His definition of success is the same as it's been since as far back as he can remember. \"What I define it as is winning,\" Hurts said. \"The No. 1 goal is to come out and win.\" And if he keeps winning, even those doubters will surely, eventually come around.

Despite another gutsy effort fromJosh Allenand his bunch, who took the two-time defending Super Bowl championKansas City Chiefsdown to the wire in the playoffs yet again, they were forced to watch in the closing seconds asPatrick Mahomesand the rest of their biggest rivals ran off the final seconds in a32-29 victory in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday night. For the fourth time in the last five seasons, the Chiefs had ended their postseason run. \"To be the champs,\" Allen said after emerging from the locker room, \"you have to beat the champs.\" The Chiefs will head to New Orleans and try to become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive Super Bowls, while the Bills head back to Buffalo, where they will rue another missed chance at their first trip to the big game since January 1994. \"They played as a team,\" Bills coach Sean McDermott said. \"They gave everything they had.\" It just wasn't enough. Again. [Read more:Where do Josh Allen, Bills go from here after another devastating loss to Chiefs?] Allen did about everything he could, moving the Bills downfield in the second half, trying to answer every Kansas City score with one of his own. He finished with 237 yards passing and two touchdowns without an interception, and his touchdown throw toCurtis Samuelwith 3:59 left in the game knotted it 29-all and gave Buffalo a fighting chance. But the Bills' defense, which was missingTaylor RappandChristian Benfordon the back end due to injuries, was unable to make a play when it mattered, and Mahomes marched K.C. within range ofHarrison Butker's go-ahead field goal. Even then, the Bills had an opportunity to win. They took over with 3:33 left, and Allen soon picked up a first down with a 13-yard scramble. But his next two passes were batted down at the line of scrimmage, and a short throw toAmari Cooperon third down could have been so much more if not for a shoestring tackle that brought up fourth down. As the Chiefs often do under defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, they brought a heavy blitz, and Allen had to backpedal away from defenders. He threw up a wobbly prayer deep downfield, and it was nearly answered by tight endDalton Kincaid, who just missed hauling in the heave and keeping the Bills' comeback hopes alive. The Chiefs took over, ran out the clock and were ready to take their party to the Big Easy to face the Philadelphia Eagles. [Read more:Patrick Mahomes is tearing down great QB legacies before they can even start] \"We had a chance with the ball in our hands, in Josh's hands, to win it and we came up a little bit short right there,\" McDermott said. \"I thought we had a chance to catch the ball, but at the end of the day, I'm extremely proud of this football team.\" In the Bills' last eight games against Kansas City, they have won every game in the regular season, including in Week 11 this season. But in all four matchups in the postseason, it's been the Chiefs left standing at the end. The Bills squandered other chances Sunday, too. When they scored late in the first half, they chose to go for the 2-point conversion and failed, leaving Kansas City with a 21-16 lead. And when the Bills scored on their opening possession of the second half and tried to get that miss back with another 2-point try, the incompletion left them clinging to a 22-21 lead. Early in the fourth quarter, the Bills were driving with a chance to extend that advantage. But after picking up one fourth-and-1 with a sneak, they tried again at the Kansas City 41. Allen was bottled up by the Chiefs'Nick Boltonat the line of scrimmage, and the Chiefs took possession — and promptly drove 59 yards for a go-ahead touchdown. It was that kind of game. Every little bit of real estate — every play — mattered in the end. Reporting by The Associated Press.

        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY Patrick Mahomesstole yet another Super Bowl appearance fromJosh Allen. No, no, don't get me wrong. I don't mean that the refs stole a Super Bowl. I'm talking about Mahomes, the 24-karat-gold quarterback in the Golden Era of quarterback play. This is supposed to be the best that quarterbacks have ever played, a deeper pool than whenTom Bradyand Peyton Manning tore up the league — even if, to this point, Brady remains the greatest ever. (Though … Mahomes is intent on catching up.) Allen is a generational talent, with the arm of John Elway and the legs of Cam Newton — but none of the Super Bowl appearances. Why? Mahomes.Lamar Jacksonis unlike any other QB we've ever seen, with a set of gifts so unique that it feels unfair to compare him to any of the great QBs. But again, Jackson has no Super Bowl appearances. Why? Mahomes is better. For Lamar, it's an all-the-time problem. He's 1-5 against Mahomes. For Allen, it's a playoff problem, with a 4-1 record against Mahomes in the regular season and a 0-4 record against Mahomes in the postseason. Those records fail to reflect the superlatives with which we could rain on Jackson and Allen. But there's no doubt: Mahomes is better. And even worse for those two QBs, he's greater. He proved that again in the Chiefs' 32-29 win over theBillsat Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night in the AFC Championship Game. Mahomes has won nine straight playoff games, the second-longest streak in the Super Bowl era. He has won 17 consecutive one-possession games (including the playoffs), the longest winning streak of this kind in NFL history. There was a lot that went into this Super Bowl appearance for Mahomes and the Chiefs. Steve Spagnuolo, Kansas City's defensive coordinator, dialed up a brilliant blitz on the Bills' final fourth-down conversion attempt and Allen and his offensive line looked confounded. Even without any time to throw, Allen got the ball into the air and nearDalton Kincaid, who dropped the attempt. Mahomes did nothing there, right? The Chiefs then drained the remaining 1:54 with a huge run fromIsiah Pachecoand a terrific dump-off reception fromSamaje Perine, who ran 18 yards after the catch on a 17-yard reception. Not much to see from Mahomes. If this game happened in a vacuum, it would be easy to look at it and say Mahomes had little to do with closing it out. But you'd be ignoring the Chiefs' go-ahead drive where Mahomes got his team into field-goal territory. You'd also be ignoring his 245 passing yards, 43 rushing yards and three touchdowns. But most of all, you'd be ignoring the big picture. Mahomes is a heartbreaker. He's a closer. He's a stone-cold winner. In a sense, he's greedy. With an insatiable hunger. He has no reservations about making sure there are no Super Bowl appearances available in the AFC. They all need to be his. Even if you're a Chiefs fan, you can pity what follows in Mahomes' wake. Just look at what he did to Allen, holding back tears in a postgame press conference. Can you imagine how frustrating it must be? Rolling the boulder up the hill (and making progress in the regular season) but waiting for it to fall on you (in the postseason)? How can Allen find confidence that he'll ever beat Mahomes? He's never played better in his career. And yet he couldn't win this game where he was afforded a perfectly good opportunity to put the Chiefs QB away. How do you pick yourself back up from that? But this is what great QBs do. They kill the dreams of others. They don't dwell on the emotions of others. They just keep collecting wins. Mahomes is building a résumé to be the greatest of all time. Just like Brady kept Super Bowls away from Manning, Drew Brees and Philip Rivers, Mahomes is blocking his AFC peers. And that ruthlessness is how Mahomes is making his way up the list of greats. Mahomes is second in playoff wins (17) — but he's not far behind Brady (21). Mahomes has three Super Bowl wins and, if he wins his fourth, he would tie Joe Montana, second only to Brady (seven). If Mahomes wins in Super Bowl LIX, he'll do something no one else has done: the three-peat. It's hard to doubt Mahomes and the Chiefs will win — even after theEaglesput up 55 points in the NFC Championship. There's still work to do, however. Mahomes must continue to build his legacy by devouring that of Allen. And Jackson. AndJoe Burrow. AndC.J. Stroud. (Mahomes is just getting started there.) AndBrock Purdy. AndJalen Hurts. That's right: Hurts is Mahomes' next victim. It wasn't more than two years ago when Mahomes beat Hurts in Super Bowl LVII. Can Mahomes do it again? He's the NFL's omnivore, as unflappable, ruthless and consistent as Pac-Man. And with every victory and every new heartbreak for an opponent, the Chiefs QB only seems to get stronger.

        "source": "https://www.foxsports.com/",
        "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY United States defender Naomi Girma has becomewomen's soccer's first million-dollar player. The 24-year-old Girma completed her move from San Diego Wave to Chelsea for a reported 900,000 pounds ($1.1 million) on Sunday. Here's a look at how the record transfer fee (in USD) in the women's game has increased over the course of the century: The Brazilian midfielder moved from Fiammamonza in Italy to Rayo Vallecano in Spain for $310,000, a clear record at the time. Domingues wasn't the most distinguished player at the time of her transfer. She changed clubs to be closer to her then-husband, soccer legend Ronaldo, who left Inter Milan to join Real Madrid in 2002. Domingues actually never played for Rayo Vallecano. Clubs weren't allowed to play foreign players at the time due to Spanish FA rules. So, she went back to Fiammamonza. Domingues' transfer fee record was intact for 18 years before Denmark forward Pernille Harder left German side Wolfsburgto join Chelseain England for $355,000 (300,000 euros). In her four seasons with Wolfsburg, Harder won UEFA Women's Player of the Year twice, leading her club to the Champions League final in both seasons. Harder continued to play at a high level for Chelsea, helping the squad win the FA Women's Super League and FA Cup in all three seasons she was there. She was dealt a thigh injury that required surgery and sidelined her for five months in her final season at Chelsea, but she eventually returned to help dish out the assist for the game-winning goal in the FA Cup final. She scored 24 goals in 48 matches with Chelsea. Harder's record didn't last anywhere near as long as Domingues'. England midfielder Keira Walsh moved from Manchester City in England to Barcelona in Spain for $513,000 (400,000 pounds), with Chelsea also playing a role in the pursuit of the star. As Walsh helped England win the Euros a couple of months prior to her move, she had also helped Man City win the FA Women's League Cup and finish as the runner-up in the Women's FA Cup earlier that year. She won eight total league titles during her time at Manchester City. Walsh has had similar club success with Barcelona. She helped it win the Champions League in each of her first two years with the club, adding two Liga F titles. Chelsea set the transfer fee record again in 2024 when it picked up Colombian forward Mayra Ramirez from Spain's Levante in a deal worth $542,000 (500,000 euros). Ramirez, who was 24 at the time, had Colombia reach the quarterfinals in the World Cup the previous summer and had scored 22 goals in 38 matches with Levante. She's had some similar success so far playing with Chelsea, recording 11 goals in 30 matches with the English club. She was a part of its Super League-winning squad in 2023-24, which helped her win the EFE Trophy for Best Ibero-American Player that season. An NWSL club quickly took the record for the largest transfer fee in women's soccer history just a month after Chelsea recaptured it. Zambian striker Rachael Kundananji movedfrom Madrid CFF in Spain to Bay FCin the United States for $788,000. Kundananji was a dominant striker at Madrid CFF, scoring 33 goals in her 43 caps with the club. Internationally, she had helped Zambia pick up an upset win over eventual champion Spain in the 2023 World Cup with her goal in its group play match. So, as she was just 23 at the time, Bay FC decided to make a huge splash ahead of its inaugural season, making her the first African player (men's or women's) to set a transfer fee record. She wound up scoring two goals in 12 matches in her first season with Bay FC, who gave her a four-year deal. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Politics Reporter, HuffPost President Donald Trump said Monday he intended to put tariffs on a wide swath of products and basic materials in American life, a prospect that could lead to prices shooting higher for U.S. consumers. “In particular, in the very near future, we’re going to be placing tariffs on foreign production of computer chips, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, to return production of these essential goods to the United States of America,” Trump said during an appearance before House Republicans holding their annual party retreat in Doral, Florida. “We’re going to look at chips, semiconductors, and we’re going to look at steel and some other industries. You’re going to see things happening.” Trump also listed aluminum and copper as potential tariff targets as “things that we need for our military.” If he follows through, the tariffs could have a big impact on Americans’ costs of living. Trump has often incorrectly said tariffs — charges put on goods imported into the U.S. — are paid by the country the goods originate from. Companies that bring in the goods actually pay the tariffs. Economists are almost unanimous that tariffs are passed from those companies to shoppers in the form of higher prices on store shelves. Asurvey of a panel of economists by the University of Chicagofound 95% agreed that tariffs are passed on. Trumpduring the campaign threatened 10% tariffson almost all imports and higher ones on Chinese imports in particular. But he has taken a more measured approach since being sworn in on Jan. 20. The conservative American Action Forum ina studyprojected the broad tariffs would cost U.S. households between $1,700 and $2,350 a year, depending on whether other countries retaliated, as Colombia President Gustavo Petro threatened to do. He has threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods starting on Feb. 1, and took the same tack in a brief international spat with Petro Sunday night. Trump’s rhetoric Monday may have been more economic saber rattling. But if he followed through, the implications for household items like computers or cellphones could be huge. Production of computer chips, semiconductors and drugs has moved to Taiwan, Trump said, “And we want them back.” He criticized one of former President Joe Biden’s signature bills, a bipartisan one named the “CHIPS and Science Act” that provided incentives for companies to manufacture computer chips in the U.S. Instead, Trump said, companies would be willing to build plants in America because “they’re not going to want to pay a 25%, 50% or 100% tax.” “They’re going to build their factory with their own money. We don’t have to give them money,” he said. Trump’s appearance at the annual event was meant to unify and pump up the rank-and-file members for the tough political battles ahead as Republicans try to finally settle on the specifics of what they will pass on border security policy, boosting defense spending, taxes, and possibly hiking the limit on the U.S. government’s debt. But Trump did little to clear the air in a fundamental divide between the Senate GOP with some conservative and libertarian House Republicans and most House Republicans: whether to have multiple separate bills carrying different items or one catch-all bill with all of them. “Whether it’s one bill, two bills, I don’t care. Let these guys, they’re going to work it out,” he said. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

        "title": "Donald Trump Ignores Federal Laws As He Moves To Reshape Washington",
        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — Donald Trump unleashed a flurry of sweeping executive orders, proclamations and regulatory freezes during his first week in office aimed at reshaping the federal government and enacting his MAGA agenda. And one thing the president isn’t letting get in the way of his mission: federal laws passed by Congress. Over the weekend, Trumpfiredat least 17 inspectors general, whose job is to root out corruption in government agencies, without notifying Congress in advance as required by statute, a move critics denounced as a “chilling purge” that signals the president intends to replace them with his loyalists instead. Several of Trump’s directives ordered government agencies to “pause” or withhold funds appropriated by Congress — including key climate investments, money for infrastructure projects and nearly all U.S. assistance to foreign nations — challenging the constitutional role of Congress and its power of the purse. Moreover, Trump’s decision not to enforce a federal ban on the social media app TikTok and his administration eliminating a school safety board that was created in the wake of the Parkland shooting massacre added to the list of actions that appeared to flout acts of Congress. “I think that Trump has issued many executive orders that are clearly illegal,” Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar and the dean of UC Berkeley’s School of Law, told HuffPost. “Some of it is political, some of it is to test the bounds of the law. He really wants to push executive power further than it’s ever been before.” Republicans whocomplainedabout executive overreach under Joe Biden’s administration praised Trump’s early administrative moves, even though some now acknowledge the president is acting outside the bounds of federal law. Asked Sunday if Trump violated the statute by not giving notice before firing the inspectors general across nearly all government agencies, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said, “No, he didn’t,” before retracting. “No, well, technically, yeah. But he has the authority to do it,” Graham saidduring an interviewwith NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “So I’m not, you know, losing a whole lot of sleep that he wants to change the personnel out. I just want to make sure that he gets off to a good start. I think he has.” Inspectors general are tasked with providing independent audits, inspections and investigations of government agencies. After Trump fired five inspectors general at the end of his first presidential term, Congress passed a law that increased the removal protections for the post, including requiring a 30-day notification as to the specific reasons for their removal action. Mark Greenblatt, inspector general at the U.S. Department of the Interior, said he received a two-sentence email on Friday evening informing him that he was terminated from his position. “These removals should be setting off alarm bells for a number of different reasons, but the primary one, in my view, is the independence of these positions,” Greenblatttold CNNon Monday. “The whole construct of inspectors general, it’s based on us being independent, that we’re not beholden to a political party … and so that’s the question is, what will — what will President Trump do with these positions?” Trump’s executive orders pausing the disbursement of funds appropriated by Congress drew criticism from ethics watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers who warned that Trump is violating the Impoundment Control Act, which sets limits on how much a president can restrict money approved by Congress. In addition to pausing nearly all U.S. foreign aid, Trump’s orders stopped money flowing to some programs established by Biden’s climate and health care law and his bipartisan infrastructure law. “Congress may give the president discretion regarding how to implement the programsfor which it appropriates money. But in general, the executive branch does not havediscretion whether to implement such programs,” the government watchdog group CREW wrote in aletterto congressional leaders on Monday. “Put simply, it is illegal and contrary to our constitutional structure for the president to disobey appropriations acts duly enacted after Congress publicly considers and determines funding levels for the federal government.” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, also criticized Trump’s spending freezes. The senator noted that both Trump and Russ Vought, his nominee to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget, view the Impoundment Control Act as unconstitutional despite there being no court decision finding it so. “It doesn’t matter how presidents feel about the law — it matters what the law is,” Murray said. “If Trump goes ahead and holds up funding that has been signed into law, it won’t just be illegal — it will hurt families, halt projects to rebuild America’s roads and bridges, kill good-paying new jobs and so much more,” she added. Trump’s executive order telling the Department of Justice not to enforce a federal ban on TikTok gave the popular social media app and its millions of users a reprieve — but it’s one that Congress never intended. The law, which passed last April, allowed the president to delay the Jan. 19 ban on TikTok for 90 days if he certified that there had been significant progress made toward a sale of the app. That’s yet to happen, and Trump hasdenieda report that the White House is working on a deal with Oracle and a group of other outside investors to secure TikTok’s presence in the U.S. “Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it, and I’d make that decision probably over the next 30 days,” Trumpsaidof TikTok’s future over the weekend. But lawmakers in both partiessaidthey don’t mind giving TikTok added time if it means its ties to China’s government are severed. “My understanding of where we are now is it’s much the same thing where there’s a period of time to allow a deal to be consummated,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told HuffPost last week. “The objective is to force China to sell the damn thing. If that’s where we end up, I’m happy.” Trump’s administration also terminated an office last week whose purpose was to advise federal agencies on best practices to protect students. It was created under Trump’s first term after the Parkland school shooting massacre and codified into law by the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which extended background checks for firearm purchasers under the age of 21 and boosted mental health programs. The panel included “school safety experts, alongside the parents of children who died in school shootings, advocates for civil rights and disability rights, superintendents, and leaders of organizations that represent school and district administrators,”according toEducation Week. The Department of Homeland Security, under which the advisory panel was housed, told the outlet it would “no longer tolerate any advisory committee which push agendas that attempt to undermine its national security mission.” “The bipartisan law, as you know, took assault weapons out of the hands of younger people and was the first major advance in gun safety since the Brady Law,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)saidSunday, referring to the federal law that required background checks on gun purchases. “I was the author of the Brady Law as well … this entire board, which is working hard to stop more Parklands from happening, has been shut down.” Legal experts said that every president issues executive orders testing the limits of their authority, but whether they will stick is far from guaranteed. “The ultimate question is will Congress find that these exercises of authority require any oversight? My assumption so far is, likely no,” said Aram Gavoor, an associate dean for academic affairs at George Washington University Law School. “I think it’s a bit of a wait-and-see. The president does appear to be exercising his authorities to deliver on campaign promises. Of course, litigation is already forthcoming, but many of these big questions would only be conclusively answered before the Supreme Court.” The next four years will change America forever.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "National Reporter, HuffPost Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests surged the week after PresidentDonald Trumptook office, with arrests Sunday totaling nearly 1,000 in a coordinated operation with other federal law enforcement agencies. The highly publicized spike in ICE arrests marks the beginning of Trump’s efforts to create a deportation machine of unprecedented magnitude in the modern era, and a profound shift from his predecessor’s more lenient approach toward deportations from the interior. White House Border Czar Tom Homan oversaw operations personally in Chicago, accompanied by celebrity talk show psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, whointerviewed an arrested Thai migrant he identified as Sam Seda. Homan said that Seda was convicted of sex crimes involving children. HuffPost could not immediately confirm what charges the man had faced, and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for details about his case. A tired-looking McGraw slowly questioned the man about his history and place of birth, with long pauses between questions. The man said his mother was a citizen and that he was born in Thailand. When McGraw asked what he had been charged with, the man said he wanted to speak with his lawyer. “You’re Dr. Phil?” the man asked at one point. “I’ve seen ‘Dr. Phil’ on TV.” The coordinated series of arrests, carried out with assistance from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, targeted people accused of serious crimes, according to ICE, which throughout the week posted a series of profiles of arrestees and their convictions or charges to its X account. ICE noted Sunday that it targeted Chicago specifically. Other ICE operations also targeted Atlanta, Puerto Rico, Colorado and Austin, Texas,according to CNN. Homan has repeatedly criticized Democratic-led cities and states like those targeted for attempting to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The ratcheting up of arrests marks a major shift in ICE tactics since former President Joe Biden took office. Over the four years that Biden held the White House, deportation of unauthorized migrants from within the United States fell to their lowest levels in at least 15 years, at 151,748 over his four years in office, according to agency statistics. Interior removals under Trump’s first administration were 2.5 times higher, topping 390,000. One of the major reasons why such a wide gulf separates the two presidents’ interior deportation figures is that Biden generally followed prosecutorial discretion guidelines that prioritized deporting people who presented a national security risk, those with serious criminal records and those who had a history of prior immigration offenses. Prosecutorial discretion was responsible for reducing interior removals from a peak of 871,901 under Barack Obama’s first term to 370,585 in his second. Trump did away with prosecutorial discretion during his first term, however, leading interior removals to creep back up again until the COVID-19 pandemic slowed them down. Trump did away with prosecutorial discretion policies again last week shortly after taking office. Homan told ABC News in an interview televised on Sunday that he intended for immigration authorities to focus primarily on people with serious criminal records but to expand arrests to more people over time. “We’re going to do this on a priority basis, as President Trump has promised, but as that aperture opens, there’s going to be more arrests nationwide,” Homan told ABC News. “If you’re in the country illegally, you’re on the table, because it’s not OK to violate the laws of this country.” Residents of some targeted areas, however, suspected that the rising number of arrests included migrants who had lived there for years without running afoul of the law. A man named Jesus Gonzalez,interviewed by local station Fox 32 Chicago, said that he voted for Trump, but disagreed with some of the arrests he was seeing in his neighborhood. “They’re targeting the wrong people,” he said. “People are afraid to go out. People are afraid to go to work. That’s not right — that’s not what America’s about. America’s about living the dream.” At the same time, the Trump administration has pressed aggressively for Latin American countries to accept flights of deportees. On Sunday,Trump threatened Colombian PresidentGustavo Petro with emergency tariffs of 25% on all imports for refusing to allow flights to land in his country. Trump said those tariffs would rise to 50% by the end of the week if Petro continued to block deportee flights. The next four years will change America forever.

Petro unconditionally agreed within hours to Trump’s terms, presaging the president’s likely strategy when confronting opposition from other countries to his treatment of deportees.

        "content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost PresidentDonald Trump’s acting attorney general abruptly fired more than a dozen officials who worked on the two criminal cases against him, his administration’s latest act of retribution against those deemed political enemies. Acting Attorney General James McHenry told the officials, who worked on former special counsel Jack Smith’s team, the Department of Justice could no longer “trust” them to carry out Trump’s agenda.Fox News was the firstto report the firings. “Today, Acting Attorney General James McHenry terminated the employment of a number of DOJ officials who played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,” a spokesperson for the DOJ said Monday,per The Associated Press. “In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the President’s agenda. This action is consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.” The names of those fired were not immediately available, butThe New York Times reportedthat many appear to be career lawyers at the DOJ. The outlet added that the firings seemingly violate civil service protections for nonpolitical employees. The firings are just the latest effort by Trump to quickly remake the federal government in his image and rid agencies of those deemed counter to that effort, even if such actsappear to violate federal law. The White House has removed at least 17 inspectors general at many government agencies andput all federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, staffon leave. Trump’s teamalso removedthe Justice Department’s senior career ethics officials from his post and reassigned him to a much less powerful role. The official, Bradley Weinsheimer, was appointed during Trump’s first term by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and was a respected member of the agency for three decades.

Smith’s team included around 40 lawyers as he worked to investigate Trump on twin cases: his alleged hoarding of classified documents after the end of his first term in office and his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. Both cases led to federal indictments, but neither moved forward andwere abandonedafter Trump’s ascension in November. Smith resignedshortly before Trump took office after submitting his final report on his investigations. Smith’s report said he believed the department had enough evidence toobtain and sustain a convictionon the Jan. 6 charges if they had gone to trial.

        "title": "Trump Took One Of His Executive Orders Even Further Than In 2020",
        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk Amemofrom the Trump administration’s top human resources official Monday laid out expansive descriptions of workers who could be stripped of civil service protections this year. The memo concerns a broad new category of federal workers that could be removed from the so-called “competitive service” and exempted fromprotectionsagainst “adverse actions” like being fired or suspended. These employees would be eligible to be transferred into “Schedule Policy/Career,” which waspreviously known as “Schedule F.” According to an executive order President Donald Trumpissued in 2020— and reissued,with some changes, after taking office last week — this new “schedule” of workers will include people in “policy-influencing positions,” defined as “positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.” And according to aninterim guidance memosent Monday by Charles Ezell, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, the Trump administration thinks this description could fit a whole lot of government workers. In a bulleted list, Ezell wrote that agencies should consider “rescheduling” positions involved in, among other things, “directing the work of an organizational unit,” “being held accountable for the success of one or more specific programs or projects,” “substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,” including “evaluation of grant applications,” and “publicly advocating for the policies of the agency or the administration, including before the news media or on social media.” Only a few thousand government employees — political appointees — typically leave their jobs when a new administration comes in. They are far outnumbered by those in the competitive service, who are hired based on merit and have strong employment protections. The broad descriptions in Ezell’s memo could make tens of thousands of career, nonpolitical employees — such as project managers, analysts and clerical workers — eligible to lose those protections, leaving their futures in the hands of their politically appointed superiors. “The categories of potential employees are extraordinarily broad,” Donald Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan who has closely tracked Trump’s attacks on the civil service, told HuffPost in an email. “Effectively, any employee that uses discretion involved in the interpretation and implementation of policy could be fired if they displease the administration. Officials who played PR or advocacy roles at the request of the prior administration can be fired now.” Trump’s new executive order goes further than the one he issued in 2020 by stating that jobs eligible to be rescheduled include any involving “duties that the Director otherwise indicates may be appropriate for inclusion in Schedule Policy/Career.” This line, which Ezell mentioned in his memo, expands the Trump administration’s authority to reclassify workers. The executive order and memo both contain language asserting that civil service protections won’t be stripped based on individual workers’ political beliefs. But the memo says federal employees are required “to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,” and the new executive order requires they carry out their work consistent with “the vesting of executive authority solely in the President.” If Trump’s first term is any indication, agency heads — political appointees installed by Trump — are likely to interpret affected positions broadly. Trump’s original “Schedule F” order was issued in October 2020 and therefore never fully put into effect. But before Trump left office, a few agencies did put together lists of positions they thought were eligible to be stripped of civil service protections. Among them, according topublicrecordsobtained by the National Treasury Employees Union, were IT specialists, human resource specialists and office managers, in addition to policy analysts, economists and legal roles. Notably, in addition to revoking Trump’s 2020 “Schedule F” order, Joe Biden’s administration also went through a formal rule-making process,completed in 2024, to codify existing civil service protections and put up barriers to future presidents attempting to copy Trump’s order. Now back in office, Trump appears intent on simply bulldozing through that 2024 Biden rule. Not only has an OPM press release for itbeen erased, but Ezell’s memo also states that Trump used his executive order to simply “directly nullify these regulations” where they stemmed from presidential authority. “OPM’s October 25, 2024, guidance document entitled ‘Implementing Guidance for Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles Regulations’ is hereby rescinded in its entirety,” Ezell’s memo says flatly. “The memo simply dismisses the Biden rule limiting Schedule F,” Moynihan wrote. “Biden went through a formal rulemaking process, but the Trump administration is saying that they can ignore that. This is the biggest change to the civil service system since its creation, and the Trump administration says they do not require any new legislation or following the rulemaking process.” The National Treasury Employees Union hasalready suedover Trump’s Schedule Policy/Career order, arguing the president exceeded his authority by potentially creating such a broad category of federal workers, and that statutory language about “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” was intended to refer only to noncareer political appointees, who change with every president, and not career civil servants. The new executive order gives OPM until Feb. 19 to come up with additional positions to potentially be rescheduled. “OPM will issue final guidance prior to that date,” a footnote in Ezell’s memo reads. Under the executive order, agency heads have 90 days to make a preliminary list of positions to reschedule and an additional 120 days to finalize the list.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost You’d think thatBill Gateshas several regrets, but he says there’s onethat trumps them all. In a profile with the UK’sThe Timespublished Saturday, the Microsoft co-founder calledhis split from his wife of 27 years, Melinda French Gates, his biggest blunder. “That was the mistake I most regret,” he told the British outlet, later adding: “You would have to put that at the top of the list. There are others but none that matter. The divorce thing was miserable for me and Melinda for at least two years.” Bill and Melinda Gatesannounced their separation in 2021, and share three adult children, Jennifer Gates Nassar, 28; Rory Gates, 25; and Phoebe Gates, 22. “There is a certain wonderfulness to spending your entire adult life with one person because of the memories and depth of things you have done and having kids together,” Gates told the outlet. “When Melinda and I met, I was fairly successful but not ridiculously successful — that came during the time that we were together. So, she saw me through a lot.” French Gates’ support of her ex-husband included doing the bulk of the child-rearing, Gates admits. “I spent more time with the kids than my dad did, but the ratio was still 10:1, with Melinda doing most things for the kids. We had a great time,” the billionaire said. A family wasn’t the only thing the former couple built together. They also founded theBill & Melinda Gates Foundation— one of the largest charitable foundations in the world. French Gatesresigned as co-chair last year, and their charity was renamed Gates Foundation. The philanthropist told the Times that his ex’s resignation “disappointed” him. “When we got divorced it was tough and then she made the decision to leave the foundation — I was disappointed that she took the option to go off,” Gates said. French Gateshas opened up about how awkward it wasfor her to continue her work at the foundation while going through a divorce with Gates. “I kept working with the person I was moving away from, and I needed to show up and be my best self every single day,” shetold Fortune magazinein 2022. “So even though I might be crying at 9 a.m. and then have to be on a video conference at 10 a.m. with the person I’m leaving, I have to show up and be my best.” French Gates hasalso expressed some of her reasons for wanting to end her marriageto Gates, telling “CBS This Morning” in 2022 that “not one thing, but many things” ultimately led to the split. “It wasn’t one moment or one specific thing that happened,” French Gates told host Gayle King. “There just came a point in time where there was enough there where I realized it just wasn’t healthy, and I couldn’t trust what we had.” French Gates also admitted to CBS that one of things that contributed to the unraveling of their marriagewas Gates’ connection to late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. “I did not like that he’d had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no,” she said. “I made that clear to him. ... [Epstein] was abhorrent. He was evil personified. I had nightmares about it afterward.” When reached for comment by CBS, Gatesreleased a statementin which he called his ties to Epstein “a mistake that I regret deeply” and “a substantial error in judgement.” Although French Gates has taken steps to move on from her marriage, Gates told the Times that they still interact.

        "content": "Reporter, HuffPost Famed economist Paul Krugman on Monday warned howDonald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants is set “to hobble food production and home construction” and will likely — contrary to Trump’s campaign promises — send grocery prices soaring. Krugman, the winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, explained in the latest issue ofhis Substack newsletterhow the president’s vows to hike tariffs and conduct mass deportations of undocumented immigrants will “likely to do a great deal of economic damage.” But it’s the targeting of immigrants that “will spiral out of control,” he predicted. The current fear among immigrants ― amid the Trump White House’s immigration enforcement blitz ― will have “major consequences, with workers staying home or, if they can, going back to their home countries, with businesses laying off valuable employees for fear that they may be raided,” Krugman argued. Nearly 1,000 people were arrested on Sunday alone,reported CNN. Trump’s second administration hasnixed safe spots for migrants— such as schools and churches. The economist envisioned an increase in vigilantism against immigrants. And “losing a large fraction of these workers would be a serious blow to the economy, especially because immigrants, legal and not, play a much bigger role in some industries and occupations than they do in the economy as a whole,” he said.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Health officials in Kansas say they are battling an “unprecedented” tuberculosis outbreak that’s infected at least 146 people in the state’s northeast. As of Friday, there are 67 people currently being treated for active cases of the bacterial disease, commonly known as TB, in the Kansas City metro area, Jill Bronaugh, a spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment told HuffPost in an email Monday. Sixty of these active cases are in Wyandotte County, and the remaining seven are in Johnson County. An additional 79 inactive infections, where the person shows no symptoms, have been confirmed in the same areas, with 77 in Wyandotte County and two in Johnson County, Bronaugh said. “The current [metro-area] outbreak is the largest documented outbreak in U.S. history, presently,” she said. This record dates back to the 1950s when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started monitoring and reporting TB cases, she said. Bronaugh noted that there could be more cases not yet confirmed. Last year, KDHE reported 79 active and 213 latent cases in both counties from an outbreak and non-outbreak. There were also two reported TB deaths that were associated with this current outbreak, she said. Deputy Secretary For Public Health Ashley Gossupdatedthe state’s Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee last week about the outbreak, which she called “unprecedented.” The CDC is “on the ground” in Kansas to offer the health department support with the outbreak, which the KDHE first became involved with last summer, she said. “We are trending in the right direction right now. More to come on that. Hopefully, we can get it wound down quickly,” she said Tuesday. Representatives with the CDC did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Monday. TB spreads from a bacterium ― or germ ― that is passed through the air when someone infected coughs, speaks or sings. The disease usually affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys or spine,according to the CDC. Not everyone infected becomes sick. Some people can be diagnosed with inactive cases of TB when they have smaller quantities of the bacterium in their body that are alive but latent. Though people with inactive cases don’t have symptoms and cannot spread the disease to others, they still need treatment to prevent the bacterium ― which can live in the body for years without causing symptoms ― from becoming active,the CDC says. Kansas’ health department said it is offering free TB treatment to those infected who are uninsured or if the treatment isn’t covered by their health insurance. The disease’s symptoms include a long-term cough, fever, chest pain, chills, coughing up blood or sputum, weakness or fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, and night sweats. TB is one of the world’s leading infectious disease killers, with untreated cases potentially resulting in death. Though a vaccine exists, it’s not generally administered in the U.S., which has one of the lowest TB incidence rates in the world, according to the CDC andWorld Health Organization. Outside of the U.S., low- and middle-income countries see 98% of all TB cases. The countries with the highest number of cases are India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Pakistan, according to the WHO. The next four years will change America forever.

Case counts increased among all age groups and among U.S.-born and non-U.S.–born persons during this time, though cases were still disproportionately higher among non-U.S.–born persons and persons from racial and ethnic minority groups. In offering potential reasons for the surge, U.S. health officialsnoted that caseshad risen globally the year before and that resources usually given to TB programs in the U.S. had been “severely taxed” and diverted toward the COVID-19 response instead. “These factors, along with changes in migration volume probably contributed to the decrease in the number of cases observed in 2020, and to the subsequent rise in case counts and rates since 2020,” the CDC said.

        "title": "Judge Lifts Ban On Oath Keepers Leaders’ Visits to D.C., U.S. Capitol",
        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Legal/Justice Reporter, National Desk Elmer Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers who recently had his 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy commuted by President Donald Trump, will be allowed to enter the U.S. Capitol and Washington, D.C., following a brief tug-of-war in court. Monday’sdecisionfrom U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes only days after the Justice Department, through interim U.S. Attorney for D.C. Ed Martin, a prominent Trump ally, first pushed back on an order by Mehta that barred Rhodes and several other Oath Keepers from entering the Capitol or Washington without first consulting prosecutors under conditional terms of their probation. Rhodes wasin the Capitol last weekdoing media interviews and in one interview with the BBC suggested police were responsible for the violence at the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump’s supporters. Martin, once on the board of the Jan. 6 defendant advocacy group Patriot Freedom Project and a supporter of the Stop the Steal movement — he had VIP seating at the Ellipse with Trump allyMichael Flynnat the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally — said in a statement to Politico after Mehta first banned Rhodes: “If a judge decided that Jim Biden, General Mark Milley, or another individual were forbidden to visit America’s capital — even after receiving a last-minute, preemptive pardon from the former President — I believe most Americans would object.” “The individuals referenced in our motion have had their sentences commuted — period, end of sentence,” Martin said. In hisorderMonday, Mehta said that although he recognized the president’s “authority to grant clemency is ‘unlimited’ save for the limits imposed by the Constitution” and he recognized, too, that a pardon, typically speaking, negates the effect of an underlying conviction, a commutation, which was what Trump granted Rhodes and other Oath Keepers, does not erase the conviction itself. This distinction “means that the defendant’s original sentences, including their terms of supervised release remain intact.” “President Trump’s commutation does not alter the court (and the juries’) judgment, it affects only their execution. Dismissing their supervised release therefore is not appropriate,” Mehta wrote. Nevertheless, Mehta said he found Martin’s position “reasonable” because of how the nation’s courts have interpreted presidential acts of clemency in the past. Trump’s executive order commuting the sentences of Oath Keepers to time served as of Jan. 25 could be understood to include “all sanctions imposed for a crime,” and that includes imprisonment, terms of supervised release or probation and fines, Mehta wrote. “The Department’s reading is further supported by the fact that President Trump’s commutation order is unconditional,” Mehta wrote. “Defendants are required to take no further action to receive its benefit.” However, he pointed out, this “unconditional commutation stands in contrast to recent clemency practices.” “Presidents have been explicit when they intend to commute only the custodial portion of a sentence but not the term of supervised release,” Mehta wrote Monday. Trump was more exacting, for example, in 2018, when he commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a first-time nonviolent drug offender whose case rose to prominence after reality TV star Kim Kardashian made Johnson’s case to Trump during an Oval Office visit. Trump commuted her sentence, but he left the terms of her five-year supervised release intact. Trump did not fully pardon her until 2020. Obama did this with commutations during his presidency, as did former President Joe Biden as recently as Jan. 17, when he commuted the sentences of hundreds of people but left the terms of their conditions for release in place. Yet, Mehta wrote, “It is not for this court to divine why President Trump commuted Defendants’ sentences, or to assess whether it was sensible to do so.” The judge’s “sole task,” he said, is to determine the effect of Trump’s executive order commuting and pardoning Jan. 6 defendants. Mehta would not dismiss all of the terms of supervised release but said the court would vacate the order adding location restrictions. When Rhodes was holding media interviews at the Capitol, he had remarked that he hoped to return to the area as often as he could. He’s already made his way to VIP seating at a Trump rally. According toABC, at Trump’s speech in Las Vegas just days ago, Rhodes was tucked into VIP seating on stage where Trump was set to make remarks about his proposal to end taxes on tips. Rhodes wasconvicted of seditious conspiracyand a number of other charges alongside Kelly Meggs, the Florida chapter leader of Oath Keepers, in November 2022. The men were tried alongside Oath Keepers Jessica Watkins and Ken Harrelson as well as an Oath Keepers associate, Thomas Caldwell, but Watkins, Harrelson and Caldwell were acquitted of the seditious conspiracy charge. Other Oath Keepers who were tried on sedition charges separately and convicted include Roberto Minuta, Edward Vallejo, Joseph Hackett and David Moerschel. Trump commuted their sentences, too. Rhodes’ 18-year prison sentence for conspiring to stop the transfer of power on Jan. 6 was the second-longest sentence of all Jan. 6 cases. Meggs received 12 years, Minuta received 45 months, Vallejo and Moerschel each received 36 months, and Hackett received 42 months. Only the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, surpassed Rhodes with a 22-year prison sentence. The next four years will change America forever.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s superstars are tumbling Monday as a competitor from China threatens to upend the artificial-intelligencefrenzythey’ve been feasting on. The S&P 500 was down 1.7% in afternoon trading and heading for its worst day in more than a month. Big Tech stocks took some of the heaviest losses, with Nvidia down 16%, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down 3.2%. Stocks outside of AI-related industries held up much better, though, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 137 points, or 0.3%, as of 12:42 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow has much less of an emphasis on tech than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The shock to financial markets came from China, where a company called DeepSeek said it had developed a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the U.S. government hasrestricted Chinese accessto top AI chips. Skepticism, though, remains about how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the AI supply chain, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrifyvast data centersgobbling up computing power. “It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. DeepSeek’s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide. In Amsterdam, Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML slid 7%. In Tokyo, Japan’s Softbank Group Corp. lost 8.3% to pull closer to where it was before leaping on an announcementtrumpeted by the White Housethat it was joining apartnershipto invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure. And on Wall Street, shares of Constellation Energy lost nearly a fifth of its value, 19.3%. Thecompany has said it would restartthe shutteredThree Mile Island nuclear power plantto supply power for data centers for Microsoft. All the worries sent investors toward bonds, which can be safer investments than any stock. The rush pushed the yield of the 10-year Treasury down to 4.54% from 4.62% late Friday. It’s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast. Before Monday’s drop,Nvidia’sstock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example. Other Big Tech companies had also joined in the frenzy, and their stock prices had benefited too. It was just on Friday that Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg was saying he expects his company to invest up to $65 billion this year and grow its AI teams significantly, while talking up a datacenter in Louisiana that will be so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan. A small group of such companies has become so dominant that they’ve come to be known as the “Magnificent Seven.” These companies — Alphabet,Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Their immense sizes in turn have also given them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. It shows the risk of betting too much on just a few winning stocks, something that market experts call “concentration risk.” That “can feel good when those few names or ideas are on the ascent, but it is even more dangerous when disruptions take place,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Still, he suggested not overreacting to Monday’s sharp swings. “It is possible that the news out of China could be overstated and then we could see a reversal of the recent market moves,” Jacobsen said. “It is also possible that the news is true, but then that would present new investment opportunities.” More big swings may be ahead. Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla are all on the schedule this upcoming week to report how much profit they made at the end of 2024. The pressure is on companies to keep delivering strong profits, particularly after a recent jump in Treasury yields, even with Monday’s decline. When bonds are paying more in interest, they put downward pressure on stock prices. So far, big U.S. companies have been reporting better results than analysts expected. AT&T became the latest on Monday, and its stock rose 6%. In stock markets abroad, movements for broad indexes across Europe and Asia weren’t as forceful as for the big U.S. tech stocks. France’s CAC 40 fell 0.3%, and Germany’s DAX lost 0.5%. In Asia, stocks edged 0.1% lower in Shanghai after asurvey of manufacturersshowed export orders in China dropping to a five-month low. The Federal Reserve holds its latest policy meeting later this week. Traders don’t expect recent weak data to push the Fed to cut its main interest rate. They’re virtually certain the central bank will hold steady, according todata from CME Group. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. ___ This story has been corrected.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "National Investigative Reporter LOS ANGELES — The deadly wildfires in California have taken a lot of Donald Trump’s attention in his first week as president, and although he traveled to Los Angeles to see the damage, his tone in addressing the crisis has been more of blame than of seeking immediate solutions. He has attacked Democratic politicians, and criticized supposed poor forest management and failed water policies. But there’s one much lesser-known party that he has also targeted: a tiny fish called the delta smelt. “He wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt,” Trump wrote on Truth Social about California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Jan. 8, a day after the fires started. “Now the ultimate price is being paid. I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA!” The delta smelt is a tiny silver fish one might mistake for a sardine that lives in waterways in California’s Central Valley, about a five-hour drive north of Los Angeles. It’s endangered ― and so rare that scientists often can’t even catch one when they cast nets in an attempt to count its remaining numbers in the wild. Conservationists say its value is in how it indicates the health of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, an immensely important waterway that provides irrigation to one of the country’s leading producers of almonds, grapes and milk. In order to grow back the smelt’s numbers, the state has limited the amount of water from the delta that’s diverted for human usage and instead has allowed more water to flow from the basin to the sea. This has made the smelt the bane of California farmers’ existence, as they now have access to less water in the region. And Trump has seized onto the fish as a symbol of California’s dysfunction, using it to spreadinaccuraciesabout the state’s water. “What we’re hearing from the president is this complicated mix of him trying to deliver quickly on his campaign promises and all the things that seem to resonate well with some of his stakeholders in the Central Valley and these kind of wild half truths, or maybe misunderstandings of how California water works in the first place,” said Karrigan Bork, the interim director of the University of California Davis’ Center for Watershed Sciences. “We’ve heard everything from California could be getting water from Canada — which just isn’t true — to efforts trying to tie the delta smelt in California’s use of water for ecosystem protection for the fires in LA — which just isn’t true,” Bork said. “So it’s been frankly exhausting trying to keep up with correcting all the misinformation.” Whilereports foundthat some fire hydrants failed to produce water during Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades fire, Trump’s claims that they could have been fixed by redirected water from 300 miles north are factually incorrect, experts say, and also unnecessary. Reservoirs around Los Angeles are at average levels, and the hydrants failed largely due to issues with the local infrastructure. “There’s not a faucet that’s turned off and on,” Bork said. “The problem that LA had with fire hydrants going dry and not having enough water to fight the fire is the same problem you have when you’ve got three people trying to take a shower at your house at the same time, and nobody has water pressure.” Yet, one of the26 executive ordersTrump signed on his first day in office specifically addressed the delta smelt. The directive, “Putting People Over Fish,”orderedhis administration to look into ways to better allow California residents and businesses to pull from the water in the state’s San Joaquin River Basin. “Los Angeles has massive amounts of water available to it. All they have to do is turn the valve,” Trump told reporters at his firstpress briefinglast Tuesday. “It’s to protect the delta smelt. It’s a fish that’s doing poorly anyway.” The delta smelt was first thrust into the national stage in 2009, thanks to Fox News. While the fight over the fish had been tumultuous locally, it wasn’t until it was listed as an endangered species in 2009 under Barack Obama that it got broader attention as a culture war issue. That year Sean Hannity introduced it on asegmentof his prime-time show. During the episode, Hannity proclaimed: “Turn the water back on.” “Farmers in California, they’re losing their land, crops and their livelihood, all because of a 2-inch fish,” he said, before tossing the show to a package featuring then-Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Nunes’ family had owned a dairy farm in California’s San Joaquin Valley while he was growing up, and his constituents saw the give and take of seasonal water resources as the difference between making a livelihood. It was the congressman who introduced Trump to the irritating smelt during his first presidential campaign. As Trump tells it, he first visited the verdant valley with Nunes to hold a rally in 2016. “You’d see an acre, about an acre or two acres, with the most beautiful green plants growing in it, the most beautiful, it’s rich stuff. And you look at the soil, and it’s so rich. That soil is almost the equivalent to, like, Iowa soil. It’s phenomenal,” Trump recalled of his trip at the press conference last Tuesday. Nunes had been an early and ardent supporter of Trump, and the two grew close as they attended fundraisers together across the state, traveling together in Trump’s campaign plane. Speaking at his rally in Tulare on May 27, 2016, Trump repeated Nunes and Hannity’s talking points. “They have farms up here, and they don’t get water. I said, ‘Oh, that’s too bad, do you have a drought?’ And they said, ‘No, we shove it out to sea.’” I said, ‘Why?’ And nobody even knows why. The environmentalists don’t even know why,” Trump told the booing crowd. “They are trying to protect a 3-inch fish.” Nunes told reporters at the time that he was pleased with Trump’s stumping. “I thought he did a great job,” hetold The Fresno Beebefore referring to Trump as “our best chance to improve the water situation here in the Valley.” Trump went on to win over most of the counties in the region in 2016, and Nunes was appointed to be a member of Trump’s first transition team. Weeks before Nunes’ tight Housemidterm racein 2018, Trumpset a deadlinefor the Interior and Commerce departments to review federal water policies in California. For two months, Trump had been stoking the narrative that the state’s water laws were hindering efforts to fight Northern California’s deadly Carr fire. Nunes won his reelection. And in 2020, Trump returned to the valley where in front of a 2,000-person rally, he signed amemorandumthat directed federal officials to capture and store more water from the delta to “provide greater regulatory certainty to agricultural and municipal water users.” California later sued the administration, and the policy was changed under Joe Biden. That new federal policy was just approved late last year. Trump’s new executive order vows to restart the fight over water policies. Water policy experts view Trump’s renewed focus on the state’s water as more pandering than policy. “I think one audience is the Central Valley farmers who did vote for Trump overwhelmingly and have elected a number of conservative Republicans to the House,” Bork said. “I think the other piece of this is playing to his base nationally. I think it’s easy to paint this as wacko leftist California environmentalists who are keeping these hard-working farmers from getting the water they need to go to crops, and who are keeping LA from getting the water that it needs to fight fires.” “He’s seen an opportunity to weigh in on an issue where cities, by and large, have one strong opinion, and rural regions have a different one,” said Brent Haddad, a professor of environmental studies at University of California, Santa Cruz. “In California, the cities are mostly Democratic voters. In the rural regions are mostly Republican voters. And so it’s just an opportunity to throw red meat to Republican voters in California, but it doesn’t advance policy or help the economy or rural people one bit.” The next four years will change America forever.

But Haddad said either outcome wouldn’t matter to Trump. “It’s the most uncharismatic fish you’ll ever meet, OK?” he said. “It’s an endangered species that became a rallying cry.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — TheU.S. Senateconfirmed billionaire investorScott Bessenton Monday to serve as PresidentDonald Trump’s treasury secretary, giving him the delicate balancing act of cutting taxes and curbing deficits while putting forward a plan on tariffs that doesn’t jeopardize growth. The South Carolina resident will be the first openly gay individual in the role, a historic first as Trump seeks novel ways to implement a policy agenda driven by both billionaire business leaders with concerns over regulations and a populist base that wants government leaders to fight for them. Bessent, a past supporter ofDemocratswho once worked for George Soros, has become an enthusiastic supporter of Trump. He has said the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress does not renew key provisions of Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are set to expire Dec. 31, 2025. Negotiating the extension of those tax cuts will be one of his major responsibilities even as he has also pushed for 3% annual growth, significant trims to deficits and increasing domestic oil production by 3 million barrels a day. Bessentcleared the Senate Finance committeeon a 16-11 bipartisan vote. Democratic Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire approved Bessent’s nomination in committee. However, he faced pushback from Democrats on unpaid tax liabilities. Democrats say Bessent has engaged in tax avoidance by failing to pay nearly $1 million in Medicare taxes related to his limited partnership in his hedge fund. Bessent, meanwhile, takes issue with his tax liability to the IRS and is in litigation over the tax bill. He committed during his confirmation hearing that he would pay the tax bill if a court rules against him. Trumptook his time before settlingon Bessent as his nominee. He also mulled over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped for commerce secretary. The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president’s fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He is also a member of the president’s National Economic Council. With Trump’s return to the White House and hisRepublican Partycontrolling majorities in Congress, hisoutsider Cabinet choicesare getting confirmed despite initial skepticism and opposition from both sides of the aisle.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians streamed into Gaza’s most heavily destroyed area on Monday after Israel opened the north for the first time since the early weeks of the war with Hamas, a dramatic reversal of their exodus 15 months ago. As thefragile ceasefireheld into a second week, Israel was informed by Hamas that eight of the hostages to be freed during the deal’s first phase are dead. Joyous crowdsof Palestinians, some holding babies or pushing wheelchairs, walked along a seaside road all day and into the night, carrying bedrolls, bottles of water and other belongings. A few armed, masked Hamas fighters flashed a victory sign. The crowd was watched over by Israeli tanks on a nearby hill. The United Nations said over 200,000 people were observed moving north in Gaza on Monday morning alone. Palestinians who have been shelteringin squalid tent campsand former schools are eager to return to their homes — even thoughthey are likely damaged or destroyed. Many had feared that Israel wouldmake their displacement permanent. Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her damaged but habitable Gaza City home. She saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year. “It was a long trip, but a happy one,” she said. Many saw their return as an act of steadfastness after Israel’s military campaign, launched in response to the Hamas militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The return was also seen as a repudiation of U.S.President Donald Trump’s suggestionthat many Palestinians be resettled in Egypt and Jordan, which those countries have rejected. Whether hostages are still alive inside Gaza has been a heartbreaking question for waiting families who have pushed Israel’s government to reach a deal to free them, fearing that time was running out. Before Monday’s announcement, Israel believed that at least 35 of the about 90 hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack and still in Gaza were dead. Government spokesman David Mencer told journalists that a list received overnight from Hamas on the status of the 33 hostages being freed under the ceasefire’s first phase showed eight were dead. The families have been informed, he said, adding that the information matched what Israeli intelligence had believed. The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 assault and abducted another 250. Israel responded with an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. In all, around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced. Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who waited for days near the crossing point for northern Gaza, described scenes of jubilation, with people singing, praying and crying. “It’s the joy of return,” said Abu Matter, whose relatives were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. “We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.” The opening was delayed for two days as Israel said Hamas had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Local medical officials said Israeli forces opened fire at the waiting crowd and killed several Palestinians over the weekend. Israel’s military said it fired warning shots at approaching groups it deemed a threat. Mediatorsresolved the dispute overnight. Hamas called the return “a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.” In the war’s opening days, Israel ordered the evacuation of the north and sealed it off after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled south while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting andthe worst destruction. “This is our house, four stories. You can’t see them,” one returning man, gesturing to a pile of rubble, said in an AP video. Palestinians were crossing on foot without inspection through part ofthe Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles opened later on Gaza’s main north-south highway, where traffic was backed up for around 3 kilometers (2 miles). Under the ceasefire agreement, vehicles are to be inspected for weapons before entering the north. An Egyptian official said Egyptian contractors, along with a U.S. firm, run checkpoints that inspect vehicles heading via Salahuddin road. The contractors are part of an Egyptian-Qatari committee implementing the ceasefire, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Israel had delayed the crossing’s opening, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. Israel said she should have been released before four female soldiers who werefreed on Saturday. Israel also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on the hostages to be freed. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing. Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages by Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. Another three hostages should be released on Saturday as previously planned. Defense Minister Israel Katz said anyone violating the ceasefire or threatening Israeli forces “will bear the full cost.” Israel’s military has warned Palestinians not to approach its forces, which have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza.

Some expressed only mistrust toward the Palestinians. But others were empathetic. “Let them come back home safely and conduct a normal life,” said one woman, Rachel Osher. “We also want it.

In a statement on social media, Fort Worth ISD said it is aware of the post, which has “caused concern among” the school district. “We take this matter very seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation to understand the circumstances and ensure appropriate actions are taken,” the statement reads. The school district told KXAS-TV in Fort Worththat the teacher won’t be on campus during the investigation. Since PresidentDonald Trump, who campaigned on mass deportations of immigrants, took office last week, ICE has ramped up arrests, detaining nearly 1,000 immigrants on Sunday. Trump authorized ICE to go into schools and churches,ending a policy that was put into effect in 2011.

        "title": "Why FTC Employees Are Frustrated With Biden’s Former Chair Lina Khan",
        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost Hundreds of Federal Trade Commission workers who unionized last year failed to reach a long-term contract with the agency’s outgoing Democratic chair, the aggressive antitrust enforcer Lina Khan, setting up a likely battle with its new GOP leadership under President Donald Trump. In an email to a labor official obtained by HuffPost, an FTC employee involved in the union effort expressed frustration at not securing a multiyear deal before Khan, who’s considered a union ally, stepped aside as chair after Trump’s inauguration last week. Instead, the workers, who are represented by the National Treasury Employees Union, agreed to an“interim” contractwith no set duration. The temporary agreement means they will probably end up bargaining with Trump’s new pick for chair, the Republican commissioner Andrew Ferguson. Trump’s agency heads are expected to follow his lead on federal workplace matters, including trimming staff, loosening job protections and cracking down on remote work. Long-term protections for remote work were one of the main sticking points in the FTC talks. Khan’s office had offered a long-term contract as the Biden administration came to a close, but the union’s negotiators wouldn’t recommend it to members for approval, according to the email. “We would never have ratified it; our [union] lawyers correctly called it ‘garbage’ to an emergency members meeting,” the employee wrote. “Not gonna lie — it was a profoundly frustrating experience.” Khan, the FTC and the NTEU all declined to comment on the contract talks. “Trump’s agency heads are expected to follow his lead on federal workplace matters, including trimming staff, loosening job protections and cracking down on remote work.” The union fight inside the commission reflects broader tensions across the federal workforce, with the new administration signaling job cuts and a purge of civil servants viewed as disloyal to the Trump agenda. Among Trump’s first moves in the White House was signing executive orders aimed atending teleworkand reclassifying tens of thousands of federal employees to make iteasier to fire them. Federal unions anticipated such hostility and hustled to bargain three- and four-year contracts last year, hoping they could insulate employees deep into Trump’s term. Some federal workers also tried to organize their offices for the first time in order to secure basic union protections. That was the case at the FTC, where a group that included attorneys, economists and statisticians voted415 to 25in favor of joining the NTEU in late September. (Many FTC workers in other job categories were already unionized.) The NTEU said at the time that workers had raised concerns about “access to telework” and “potential politicization of the civil service,” a clear reference to a possible Trump presidency. The timeline left a little under four months for a first contract to be negotiated and ratified before Inauguration Day. The FTC employee said management was slow to bargain. The union sent a full contract proposal for review in mid-December; management submitted a full counter proposal on Jan. 17, the Friday before inauguration, according to the FTC employee’s email. A source familiar with Khan’s thinking said she was reluctant to offer a long-term contract with broad telework protections, fearing it would put a bull’s-eye on the agency’s back with the White House and Capitol Hill Republicans. Former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, agreed to a four-year union contract late last yearextending teleworkat the agency. Trump publicly rebuked him and GOP members of Congress questioned him in a House Oversight Committee hearing. The source said Khan had offered to extend the FTC’s current telework policy — requiring two days in the office per two-week pay period — for another six months, but the union pressed for a longer-term guarantee. With limited time to finalize a contract, labor allies of the NTEU reached out to Khan to urge a deal, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. The outreach effort included the office of Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO labor federation. A spokesperson for Shuler declined to comment.

Khan won many fans within the labor movement during her term as chair. She implemented a landmarkban on noncompete agreementsand helpedsinkthe merger of Kroger and Albertsons, which she said would drive down wages for unionized grocery store workers. Her ambitious agenda and willingness to challenge corporate power made her one of the stars of the Biden era. It also earned her a following among a subset of Republicans who say they favor strong antitrust enforcement, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Vice President JD Vance. The endorsement by such “Khanservatives” has prompted debate within the anti-monopoly movement over whether these Republicans areworthworking alongsideornot to be trusted. “A source familiar with Khan’s thinking said she was reluctant to offer a long-term contract with strong telework protections for fear it would put a bullseye on the agency’s back.” Whatever GOP support there may be for Khan’s vision, the FTC appears headed in a different direction under Ferguson. After he took over as chairman, FergusonsaidTrump would “end the previous administration’s assault on the American way of life.” He alsomoved quicklyto unwind the FTC’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, calling DEI “a scourge” and praising Trump for hisordersundermining it. While the FTC is an independent agency, Ferguson’s statements so far suggest he’ll try to fulfill Trump’s vision for the federal workforce. “I take seriously my obligation as an officer of the United States to follow the lawful orders of the president of the United States,” Ferguson said Thursday. The interim deal includes core union safeguards, including a grievance procedure that can protect against discipline and firings. It also states that fully remote workers — that is, those who live far from an FTC office — will be entitled to that arrangement for a period of three years, unless management determines they have “performance deficiencies.” But that provision could be wiped out in a full-term deal bargained under Ferguson. And if the two sides can’t agree on a contract in bargaining, the dispute could end up before a federal impasse panel led by Trump appointees. During Trump’s first presidency, that panelenabledthe administration to essentially rewrite collective bargaining agreements to be less worker-friendly.

        "content": "Trends Reporter, HuffPost Vice President JD Vancesaid that lowering grocery prices will likely “take a little bit of time” after being pressed in a tense interview on CBS’s“Face the Nation.” Host Margaret Brennan noted thatPresident Donald Trumpand Vance had vowed to slash grocery prices during theircampaignbefore asking which of the 20-plus executive orders that Trump signed this past week would immediately offer Amerian consumers some relief for staggering prices. Vance responded vaguely. “We have done a lot, and there have been a number of executive orders that have caused, already, jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices,” he told Brennan in the interview that aired Sunday. Without specifying which orders would decrease prices for Americans, Vance continued, “More capital investment, more job creation in our economy, is one of the things that’s going to drive down prices for all consumers, but also raise wages so that people can afford to buy the things that they need.” “So grocery prices aren’t going to come down?” Brennan interjected, prompting Vance to dish out a rather spicy reply. “No, Margaret, prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time, right? The president has been president for all of five days. I think that, in those five days, he’s accomplished more than Joe Biden did in four years,” Vance insisted. He added, “It’s been an incredible breakneck pace of activity. We’re going to work with Congress.” Vance then touted “all of the stuff that we’ve done on energy to explore more energy reserves and to develop more energy resources [for] the United States of America,” saying this would “specifically” bring down everyday costs. He then said that “one of the main drives of increased prices under the Biden administration” was a ”massive increase in energy prices.” “Donald Trump has already taken multiple executive actions that are going to lower energy prices, and I do believe that means consumers are going to see lower prices at the pump and at the grocery store, but it’s going to take a little bit of time,” Vance added. “Rome wasn’t built in a day.” Brennan hasn’t been the only one demanding answers about Trump and Vance’s promises. On Sunday, Sen.Elizabeth Warren(D-Mass.) and other Democratic lawmakers wrote apointed letterasking Trump why he has yet to address the cost of food despite signing multiple executive orders during his first week back in office.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Sen.Adam Schiff(D-Calif.) on Sunday singled out a possible reasonDonald Trumpchose to fire several inspectors general from major federal agencies, while noting that the president “broke the law.” Trump on Friday evening reportedlydismissed at least 15 inspectors generalfrom their roles. The firings appear to violate federal legislation that mandates that congressional lawmakers be given 30-day notice of an intent to dismiss inspectors general. “He broke the law,” Schiff told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And not just any law, but a law meant to crowd out waste, fraud and abuse. And yeah, the remedies Congress has.” Schiff warned Americans that Trump’s decision to move forward with these dismissals carries risks given the post involves providing independent audits, inspections and investigations of government agencies. “The American people, if we don’t have good and independent inspector generals, are going to see the swamp refill,” Schiff told NBC’s Kristen Welker. Schiff cited Trump’s move to launch his own meme coin just a few days before his inauguration, suggesting the president’s goal with these firings could possibly be “to remove anyone that’s going to call the public attention to his malfeasance.” Schiff was not the only Democrat to blast Trump’s move. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the action amounted to a “chilling purge.” “This is Donald Trump’s way of telling us he’s terrified of accountability,” Schumer said. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) also said he would like “further explanation from President Trump.” Trump on Saturday defended his action,telling reportersthat firing attorneys general is a “very common thing to do.” “It’s a first standard thing to do, very much like the U.S. attorneys,” he added. This is not the first time Trump has fired federal watchdogs. At the end of his first term in office, he fired the attorneys general of five Cabinet departments, prompting Congress to pass a law in 2022 that increased the removal protections for the post.

The email sent to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Inspector General Christi Grimm announcing her ouster on Friday evening referenced the “changing priorities” of the new administration,according to ABC News. Sources told the network the same template was used to dismiss other federal watchdogs. According to The Washington Post, Trump fired the inspectors general of the departments of Defense, State, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Energy, Commerce, Treasury and Agriculture. He also dismissed the watchdogs of the Environmental Protection Agency, Small Business Administration and the Social Security Administration.

        "content": "General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Fox NewshostMaria Bartiromoon Sunday told Rep.James Comer(R-Ky.) that her audience was “disappointed” that his probe of former PresidentJoe Bidenproduced no prosecutions. After a failed effort to pin corruption charges on Biden for alleged undue influence in business dealings with son Hunter Biden and other relatives, the investigation by the House Oversight Committee chair and GOP membersultimately fizzled. “You did a very good job,” Bartiromo told Comer on her “Sunday Morning Futures” program. “You identified the bank statements, you identified whistleblowers and you did a very deep investigation, we all covered it. ... But I’ve got to tell you, my audience is a little disappointed.” Noting thelast-minute preemptive pardonsthat Biden granted to family members, Bartiromo told Comer: “Should we just expect after all that work you put into it, after all the conversations we’ve had, they got away with it?” she asked, perhaps forgetting that the investigation never produced the proof necessary for an impeachment. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), then the top Democrat on the committee, concluded: “What do you call a hellbent 20-month impeachment drive whose managers finally just dissolve into compulsive repetition of thoroughly discredited and meaningless accusations? I would call it a complete exoneration of the target of their pathetic attacks.” Comer didn’t directly address Bartiromo’s criticism, but did say he hoped his investigation wasn’t for naught and the ball is gonna be in [attorney general nominee] Pam Bondi’s court.” He predicted Biden’s pardons would not hold up legally and falsely claimed that Biden “didn’t have the guts to tell anybody why he did it.” Biden spelled out that he was concerned thatpartisan attacks against his familywould continue under Trump. Not surprisingly, Comerdoesn’t seem to be as enthusiasticabout investigating the Trump family’s financial dealings. “IfDemocratstruly care about presidential ethics, they must first acknowledge the evidence we uncovered,” a Comer spokeperson told the Oversight Committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Reporter, HuffPost In his first remarks as President Donald Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth referred to two U.S. military bases by their former Confederate names, appearing to hint that he might possibly restore them. Speaking to reporters on Monday― his first day on the job after being narrowly confirmed by the Senate ― the National Guard veteran laid out what he envisions for the Pentagon under Trump’s administration. Hegseth expressed support for the president’s executive orders that would scrap the military’s diversity and inclusion initiatives, reinstate soldiers “who were pushed out because of COVID mandates” and create an Iron Dome-like missile defense system for the United States. “Every moment that I’m here, I’m thinking about the guys and gals in Guam, in Germany, Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, on missile defense sites and aircraft carriers,” the former Fox News host said. “Our job is lethality and readiness and war-fighting.” Pete Hegseth, in his first remarks as defense secretary, refers to Fort Liberty as \"Fort Bragg\"pic.twitter.com/GkjQlSZWAZ Fort Benning, as it was formerly known, sits on the Georgia-Alabama border and is home to the Army Infantry School. It wasnamed after Henry L. Benning, a racist judge and Confederate brigadier general who led a Georgia military unit in Gen. John Hood’s division of the Army of Northern Virginia. “By the time the north shall have attained the power, the black race will be in a large majority, and then we will have black governors, black legislatures, black juries, black everything,”Benning wrote to the Virginia secession conventionin 1861. “Is it to be supposed that the white race will stand for that? It is not a supposable case.” North Carolina’s Fort Bragg, as it was formerly known,is one of the world’s biggest military bases, home to both the Army’s XVIII Airborne Corps and Special Forces Command. The fort, which was first a camp, was named after Braxton Bragg,a slave owner and Confederate leaderwho is widely considered one of the worst generals of the Civil War. In 2021,Congress overrode Trump’s vetoto pass a lawchanging the names of all Pentagon assetsassociated with the Confederacy. Among thosewere nine U.S. military bases, including Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, which in 2023 were renamed Fort Moore and Fort Liberty, respectively. Fort Moorewas named in honorof Lt. Gen. Harold “Hal” Moore and his wife, Julia Moore. Hal Moore served at the fort throughout his military career and fought in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, while Julia Moore’s attention to families of dead soldiers helped reform the Army’s casualty notification process. Both Moores are buried at Fort Moore Cemetery. Hegseth hasnot attempted to hide his disdain for the new names, saying it breaks military tradition and should revert back to being named after the treasonous Americans.

And Hal Moore’s a great guy. But like, there’s also a generational link that breaks when you rename Benning and Bragg. Like, where’d you serve? Bragg. Where’d you serve? Benning. Where’d you serve, now Liberty? Like, it’s just, it’s garbage. It’s all, it’s just, let’s just crap all over it.” On X, Bloomberg reporter Roxana Tiron suggested that Hegseth’s references on Monday were “likely intentional.” Though he could use his position as defense secretary to advocate for reverting the names to Confederate generals, those changes would still require congressional approval.

The Kansas City Chiefs’32-29 victoryover the Buffalo Bills ― which set up the Chiefs for a third straight Super Bowl appearance ― prompted the president to post on hisTruth Socialplatform: “Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs. What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers.” Trump also hailed the Bills’ “tremendous season” and said the team “will do a lot of winning long into the future!!!” See the full post: The Chiefs will seek a third Super Bowl victory in a row with the team’s Feb. 9 clash against the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Trump has a history, of sorts, with both sides of the 2025 Super Bowl.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Politics Reporter, HuffPost A contested election for North Carolina’s state Supreme Court may leave the apparent winner in an unusual position — having the outcome of the vote decided by fellow justices on the bench whose spouses gave campaign contributions to her opponent. In November, the incumbent, Associate Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat, appeared to barely eke out a victory over her challenger, Jefferson Griffin, a Republican seeking to move up from the state Court of Appeals. After two recounts, theNorth Carolina election board tally has Riggs winning by 734 votesout of more than 5.5 million cast. But Griffin challenged the outcome in court, seeking to invalidate more than 60,000 mail-in and early in-person votes. With Riggs recusing herself, thestate Supreme Court denied a request by Griffin to fast-track the case,and sent it to a lower state court. But it also kept the election board from certifying Riggs as the winner. The dispute has bounced between state and federal courts, witha federal appeals court to hear the case Mondayon whether it should be in the state courts. Where the outcome is decided may be pivotal. Riggs has sought to keep the case at the federal level, while Griffin asked the GOP-controlled state Supreme Court, to which he’s trying to be elected, to fast-track it. “We have always known that Griffin’s baseless challenges should be heard and decided in federal court,” Riggs said Thursday in a statement. “It’s telling that he is already trying to delay the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals’ review in light of the North Carolina Supreme Court’s order. Voters decide elections and deserve a swift resolution from our federal courts.” The state Supreme Court’s 5-2 GOP majority is an obvious reason Griffin might prefer his chances there. But he may like it for another reason: He has described his relationship with Chief Justice Paul Newby as a mentor/mentee one, and Newby’s spouse, along with that of Associate Justice Tamara Barringer, contributed to Griffin’s campaign, according to campaign finance records. Those records showthat Newby’s wife, Macon Newby, contributed $6,400 to Griffin’s campaign in June 2023. Brent Barringer, Tamara Barringer’s husband, also gave Griffin at least $6,400 for his Supreme Court campaign, according tocampaign finance records. Justices Newby and Barringer have not recused themselves from decisions in the case so far, and Newby has sounded sympathetic to Griffin’s claims in his writings. Neither justice responded immediately to a request for comment left with their offices Monday. On Thursday, Newby wrote that Griffin led by almost 10,000 votes on election night before trailing by 734. “That is a highly unusual course of events. It is understandable that petitioner and many North Carolina voters are questioning how this could happen,” he wrote. (It’s not actually an unusual course of events: Electoral leads change all the time as additional ballots are counted.) He also defended Griffin’s right to challenge the outcome, which has been criticized in part because in previous elections,Griffin himself voted using the military absentee ballot― the type of vote he hopes to invalidate now. In July 2023, Griffintold the North State Journalthat he considered Newby a longtime supporter. “The Chief Justice has been a good friend and mentor for a long time back from my days when I moved to Raleigh and was an assistant DA in Wake County,” he said, according to the newspaper. Griffin also reportedly said he was on the bench for two years with another associate justice, Richard Dietz, when Dietz was at the state Court of Appeals, and that he had good relationships with the three other GOP associate justices, Barringer, Trey Allen, and Phil Berger Jr. While the donations may raise eyebrows, they appear not to be prohibited underthe state’s code of judicial conduct. The code explicitly states that spouses of judges may engage in political activity. And the practice is not confined to the court’s Republicans. Charles Walton ― husband of Associate Justice Anita Earls, Riggs’ fellow Democrat on the court ― contributed more than $1,800 to Riggs in 2023 and 2024, according tocampaign finance records.

        "content": "Associate Reporter Actor Josh O’Connor said he doesn’t mind that “Challengers” didn’t receive any Academy Awards nominations. “All the nominations are so good this year,”O’Connor told IndieWirein an interview published Sunday. “There’s so many great films, but then I do think that every year. I’m always amazed what artists create. I don’t mind.” “Challengers,” a 2024 film set in the tennis world starring O’Connor, Zendaya and Mike Faist, was shut out of the 2025 Oscars despite positive critical reviews. “Challengers” won Best Score at the Golden Globes in January, as well as other film awards, including from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. The movie’s music is also nominated for a Grammy and Critics’ Choice Award. Instead of “Challengers,” the Academy nominated “The Brutalist,” “Conclave,” “Emilia Pérez,” “Wicked” and “The Wild Robot” for Best Score this year. O’Connor, who was at the Sundance Film Festival promoting his newest movie, “Rebuilding,” told IndieWire that he’s lucky he got to make two movies that he loves in 2024: “La Chimera” and “Challengers.” “I’m just so thrilled that people like them and got to see them,” he said. O’Connor also addressed rumors that he would be the next James Bond,telling Deadline on Saturday, “If I am Bond, I don’t know about it.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

        "content": "Legal/Justice Reporter, National Desk Andrew Taake’s legal troubles might not be over — even though the Texas man was just pardoned by President Donald Trump after being convicted of spraying police with bear spray and using a metal whip to assault them while they defended the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. According to a review of public court records and confirmed by the Houston district attorney’s office on Monday, Taake is still considered “at large” for the alleged 2016 crime of soliciting a minor online under 17 years old with the expectation that the individual “would engage in sexual contact” with him. Taake, who was sentenced to six years in prison for assaulting police on Jan. 6, was out on bond for the solicitation charge when he was storming the Capitol. The Harris County district attorney’s office said Taake was charged with soliciting someone “believed to be younger than 17 years of age” on May 25, 2016, just one day after the solicitation allegedly occurred. He received a bond of $20,000; with it secured, he was released from jail. However, his bond was revoked in September 2021. Today, “he is still at large” for that offense, a spokesperson for the district attorney in Harris County told HuffPost. Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare also told HuffPost on Monday, “Before Andrew Taake’s release from custody in Florence, Colorado, on January 20, a member of our Harris County Sheriff’s Office Fugitive Warrants Division requested that federal authorities hold him, due to his pending warrant in Harris County. That request was filed back in 2022. The Bureau of Prisons informed our office they must have a certified warrant to prevent Taake’s release. Although a clerk faxed a copy of that warrant on January 15, Taake was released five days later, in accordance with President Trump’s Pardon order.” “Re-arresting individuals, like Taake, who were released with pending State warrants, will require significant resources,” Teare continued. “Know that we are already in the process of tracking Taake down, as he must answer for [the] 2016 charge of soliciting a minor online.” An attorney for Taake did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. His Jan. 6 activities only came to light thanks to an amateur sting led by a woman using the dating app Bumble. AsHuffPost reportedin-depth in 2021, the woman said she used the app to connect with men in the Washington area who she thought may have been at the Capitol. It was her “civic duty” to gain information, and there was “comically minimal ego-stroking” necessary to prompt men to expose themselves, she said. Taake took the bait. Though in their chats he regurgitated popular right-wing conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and who he believed was responsible for the assault on the Capitol — Taake insisted it was “antifa” — he nonetheless boasted about himself. When asked if he was “near all the action,” he said he was and “from the very beginning.” He sent her pictures of himself too, claiming he had just been sprayed with a chemical irritant by police. The woman connected with roughly a dozen men who were in Washington on Jan. 6 or had attended Trump’s rally that morning. Just three admitted they were all on Capitol grounds illegally, Taake included. All the woman had to do was suggest they tell her more, and when she had enough to send to the FBI, that’s exactly what she did, she told HuffPost in July 2021. After his arrest, Taake ended uppleading guiltyto a single count of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon in December 2023. In the days since Trump doled out pardons to Jan. 6 rioters, another former defendant has been arrested. Just last week, authorities arrested Daniel Ball, 39, of Florida, on a felony gun charge stemming from May 2023. Ball had been unable to appear in Florida court to face the gun charge since he was already detained for crimes at the Capitol. Court records show that the gun charge was filed when the FBI turned up a loaded rifle, ammunition and explosive devices in his possession that, according to prosecutors, were the same kind of devices he admitted to using to attack police. The federal judge who oversaw Ball’s Jan. 6 case called his conduct on that day “some of the most violent and serious offenses from the Capitol insurrection.” The next four years will change America forever.

        "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/",
        "content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — All SenateDemocratsco-sponsored a symbolic resolution condemning PresidentDonald Trumpfor pardoning rioters who have attacked police. The resolution, which would have no practical effect if the Senate adopted it, is narrow in scope, stating simply that “the Senate disapproves of any pardons for individuals who were found guilty of assaulting Capitol Police officers.” Trump’s sweeping clemency action on his first day in office pardoned everyone charged with crimes connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, including the most violent offenders who attacked police. The only exceptions were for 14 members of militant groups charged with seditious conspiracy; Trump commuted their prison sentences while stopping short of a full pardon. Democrats’ resolution focuses only on the subset of rioters who attacked police. Of the more than 1,600 rioters charged with crimes, more than 600 were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement, including more than 169 charged with using a weapon or injuring an officer. “I refuse to allow President Trump to rewrite what happened on January 6th —armed insurrectionists, incited by Trump himself, broke into the U.S. Capitol and violently assaulted Capitol Police officers in their attempt to overthrow a free and fair election,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the lead sponsor of the resolution, said in a press release. “Insurrectionists cracked the ribs of police officers and smashed spinal disks. Donald Trump’s pardons are a wholesale endorsement of political violence — as long as it serves Donald Trump.” Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), who recently visited Trump at his Florida estate, initially didn’t join his colleagues in support of the move, but added his name after Murray announced the resolution publicly on Monday morning. Fettermandeclined to answerquestions about the Jan. 6 pardons last week. Murray’s office said the senator would ask the Senate for “unanimous consent” to adopt the resolution. A single senator can block the request. No Republicans co-sponsored the Democratic resolution. Just a handful of GOP senators have spoken out against Trump’s pardons, while most of the partyhas stayed quiet. Over the weekend, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Trump made a mistake pardoning the violent Jan. 6 offenders but he conceded Trump had the power to do so. “He had the legal authority to do it but I fear that you will get more violence,” Graham said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Pardoning the people who went into the Capitol and beat up a police officer violently I think was a mistake, because it seems to suggest that’s an OK thing to do.” But Vice President JD Vance defended Trump’s blanket pardons for violent Jan. 6 pardons, even though he said two weeks ago that “obviously” some of them should not get pardons. “I think he made the right decision,” Vance said of Trump during an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “Violence against a police officer is not justified, but that doesn’t mean that you should have Merrick Garland’s weaponized Department of Justice expose you to incredibly unfair process, to denial of constitutional rights,” Vance added of people who received jury trials.

        "title": "JD Vance clashes with Catholic bishops as GOP line on religion evolves",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows BySteve Benen On the first full day of his second term as president, Donald Trump attended a national prayer service in Washington, where he sat and listened to the bishop of the local Episcopal Diocese. It quickly became quite memorable: The Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Buddespoke truth to power, urging the newly inaugurated president to reconsiderhis attacks on marginalized communities. Trump reacted furiously, and among Republicans, he was hardly alone.House Speaker Mike Johnsonand the newWhite House press secretarycondemned the bishop’s sermon, and Fox News personalitiesrepeatedlylashedoutatBudde on the air. One GOP lawmaker went so far as to introduce a congressional resolutionto formally condemnher remarks — and it quickly picked up20 Republican co-sponsors. It served as a timely reminder thattoo often in GOP circles, religion is treated as something that must be celebrated, protected and respected — just so long as the faith community is telling the party what it wants to hear. In fact, the first week of the Trump era ended on a similar note to the way in which it began. JD Vance sat down with CBS’s Margaret Brennan for his first on-air interview as vice president, and the “Face the Nation” host reminded her guest that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week condemned some of Trump’s executive orders, most notably the administration’s new policy on allowing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to enter houses of worship. “Do you personally support the idea of conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school?” the host asked. The Ohio Republican, who is himself a Roman Catholic,replied: Of course, if you have a person who is convicted of a violent crime, whether they’re an illegal immigrant or a non-illegal immigrant, you have to go and get that person to protect the public safety. That’s not unique to immigration. But let me just address this particular issue, Margaret. Because as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement. And I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?  So, a few things. Right off the bat, it was curious to hear Vance say that officials have a responsibility to “get” those convicted of violent crimes “to protect the public safety.”Trump’s pardons for violent Jan. 6 felonssuggest the Republican White House has already rejected the vice president’s assertion. What's more, it’s unusual, to put it mildly, to see a prominent American political leader use such pointed language in reference to Catholic leaders. “Are they actually worried about their bottom line?” is the kind of question that, I suspect, will not be well received by the USCCB. But let’s also not brush past the larger context. In recent years, in instances in which the Biden administration disagreed with the Roman Catholic Church, Trump and other Republicans werequick to accuse the former Democratic presidentof being “against God,” “against the Bible” and “essentially against religion.” At the Republican National Convention, one speakercondemned Biden— by all accounts, a devout Catholic — as a “Catholic in name only.” What are the chances Republicans will hear similar talk after a week in which party leaders launched a hysterical offensive against Budde and publicly questioned whether Catholic bishops are principally concerned with “their bottom line”?

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows BySteve Benen In April 2020, when Donald Trump was ostensibly focused on an intensifying and deadly pandemic, the then-president did something entirely unexpected late on a Friday night: Hefiredthe inspector general for the intelligence community. A month later, again on a Friday night, the Republicanalso firedthe inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. A couple of weeks later, he did the same thing to the State Department’s inspector general — late on a Friday night. The New York Timesreportedthat the White House appeared to be engaged in a “power play against semi-independent inspectors general across the government,” driven by the president’s “impatience with independent voices within the government that he considers disloyal.” The Washington Post’s David Ignatius similarlycalled outTrump for launching “a relentless campaign — waged even in the midst of the pandemic — against people and institutions that can hold him accountable.” In the final year of his first term, the Republican ended upousting four of these watchdog officials. As his second term gets underway, Trump is picking up where he left off. My MSNBC colleagueClarissa-Jan Lim highlightedthe president’s latest move against inspectors general — who were once again targeted late on a Friday night. President Donald Trump fired multiple inspectors general late on Friday, removing the independent watchdogs tasked with investigating abuse and impropriety in federal agencies in a move that potentially violates federal law. ... The exact number of inspectors general who were dismissed is unclear. NBC News reported that at least 12 were fired. The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the actions, reported the number as at least 14 across several agencies.  Right off the bat, the obvious problem with such a move is the apparent motivation: Inspectors general are responsible for investigating internal wrongdoing, possible ethical lapses, alleged corruption and fraud, and mismanagement. For Trump, who is no stranger to corruption accusations, to target these watchdogs raises all kinds of questions about the kind of actions the new administration hopes to get away with in the coming weeks, months and years. Relatedly, one of the fired inspectors generaltold The Washington Post, “It’s a widespread massacre. Whoever Trump puts in now will be viewed as loyalists, and that undermines the entire system.” But perhaps most important of all is the apparent fact that the White House’s action is at odds with federal law. TheNew York Times reporton the developments explained, “The firings defied a law that requires presidents to give Congress 30 days’ advance notice before removing any inspector general, along with reasons for the firing. Just two years ago, Congress strengthened that provision byrequiring the notice to include a ‘substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons” for the removal.’” It led Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer, to tell MSNBC’s Jen Psaki that Trump’s move was “a nakedly illegal action.” Not surprisingly, congressional Democrats wasted little time in expressing outrage. Senate Minority Leader Schumer called it “a chilling purge,” and “a preview of the lawless approach Donald Trump and his administration is taking.” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said the move was “a brazen attempt to rig these offices to look the other way when violations of law take place.” Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, labeled it Trump’s “midnight massacre.” By way of a defense, the president told reporters that his move was “a very common thing to do.” This was, of course, the opposite of the truth: Since the existing law was created, there have been no such mass firings of inspectors general. But just as important was the reaction from congressional Republicans. Four years ago, when Trump targeted inspectors general,a variety of GOP officials pushed back. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa — by any fair measure, a leader for many years on protecting inspectors general —was especially incensed. But in the aftermath of Trump’s Friday night firings,one GOP officialafter anotherlined upto expresssupportorindifference. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” conceded that the firings appeared to be “technically” illegal, but the South Carolinian endorsed the move anyway. Even Grassley said, “There may be good reason the IGs were fired,” though the Iowan said he’d like “further explanation.” The president's Friday night move was indefensible. The GOP reaction added insult to injury. As for the near future, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, which represents inspectors general, issued a statement questioning the legality of Trump’s purge, suggesting some important court fights are on the horizon.

Though MAGA world had misconstrued Petro’s position as an opposition to deportation flights generally, hehad objectedto U.S. military planes being used. He had demanded that Colombian migrants be treated with dignity. Though MAGA world had misconstrued Petro’s position as an opposition to deportation flights generally, he had objected to U.S. military planes being used. “A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,”Petro said in a post on X. “That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants... In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.” For a fleeting moment, it looked like going after Trump was a political risk Petro was willing to take. Responding to Trump’s announcement that he’d put tariffs on Colombian imports that would start at 25% on all goods and quickly rise to 50% and the promise of a “Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations on the Colombian Government Officials, and all Allies and Supporters,” Petro responded on X that those sanctions “do not scare me”and said that Colombiais “not anyone’s colony.” At one point, Petro even equated Trump with a “white enslaver.” “I resisted torture, and I will resist you,” Petro said at one point in Spanish. “I don’t want enslavers near Colombia. We’ve had enough, and we freed ourselves. What I want for Colombia are lovers of freedom. If you cannot stand beside me, I will turn elsewhere.” He added: “You may kill me, but I will survive through my people, who existed before yours, in the Americas. We are the people of the winds, the mountains, the Caribbean Sea, and of freedom.” But in the end, the lofty Latin American resistance rhetoric was for naught. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday that Colombia “has agreed to all of President Trump’s terms,” including the “unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.” The Colombian government issued a face-saving statementclaiming that its impasse with the United States had been resolved through diplomatic efforts. “We will continue to receive Colombians deported under conditions that guarantee dignity and respect as citizens with full rights,” part of the statement read. Sunday must have been especially challenging for Latinos who said they voted for Trump believing he would improve the economy, and didn’t believe he would be this extreme this soon against their communities and the Latin American countries they share origins with. The misinformation that the MAGA world was circulating Sunday — that Colombia was blocking deportation flights in general — was distressing but not surprising.  To suggest that Colombia hasn’t been a willing partner in the long history of American immigration enforcement policy is laughable. According to the Department of Homeland Security,between 2014 and 2023, 22% of Colombian nationals encountered by U.S. immigration authorities were repatriated.Telemundo cited Witness at the Border tracking datathat between 2020 and 2024, Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights, the fifth-most of any country. In August,Colombia joined the United States and Panamain issuing a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to managing migration flows through the Darién Gap. This trilateral agreement emphasized collaborative efforts to enhance security and address irregular migration, underscoring Colombia’s ongoing role as a reliable partner. Military deportations send an entirely different message, one that understandably stirs painful memories of U.S. interventionism in Latin America. However, military deportations send an entirely different message, one that understandably stirs painful memories of U.S. interventionism in Latin America and undermines Colombia’s sovereignty. Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, his state’s first Latino senator,posted during the Trump-Petro row: “Colombia has stopped millions of migrants from coming to the U.S. Trump’s strategy of antagonizing our allies is not smart policy—it just endangers decades of partnership with Colombia. We can’t act like this is some sort of 3D chess. This could’ve been handled with a simple phone call.” But a “simple phone call” wasn’t what Trump or his supporters wanted. They wanted toresurrect the Monroe Doctrineandmanifest destinywith flash, power and propaganda. They wanted to play the role of the tough, ugly American neighbor, vanquishing anyone perceived as weaker in the eyes of American imperialism and expansionism. First, there’s the threat to take the Panama Canal. Then, the Gulf of Mexico being renamed the Gulf of America in an executive order. Now, there’s the bullying of Colombia. And that’s Colombia, not Columbia,as the White House reportedly misspelledit in a press statement about the tariffs. Not spelling the country’s name correctly is another sign of disrespect. By Sunday night, the White House was gloating about Colombia’s total capitulation. The message is clear: If you don’t submit to the Trump way, he will make sure to leave the door open to exert whatever pressure he can. “We’ve got a strong president willing to demand action. If they don’t act, then there’ll be consequences,” border czar Tom Homantold NBC NewsSunday night. The swiftness with which the Trump administration claimed victory underscores the enduring imbalance of power between the United States and Latin America. Homan’s comments encapsulate the Trump administration’s strategy: force compliance through economic threats and public bluster, all while framing any resistance as a failure of the opposing government. Petro’s words resonated with those who see the region as more than a pawn in America’s power plays. Yet, the swiftness with which the Trump administration claimed victory underscores the enduring imbalance of power between the United States and Latin America. For all Petro’s fiery words, the reality remains: resistance is costly, and in this case, Petro determined that his country couldn’t pay that price.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows When I spoke with a mother about being separated from her 4-year-old daughter during the “zero tolerance” border policies of President Donald Trump’s first term, she told me “it was like having my heart ripped from my body.” Today, the reverberating impacts of the U.S. government’s forced family separations still tear across communities, countries and generations. Many believed that after the public outcry and reversal by Trump officials, this shameful chapter of American history would close. Make no mistake: Mass deportation equals mass family separation. Approximately 4.4 million children who are U.S. citizens have undocumented parents. Yet this won’t happen if the new president follows through on his threat of mass deportations of all undocumented immigrants. Trump and those he’s gathered around him have repeatedly stated they would deport all undocumented immigrants.Make no mistake: Mass deportation equals mass family separation. Approximately4.4 million childrenwho are U.S. citizens have undocumented parents. Of the estimated11 million undocumentedimmigrants in the U.S., a substantial number have minor children who are U.S. citizens and cannot legally be deported. To fulfill his campaign promises, Trump will need to either separate more than 4 million U.S.-citizen children from their parents — or illegally deport more than 4 million U.S.-citizen children to countries they’ve never known.Some 5,500 childrenwere separated from their parents during Trump’s first term. These separations devastated these families and plunged the Department of Homeland Security into crisis, as was detailed inthe new MSNBC documentary “Separated” by reporter Jacob Soboroff. Yet now, millions of U.S. children at are at risk, including undocumented children. I’m a pediatrician who has studiedthe harms of family separation. I know that either outcome would be a human rights, humanitarian and health catastrophe without precedent. When Kristen Welker, the host of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” recentlyasked Trump about his deportation plan’s effect on families, Trump presented two options. He said, “They can all go out together,” meaning children who are citizens would be deported, or deported parents could leave their children behind. He said “the family has a choice.” This “choice” forces families into an untenable position. Deporting families together ignores the reality that we’re talking about children who’ve built their entire lives here. Forcing them to leave the only country they’ve ever known would mean abandoning their education, communities and other family members in the States. For many, it would mean returning to a place their parents fled because of war, torture, persecution or other turmoil. I have witnessed firsthand the severe trauma — indeed the torture — that these separations inflict. In my two decades of pediatric medicine practice and extensive work documenting family separation cases with Physicians for Human Rights, I have witnessed firsthand the severe trauma —indeed the torture, as a seminal PHR report concluded— that these separations inflict. Through my clinical practice and research, I know that children who have undergone such adverse childhood experienceshave changes to their brainthat we can see on an MRI, physiological and metabolic changes to their body and lifelong psychological effects, including severe depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Asone father I interviewedasked me: Who can return the formative years of these children’s lives back to their families? Who can go back in time and be the parents who lovingly taught them to tie their shoelaces or ride their bikes? Who can repair those broken bonds? No one can. The immense damagethat family separation causes to children and parents is clear. In addition to the psychological harms, affected families could seea nearly 50% reduction in household income, the Center for Migration Studies has reported. This increases the chances of food insecurity and often leads to chronic stress, which can negatively impact health and development. Researchers are also sounding the alarm on how deporting millions of immigrant families would hobble the agricultural, construction, food service and many other industries, resulting in higher prices for everyone. What message does it send when we force millions of American-citizen children to choose between their families and their birthright citizenship? These are not theoretical questions; they are decisions that will devastate families who have built their lives in the U.S. The proposed mass deportations will lead only to mass separation, mass trauma and mass chaos on a scale far beyond what we witnessed during Trump’s first term. Who looks at the crisis of family separation in Trump’s first term — when some 5,500 children were separated — and believes we should scale it up 800 times? We are at a moment that will define not just our immigration policy, but our national character. We are at a moment that will define not just our immigration policy, but our national character. While the challenges of immigration reform are complex, so-called solutions that traumatize children, fragment families and force American citizens to choose between their own homeland or deportation with their parents violate both our values and our medical understanding of human development. Regardless of political affiliation, we must pursue immigration policies that maintain family unity, protect children’s well-being, and recognize the deep roots many immigrant families have established in our communities. The alternative — implementing mass deportations that would separate millions of families — would inflict generational trauma that no future policy or administration could repair.

The president and his followers have falsely portrayed diversity, equity and inclusion programs as illegal and discriminatory against straight white men, in particular. And hegave his bigoted threats some teeththis week when he ordered his attorney general to compile a report with “recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.” Multiple companies — includingMcDonald’sandWalmart— already had acquiesced and shut down their diversity initiatives, andTargetjoined the list Friday. But it appears some other large companies are — at least for now — pushing back against this right-wing crusade and refusing to abandon their official commitments to diversity in the workplace. Multiple companies — including McDonald’s and Walmart — already had acquiesced and shut down their diversity initiatives, and Target joined the list Friday. Costco is receiving some online praise, for example, aftermore than 98% of shareholders recently rejecteda shareholder proposal for a report on any risks posed by the company’s DEI policies. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon have faced similar activist proposals at their companies, but speaking at this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,both said they remain committedto seeking out diverse talent despite the right-wing crusade. Asked in a CNBC interview about the anti-DEI push among investors, Dimon said: “Bring them on.” A number of other CEOs at Davos, including Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, Vista Equity Partners CEO Robert Smith and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins,all vowed that their companies will remain committedto prioritizing diversity even as they navigate the new legal terrain under Trump. And good on them for that. Let’s hope they follow through, because doing so makes good business sense. DEI programs help foster work environments that studies have shown aremore productive than ones where diversity isn’t emphasized. So it’s fair to say the businesses that bend to the MAGA movement on this issue are spiting themselves. And the companies that don’t are equipping themselves to truly compete and excel in a world that is only getting more diverse. Ja’han Jones is The ReidOut Blog writer.

Colombian officials said their country would accept planes of migrants who tried to enter the United States illegally, but they objected to military jets landing on Colombian soil. With this in mind, Colombia did, in fact, turn away deportation flights, prompting a rather hysterical response from Donald Trump, who announced “emergency” tariffs and a diplomatic response that the Republican presidentdescribed as“a Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations on the Colombian Government Officials, and all Allies and Supporters.” But just as Americans started facing the prospect ofmore expensive coffee and cut flowers, among other products, the two countries came to an apparent agreement.NBC News reported: The White House said Sunday that Colombia has agreed to all of President Donald Trump’s terms after Trump threatened to impose sweeping retaliatory measures against it, including tariffs and visa sanctions, after it denied entry to two U.S. military deportation flights.  Of course, the fact that the U.S. administration appears to be getting the outcome it wanted makes it far more likely that Trump will use similar tactics with other countries going forward. But stepping back, it’s hard not to notice that this was hardly the only international incident the Republican created in the first week of his second term. Trump’s comments about wanting to “clean out“ Gaza and relocate Palestinians to other countrieshave reportedly“astonished moderate Arab leaders who had been looking forward to working with him.” His commentsblaming Ukraine for Russia’s invasionwill likely do little to end the war. Trump’s ambitions about acquiring Greenland have led him to make increasingly provocative comments directed at officials in Denmark — a NATO ally. “I think we’re going to have it,”the president said over the weekend, referring to taking control of Greenland. He added, “I don’t know really what claim Denmark has to it. But it would be a very unfriendly act if they didn’t allow that to happen.” The Trump administration’sforeign-aid freezeisaffecting international programs“aimed at alleviating hunger, disease and wartime suffering around the globe, as well as ones that help nations with economic development.” Panamasubmitted a formal letter to the United Nationslast week, rejecting the Republican’s comments about reclaiming the Panama Canal. The German ambassador to the United States last week reportedlywrote a diplomatic reportwarning that Trump’s return to power will pose new threats to American democracy and our constitutional system. And in case that weren’t quite enough, Trump also had some comments last week about the international BRICS coalition, which heoccasionally pretends to understand. “They’re a BRICS nation, Spain,”the president told reporters. “You know what a BRICS nation is? You’ll figure it out.” Spain is not, in reality, a part of BRICS — and Spanish officialsdid noticeTrump’s screw-up. At this pace, the new American president should be able to alienate just about every other country on the planet by, say, mid-summer.

These moves are not simply about abstract opposition to government; fully explaining them requires acknowledging U.S. history. Fromthe militarytothe United States Postal Serviceto sundry federal agencies, the federal government’s personnel policies — though nowhere near perfect — havehelped expand and sustain a Black middle class. The federal government’s personnel policies — though nowhere near perfect — have helped expand and sustain a Black middle class. The most well-known example of this shows up at your home every day: the U.S. Postal Service. The Post Office Department, as it used to be called, was oncethe single largest employer of Black peoplein the United States. In 2022, according to the Government Accountability Office, “about 53 percent of [the Postal Service’s] total workforceconsisted of individuals from historically disadvantaged racial or ethnic groups, and women made up about 46 percent of the workforce.” And it’s not just the post office. As the Center for American Progress pointed outin a 2020 report, “the federal government has hired Black Americans at higher rates than the private sector going back a century or more.” Not coincidentally, generations of conservatives — fromGeorge Wallaceto Donald Trump — have plotted torein in the federal government. Let’s be clear, then, why the federal government has bothered conservatives so much and for so long. And let’s be clear about the impacts reducing the federal workforce — either via the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” or by unleashinganti-DEI“patter rollers” — would have. Trump tying the hands of federal workers,essentially criminalizing the work they’ve been doing, or planning to lay them off will have disastrous consequences for Americans throughout the country. Millions outside the government will soon learn in the worst ways how much they’ve relied on the work federal employees do every day. But the devastation for the workers themselves cannot be forgotten. And we can expect extra hardship for Black communities. The federal workforce, though far from majority Black,is disproportionately Black. Thus, any policy aimed at firing federal workers en masse — even if it is not explicitly tied to Trump’s despicable anti-DEI obsession — would still disproportionately hurt Black people. This is not a bug in Trump’s program. It is a feature. This is not a bug in Trump’s program. It is a feature. Explaining why Black people have been drawn to federal jobs, Marcus Board, a Howard University political science professor, told Washington’s NBC affiliate, “They have worker protections, federal worker protections, that are guaranteed by the federal government, and soit’s one of the few placeswhere they can be sure that they’re going to be supported, protected and taken care of.” When a reporter said many people in and around Washington interpret attacks on the federal government as an attack on Black Americans, specifically the Black middle class, Board said, “I think that’s an accurate read.” Indeed. There’s no greater predictor ofa white backlashthanBlack success. But conservative animosity isn’t solely about who federal workers are; it’s also about the changes the federal government has forced conservative parts of the country to adopt. After the Civil War, the federal government imposed Reconstruction and — however briefly — protected newly freed Black people from the planter class that sought to essentially re-enslave them. Federal marshals held Ruby Bridges’ hand as she walked through a gantlet of angry white people to William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans and sent troops to escortthe Little Rock Nineinto that city’s Central High School. Federal officials and judges stopped numerous racist schemes that jurisdictions, particularly in the South, employed to suppress the Black vote. To accuse the federal government of overreach, then, is to oppose the progress the feds have helped usher in. To accuse the federal government of overreach is to oppose the progress the feds have helped usher in. In 1980, then-presidential candidateRonald Reagan told an audience at Mississippi’s Neshoba County Fair, “I believe that there are programs like that, programs like education and others, that should be turned back to the states and the local communities with the tax sources to fund them, and let the people—.” According to the newspaper that reported his speech, the applause drowned out the rest of Reagan’s sentence. “Programs like education,” Reagan said — in a state wherewhat minimal integrationthere was had only existed forabout 10 years. “I believe in states’ rights,” he said. The conservative project of getting rid of the Department of Educationwasn’t yet a year oldwhen Reagan gave that stump speech. The time of its founding is directly related to the department’s role in the enforcement of civil rights — and the broader animosity on the right at the very idea of public education afterthe Supreme Court prohibited racial segregation in public schools. Trumppromised during the 2024 campaign to get rid of the department altogether. It’s a goal of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 (whichTrump swore he had nothing to do with). The Heritage Foundation itself was co-founded by a conservative activist upset that the federal government told Bob Jones University it couldn’t maintain its nonprofit status andrefuse admission to Black students. The religious right would soon make fighting abortion its main cause,the evangelical writer and activist Lisa Sharon Harper has argued, but its raison d’être was defending segregation. It’s impossible to separate conservative animosity toward the federal government from conservatives’ history of opposing integration and Black progress. And Trump attacking the federal workforce as he rolls backcivil rights edictsand DEI initiatives means we don’t have to pretend they're unrelated.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows PresidentDonald Trumptook the unusual step Friday offiring 18 of the federal government’s 73 inspectors general. Those let go — from the departments of Defense, State, Labor, Health and Human Services, among other places — were told only that “changing priorities” led to their dismissal. Inspectors general, as they are called,are found all over Washington, D.C.,in a wide range of agencies and departments. They seldom make news, but they play an important role in blowing the whistle on instances of gross inefficiencies or unlawful behavior and by not being the servants of any political party. In short, as Creighton University law professorMichael Kelly writes,the inspector general is a “modern adaptation to achieving the checks and balances the Framers of our Constitution intended when they created the federal government.” So why would Trump go after them at the start of his second term? This is not the first time Trump has targeted inspectors general. Doing so, Kelly explains, “lays the groundwork for taking over that government from within.” As he puts it, “if the designated watchers aren’t watching, because they’ve been purged by the very abuse of power they were installed to prevent, then the way is open for more abuse and corruption to flow.” The mass firing also sends a clear message not just to remaining inspectors general, including those at the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, but also to the rest of the federal bureaucracy: Get with the program or you will be next. Downplaying the significance of the dismissals, thepresident told reportersthat firing IGs is “a very common thing to do.” “I don’t know them,” he told reporters, “But some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing their job. It’s a very standard thing to do.’” It’s true that this is not the first time Trump has targeted inspectors general. Late in his first term, hedismissedthe inspectors general of five Cabinet departments. But unlike this time, those firings took place over a six-week period. And mass firings are exceptionally rare. Upon taking office in 1981, Ronald Reagan removed all 15 inspectors general then serving, only to rehire about half of them later. Since then,no president has removed more than two IGs— except for Trump. Congresscreated the first inspector general position in 1976, in an era of post-Watergate reform. Two years later, it passed the Inspector General Act of 1978. That law said that inspectors general should lead “independent and objective units,” which would, among other things,  “conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations” of the departments and agencies in which they serve. And Congress made clear that these new officers did not just report to the executive branch. The law also required them to keep agency heads and Congress “fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies relating to the administration of… programs and operations and the necessity for and progress of corrective action.” Thirty years later, Congressamended the regulations around the IG role, requiring that a president “shall communicate in writing the reasons for any such removal or transfer [of an inspector general] to both Houses of Congress, not later than 30 days before the removal or transfer.” The constitutional precedents here are similarly clear-cut. As a 2021 Congressional Research Reportnotes, “the legislative history of the 2008 amendment suggests that the purpose of this change was to ‘allow for an appropriate dialogue with Congress in the event that the planned transfer or removal is viewed as an inappropriate or politically motivated attempt to terminate an effective Inspector General.’” In 2022, following Trump’s first term purge of IGs, Congressstrengthenedthat requirement by saying that the president had to provide a “substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons” before terminating an IG. The constitutional precedents here are similarly clear-cut. The Supreme Courthas long recognizedCongress’ exclusive authority “to create executive branch offices….and when necessary, design an office in a way that encourages operational independence from the political influence of the executive branch….” It alsohas made clearthat the president’s removal power is not “illimitable.” But neither clear statutes nor congressional authority or constitutional limits on the removal power seemed to matter to Trump or his allies. The president “has a right to get in there who he wants,” Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton argued — a more deferential approach thanhe has taken to Democratic presidents. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, who co-sponsored the 2008 amendment, nevertheless shrank from confronting Trump. “There may be good reason the IG were fired,” heinsisted. And according to The Associated Press, Sen. Lindsey Graham even admitted that Trump had not followed statutes. “Just tell them you need to follow the law next time,” Graham said. Such a casual attitude toward a president who ignores the law doesn’t augur well for what is to come. A letter to the president from House Democratswas anything but casual. “Your actions,” it said, “violate the law, attack our democracy, and undermine the safety of the American people….Firing inspectors general without due cause is antithetical to good government, undermines the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and degrades the federal government’s ability to function effectively and efficiently.” They were right. But maybe those reasons were precisely why Trump did what he did Friday night. Austin Sarat is the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Science at Amherst College.

The meeting was abruptly canceled Wednesday in a terse email from an NIH staff member; I soon heard from colleagues that all such committees, and other related meetings in the grant process that were scheduled for the remainder of January,were being canceled. Becausethere was no official statement about these cancellations, their intent, extent and duration are unclear. It is presumed to be part of the shutdown of various activitiesacross scientific agencies, includinghiring, travel and scientific communications at the NIH. Regardless of the reason, this is a potentially devastating event — not just for the scientific community, but for all Americans. To understand why, it’s important to explain a bit of the research funding and review cycle. To review grants for scientific merit, grant agencies bring together committees, or “study sections,” of around 25 to 30 people from different fields, with topical and methodological expertise of various kinds. These study sections are followed by advisory council meetings that ensure proposals are scientifically sound and align with the NIH’s priorities. The council meetings have apparently beencanceled as well, affecting proposals that had already cleared study sections’ review within the past few months. If this pause is not reversed soon, the fallout for scientific research in the U.S. may be felt for years to come. Without scientific review, a cycle of applications cannot move forward to the council meetings, and without councils’ recommendations, a cycle of proposals with high merit cannot move forward for funding at this time. If this pause is not reversed soon, the fallout for scientific research in the U.S. may be felt for years to come. Let’s say a researcher trains for many years to conduct a line of scientific inquiry, acquiring knowledge about the disease and about cutting-edge research methodologies, and then manages to secure a job at a university to do that research as faculty. In general, that job by itself will not provide sustained funds to pursue that research full time, no matter how necessary or lifesaving or successful the work is. For the most part, researchers must secure funds for their research through a competitive grant process. And the backbone of funding is from federal agencies. Research grants do not just pay for the material and technical resources to conduct the research project. They cover the salary and benefits of the researcher and the staff, which includes research coordinators, lab technicians, data analysts, biostatisticians and others, representing alarge, economy-boosting workforce across the country. They also “keep the lights on,” providing support for universities and other organizations that provide the infrastructure for the research and other, nonresearch activities. And they support trainees who work under an established researcher, generating the future research workforce. Because any given grant only supports a small portion of a researcher’s time for a few years, most must continuously pursue funding so that they and their teams can receive a full paycheck that doesn’t abruptly disappear when a grant ends. So by and large, scientists are not only doing the science, but serving as their own fundraisers, supporting the institution that has hired them, and helping fund the trainees whom they teach. The work of filing grant proposals is nearly invisible to the public, but represents a staggering amount of work and a skill set unto itself. A single grant proposal may take years to conceptualize; the preliminary studies leading up to a major grant proposal may be the result of decades of work. A fully assembled application is at least over 100 pages, including an explanation of its significance and novelty, its methods, the team assembled to perform the project, the research budget, the ethical conduct of research, and more. More complex, multicenter grants can be north of 400 pages. And researchers are in a continuous process of reworking prior grants that did not get funded and generating new grant submissions. Once submitted, the proposals typically go through a standardized review process that filters each application through the eyes of multiple experts to identify proposals that have high potential to have significant impact on our health. The process is a year-round, complexadministrative undertaking: At the NIH alone, it engages tens of thousands of reviewers annually in more than 1,000 meetings with study sections like the one I should have been sitting in Thursday. I’ve never heard of mass cancellations like those that occurred this week. In a standard process at the NIH (where most of my grants have been submitted and review work has been), a given session may be assigned as many as 100 grants or more. Each reviewer may be assigned eight to 10 grants and spend upward of 50 hours reading applications and submitting their critique prior to the meeting. Because so many reviewers have research-related positions that keep them very busy outside these sections, and some meetings require travel and lodging arrangements, scheduling these sections occurs well in advance. And for just a single study section, federal staff prep for months to ensure submitted grants are complete, assign them to review committees with the appropriate focus and expertise, and contend with myriad logistical issues. I’ve never heard of mass cancellations like those that occurred this week, so I don’t have a good mental model for what happens next, but rescheduling and restarting the whole process described above will be challenging, to say the least, particularly in the context of any hiring freezes or personnel reductions. The cost of delays is hard to overstate. Mary-Claire King, an award-winning cancer researcher,once shared a storyabout how she almost didn’t make it to the NIH to secure an initial grant for what eventually became a lifesaving therapy for breast cancer. While parts of her story are extraordinary (like a run-in with baseball legend Joe DiMaggio), it underscores the fact that careers in research can be incredibly fragile. One well-timed grant can seed a line of sustained inquiry that leads to something meaningful for the health and longevity of Americans; a missed grant can delay or derail that work. A single grant can ensure that whole research teams that have taken years to build can stay together and sustain their work. For those early in their careers, even a small, short-term grant at the right moment can serve as a critical fork in the road to a research-track career. Why do these changes in trajectory, even a single skipped research cycle, matter? There are lives on the other end. Practices in medicine unimaginable a generation ago are now routine because the research machine marches on, cycle after cycle. The colleagues I’ve heard from this week have dedicated themselves to improving and saving lives. Studying novel cancer therapies. Improving the management of childhood asthma. Understanding factors that make diabetes difficult to manage. Slowing the course of Alzheimer’s. Across my research communities, the overwhelming sentiment is concern about the impact on bodies of science, current and future, on being able to help people and sustain ongoing improvements in quality of life and lifespan. “My research helps a lot of people,” a research colleague, who is a cancer geneticist at a top-10 research institution, wrote to me Wednesday. “However, I am not yet tenured faculty, meaning that I won’t get to keep my job as a physician scientist in a couple of years if I don’t get an NIH grant. Period. It is terrifying, devastating, to think it could all just disintegrate so quickly.” For people everywhere living with a disease that does not yet have an effective therapy, it’s likely that somewhere in this cycle of deferred research, there is someone who cares about that disease, knows that you cannot wait for the solutions, and has been working night and day to chip away at the answers for you. If this week’s shutdown is any indication of our government’s approach to science, those answers may remain lost for longer than they should.

On Friday, the justicessaid that they would consider a bidfor the country’s first publicly funded religious charter school, in Oklahoma. A week earlier, the court hadsaid that it would hear an appealfrom Maryland parents seeking the right to keep their children from reading LGBTQ-themed books. In both cases, religious groups successfully petitioned the justices despite warnings that crediting their legal claims would break new ground. To be sure, the court has already favored First Amendment religious argumentsin recent years. Doing so in these new cases wouldn’t be a new phenomenon. The question is how much further the court might go in this area. To be sure, the court has already favored First Amendment religious arguments in recent years. In the Oklahoma case,the petitionfrom lawyers with theAlliance Defending Freedomcited recent high court rulings bolstering First Amendment claims of free exercise of religion. Opposing their petition, the state’s Republican attorney general distinguished those rulings bywriting thatthey were about “state subsidization of tuition at existing private religious schools, not state establishment of new public religious schools.” Responding to the Supreme Court’s taking of the Oklahoma case, the American Civil Liberties Union and otherssaid in a statement: “Converting public schools into Sunday schools would be a dangerous sea change for our democracy.” Notably, JusticeAmy Coney Barrettrecused herself from the case. Theordergranting reviewdidn’t explainwhy the court will be without the Trump appointee, who has beenin the majorityin divided religion rulings. But if the case is headed for another partisan split on the court with six Republican appointees and three Democratic appointees, the rest of the majority may have figured it can afford to lose one vote. It takes four justices to grant review. The court has a full set of justices for the Maryland case, Mahmoud v. Taylor. Citing similar First Amendment precedents, parents of elementary school studentssay their rights are burdenedthrough their children’s forced participation in certain instruction on gender and sexuality without parental notice or the chance to opt out. School officials, meanwhile,say that the parentsare trying to “unsettle a decades-old consensus that parents who choose to send their children to public school are not deprived of their right to freely exercise their religion simply because their children are exposed to curricular materials the parents find offensive.” Of course,the Dobbs caseand other recent appeals have shown that a majority of the court can change how the law is interpreted if it chooses to.

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows It has been one week sincePresident Donald Trumpwas sworn in for the second time. The past seven days have been, at best, disorienting, as the new administration has jackknifed the country to the right so fast that the centrifugal force already feels crushing. In that time, Trump acted on his promise to unleasha wave of executive actionsto begin transforming the federal government in his image. After Trump’s win over then-Vice President Kamala Harris, many of the people I know felt numb or checked out, unable to contemplate what was coming. I told anyone who would listen that that feeling would change once the theoretical became practical and all the hypotheticals under discussion emerged into our new daily realty. A great wave of Americans have now checked back in at once — and the net effect is straining our collective mental capacity. Beyond the policy shifts, though, the overall feeling of Trump’s ascension is different this time. So far, Trump haspardoned or commuted the sentencesof nearly every Jan. 6 rioter, including those who assaulted the Capitol Police. He has launched the first salvo in his quest toend birthright citizenshipas guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. He has rushed tocut off immigration optionsfor people who have been — as Republicans so often put it — waiting in line for their turn, and he has moved toenact mass deportations of those already here legally. His administration hasthreatened federal workers who work to improve diversity, issued a freeze onthe Justice Department’s civil rights investigations, paused wide swaths ofcritical health researchand commanded state and local officials tocooperate with his anti-immigrant sweeps or face prosecution. Beyond the policy shifts, though, the overallfeelingof Trump’s ascension is different this time. When he won in 2016, it was a surprise for virtually the entire country,the newly elected president included. Eight years ago, the narrow Electoral College win by this garish figure was seen as a likely fluke; the country’s economic anxiety had prompted a regretful mistake in selecting Trump (and let’s not forget, there was clear evidence of foreign interference). With the proverbial adrenaline pumping on the left, the backlash from the millions who hadn’t voted for him was immediate. The stumbles in his administration’s early days made his time as a national force feel like a frightening, but ultimately temporary, stumbling block in the nation’s progress. This time it wasimpossible not to see what was comingin the event of a Trump win. The investigations and court cases surrounding his final days in office had laid bare his willingness to discard the Constitution in favor of retaining power. The Heritage Foundation’sProject 2025was there for anyone to read, no matter how many denials and disavowals the campaign issued. After years of seeing Trump in office and out, even asthe haze of nostalgiasettled over Americans’ collective memory, there was no pretense about his being “a changed man.” If anything, Trumpleaned into being himself, to the delight of his supporters. If his first win felt like being sucker punched rounding a corner, the second feels like havingseen the threat comingfrom a mile away and been powerless to avoid it. As a result, the country has shifted to accommodate his depredations this time around. “Trump’s cultural victory has lapped his political victory,”The New York Times’ Ezra Klein wrote recently, noting how the narrowness of the president’s victory over Harris doesn’t correlate to the deeper resentments it ostensibly tapped. “The election was close, but the vibes have been a rout. ... In 2016, Trump felt like an emissary of the past; in 2025, he’s being greeted as a harbinger of the future.” That’s correct, but the “future” on offer is one of maximum regression to a darker past. It is incumbent on his opponents not to let the present cacophony overwhelm their sense of purpose or focus. The depth of the shift hit hardest for me in a quote from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt aboutTrump’s executive order on gender, which will affect trans and nonbinary Americans’ passports. “They can still apply to renew their passport — they just have to use their God-given sex, which was decided at birth,” Leavitt toldNOTUS’ Oriana González. It was Leavitt’s use of “God-given sex” that threw me. Here was the chief spokesperson for the White House padding officially sanctioned bigotry with a religious justification. More concerning was the callousness with which she tossed it off, confident that it wouldn’t drive headlines or prompt any consequences for her. This last week’sflurry of actionhas been an extended flex of the MAGA movement’s newfound sense of dominance. Several people havecompared the blitzkrieg underwayto the “shock and awe” campaign launched against Iraq at the onset of the U.S. invasion in 2003. (We’re unfortunately seeing today’s elected Democrats showing a similar instinct to follow the tide, fearing further electoral losses instead of standing up for what is right.) What begins now, though, is the administration’s long, hard slog to make these changes stick as part of its campaign of domestic nation-building. MAGA can only succeed by convincing enough of the populace that the changes Trump is making are inevitable and everlasting. Thefirst 100 days of an administrationare about notching easy wins and deciding which tougher pushes to spend political capital on. But Trump is,as ever,burning through a pile of creditthat far exceeds the collateral behind it. It’s a gambit that requires convincing anyone with the ability to push back on him that it won’t be worth checking his balance sheets. The sheer scope at which he is trying to act at once is a strategy designed for a sprint, not a marathon, in hopes of accomplishing as much as possible before anyone catches on that he’s spending beyond his political means. It is incumbent on his opponents not to let the present cacophony overwhelm their sense of purpose or focus. It may take longer to overcome the inertia many are feeling with the crashing down of that wave we all saw coming, to marshal enough resistance to reach critical mass. In the meantime, there arelegal challenges being filedto counter Trump’s unlawfulness andmutual aid is being organizedin communities across America. The fate of our country will not be decided in the span of a week. The biggest threat is mistaking the scale of this opening salvo for anything more than the opening of a much longer struggle.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows With the stroke of a pen late Monday, freshly inauguratedPresident Donald Trumptook trans rights back more than a decade bysigning an executive orderthat, in essence, commands federal government agencies to stop recognizing the existence oftrans people. Theexecutive order, titled “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” orders government officials to treat sex as “biological” and “determined at conception.” It specifically says imprisoned trans women are to be held in men’s prisons and that federal single-gender spaces are to be used according to so-called “biological sex.” And perhaps most importantly to working class trans people in the U.S., Trump ordered the State Department to ban the practice of assigning X as a gender marker on U.S. passports and barred gender marker changes going forward on passports and all federal identification. The message feels unimaginably cruel: Trump and his supporters want me and my fellow trans community to detransition, to retreat back in the closet out of fear. On Tuesday, the White House clarified that the passport rules do not apply to previously issued passports, but, if a trans person seeks to renew their passport, they would have to return to the gender marker of their birth.NBC News reporteda warning from experts for trans people and those with an X (usually used by nonbinary people who don’t want to be identified as either male or female) on their passport, saying that such international travelers could potentially be detained until a new passport with their assigned sex at birth can be re-issued. If true, that process could take weeks and presumably trans women in this situation would be detained with men and trans men with women, given other references in the order. It is the most widespread government intrusion into the private lives of trans people since gay sex was legalized in 2003 in theLawrence v. Texas Supreme Court decision. While most trans people rightfully panicked over the new passport rules, it’s important to tell the whole story of the executive order, which extends further than travel documentation. Housing trans prisoners with menresults in horrific rates of prison rape. There’splenty of studyandevidenceof this. The reason that trans women started being housed with other women is because courts determined that it was cruel and unusual punishment to subject a specific minority torampant prison rape. That risk now extends to trans travelers who might be detained trying to re-enter the country. The order also opens federal employees who are trans to widespread discrimination. Trump is sending an early signal that trans people have no place in  the America he is trying to build over the next four years. It is not the government of reasonable people with a handful of concerns that the trans rights movement maybe went a little too far. It’s arguably genocidal, according to the official definition of genocide. This is not about trans athletes, this is not about transition care for minors, we’re looking at a future where trans Americans are detained by their own government just trying to come home from overseas. Are you not outraged by this? I woke up this week as officially a second-class citizen, simply because I exist in a way that the party in power does not believe should be allowed. The message feels unimaginably cruel: Trump and his supporters want me and my fellow trans community to detransition, to retreat back in the closet out of fear. This executive order has made my practical life even more difficult in ways that I anticipate I’ll keep discovering in the coming years. But, Mr. President, I am not going back and I am not afraid.

Chicago Public Schools initially put out a public statement that identifiedtwo federal agents who went to Hamline Elementary School as officers from ICE, which earlier this week wasgiven the green lightto make arrests at schools, places of worships, hospitals and other “sensitive” locations in a reversal of a long-standing policy. The agents, however, were Secret Service personnel “investigating a threat to one of our protectees in reference to the recent TikTok ban,” the agency said in a statement. The agents identified themselves to the school principal and left without incident, the agency said, adding that it does not “investigate nor enforce immigration laws.” The agents were not granted entry to the school. CPS said its officials “followed the established protocols to ensure student safety” and contacted Chicago Public Schools’ Law Department and Office of Safety and Security. “While this was a misunderstanding in terms of the specific branch of DHS, the school’s response demonstrates that our system, in partnership with community organizations, is prepared and ready to keep our students and staff safe,” the school district said. In apost on X, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson cautioned against sharing unverified rumors, writing, “While people across the city are worried about heightened immigration enforcement, it is imperative that individuals not spread unverified information that sparks fear.” The incident is reflective of theclimate of fearpermeating communities acrossthe country as Trump readies federal authorities to carry out hisplans for mass deportations. Since Trump took office, ICE has begun announcing on social media the number of daily arrests it says it has carried out. The agency has also conducted immigration raids in several cities that havereportedly ensnared U.S. citizensas well. More than 90% of students at Hamline Elementary are Hispanic,according to public school data.The Washington Postinterviewed a 10-year-old girl who recalled hiding in a classroom as the principal ordered a lockdown over the loudspeakers during the incident. “Everyone was so scared,” the 10-year-old, who was granted anonymity to protect her safety, told the Post, “because we didn’t know if it was a shooter or the immigration police.” Clarissa-Jan Lim is a breaking/trending news blogger for MSNBC Digital.

Biggs, aJan. 6 proponentand member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, made the announcement at an Arizona Republican Party event,telling the crowd: “I am jumping in formally. It is now time to Make Arizona Great Again.” Biggs, whohelped Trumpin his attempt to overturn the 2020 election,toldthe conservative outletNewsmaxin an interview on Sunday that Arizona should be “the reddest state in the country.” His election would certainly be a step toward claiming that title. Biggs is alleged to have beena key playerin the deliberations among MAGA activists, Trump administration officials and far-right lawmakers who devised schemes for overturning Trump’s 2020 election. After the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, for example, far-right activist Ali Alexander — who organized the “stop the steal” rally that preceded the riot —has said Biggs was one of the lawmakers who helped himcook up that day’s plan to exert “maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting” to certify Joe Biden’s election victory, though Biggs hasn’t been accused of coordinating or promoting the violent attack on the Capitol. (Biggs has denied helping Alexander organize the Jan. 6 rally.) Video here: Alexander latertestified to the House Jan. 6 committeethat he’d been in contact with Biggs and other lawmakers in the lead-up to Jan. 6, 2021, which Biggs had denied. And former White House staffer Cassidy Hutchinsontold the committeeBiggs was one of multiple lawmakers who sought a pardon from Trump, whichBiggs has also denied. It’s worth noting, however, that Alexander and Hutchinson made their claims under oath, which Biggs does not appear to have done. Herefused to comply with a House subpoenato testify as part of thefederalJan. 6 investigation, but has beensubpoenaed by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes to testifyin her ongoing, state-level Jan. 6 probe. There’s no indication Mayes is pursuing criminal charges against Biggs, and it’s unclear whether he has testified. The representative celebrated Trump’s blanket pardon for Jan. 6 criminals, evengreeting some of the recently released inmatesand their supporters at a Washington, D.C., jail last week. Biggs is the only Republican to declare his candidacy in the governor’s race thus far. Barring a successful primary challenge, he is likely to face Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs next year.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows ByJordan Rubin How far does Donald Trump’sblanket clemencyforJan. 6 defendantsgo? The seemingly philosophical question has immediate legal consequences, raised not only by the sheer number of people pardoned but also by the diversity of some of their criminal conduct extending beyond the confines of the Capitol that day. Take the case of Dan Edwin Wilson. The Jan. 6 defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer, as well as to firearm-related charges resulting from a search of his Kentucky home. He was sentenced by a Trump-appointed judge, Dabney Friedrich, to five years in prison on both sets of charges to run concurrently (meaning running together, not consecutively). The Justice Department hadrecommended a five-year term. Then came Trump’s clemency order last week, whichgranted pardonsfor people “convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” Wilson was then released from the federal Bureau of Prisons. But according to a court filing from his lawyer on Sunday, the BOP wants him back. “Whether he was, in fact, pardoned of both sets of offenses has yet to be litigated,” his lawyer Norman Pattiswrote in seeking a court orderhalting any incarceration effort while the issue is litigated. The lawyer also wrote: “Although the firearms charges arose from evidence seized in a search of Mr. Wilson’s home, that search warrant was issued to seek evidence of his participation in the Capitol riot. It pre-dated his arrest on riot-related charges.” The question this raises is whether the firearm charges are “related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” Getting back to the text of Trump’s order, the question this raises is whether the firearm charges are “related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” How the courts answer the question depends on how broadly they see the events as being “related.” As his lawyer frames the matter, the firearm charges are related in the sense that they stemmed from a search for Jan. 6-related evidence. Yet, how far does the “related” connection extend? One can think of examples that push the notion beyond the breaking point. To take an extreme hypothetical, what if law enforcement had found a dead body in Wilson’s home while searching for Jan. 6-related evidence? Would a pardon cover any federal charges he might face related to the body in that hypothetical scenario? Now, in typical litigation, an argument that one side raises would face adversarial testing by an opposing party. But here, the federal government under Trump is broadly on the defendants’ side. And if the courts push back against the defense argument and Trump doesn’t like that, then he’s free to issue a separate pardon to cover any firearm-related charges. In fact, if the president wants to ensure that none of his supporters face any further legal consequences (at least at the federal level, where he has clemency power), then he could issue another blanket pardon for any federal crimes whatsoever over a specific period of time, on top of the blanket Jan. 6 clemency. He could keep pardoning them until he leaves office for any and all federal crimes he chooses. So it’s unclear at the moment to what extent these novel questions will be answered in court. On Monday, Judge Friedrich ordered the government to respond by Tuesday. So first we’ll see if the new DOJ believes the conduct is covered by the pardon — and what the judge does in response.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows We’ve been having the wrong conversation about aging in America. Let me be clear. It’s not that we’ve completely avoided the topic. During an election that pitted two ofthe oldest presidential candidates in American historyagainst each other, and especially afterPresident Joe Biden’s calamitous debate performance, we spent a lot of time jawing about the age and capabilities of our political leaders. But that focus on the candidates’ elder status distracts us from a seismic issue that should really merit our attention: the historic surge in Americans who will be turning 65 over the next five years. Over the past decade, a steady cadence of10,000 people a day were turning 65. By the end of 2025, close to 12,000 people a day will turn 65 for the next two years. In 2024, that daily number jumped tomore than 11,200.By the end of 2025, close to 12,000 people a day will turn 65 for the next two years,according to the U.S. census, as the U.S. enters what demographers call the “Peak 65 period,” when all those baby boomers march into their senior years. The U.S. population is older at this moment than it has ever been,according to the Population Reference Bureau, and the number of Americans age 65 or older will increase by a whopping 47% by 2050. At that point, the tally of 82 million older adults will represent 23% of the U.S. population,according to the PRB. We are looking at what is reportedly the largest leap in retirement eligibility that America has ever seen, and it is happening at a moment when the gaps in our retirement system are impossible to ignore. Because all those silver-haired boomers don’t have the pensions or the savings that previous generations could count on, the massive cohort of aging Americans represents a tidal wave that will rock almost every aspect of our economy. AARP calls this demographic trend the “Silver Tsunami.” Other financial forecasters have used a different metaphor, likening the trend to a massive iceberg that the ship of state can’t maneuver around. One in five Americans over age 50 have no retirement savings according to AARP, and 61% are worried they won’t have enough socked away to live on in their senior years.For 1 in every 3 Americans,credit card debt outpaces their emergency savings, and more than 1 in 4 people have no emergency savings at all. And those savings may have to stretch over more years because the average life expectancy is increasing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vital statistics surveillance report projects thata man turning 65 this year is expected to live to age 84on average while an average 65-year-old woman is expected to live to 86. Because Americans are living longer, many of those boomers will remain in the workforce longer, but forecasters worry that those extra years on the job won’t translate into extra retirement savings. I am going to keep an eye on this demographic trend and return to this issue in coming months because it will touch almost every aspect of our economy and American life in general. As I talk with local government officials about the so-called Silver Tsunami, it becomes clear that cities and counties are quietly bracing themselves for an epidemic ofevictions,povertyand evenhomelessnessamong the elderly, many of whom are divorced, single or living far away from relatives or a reliable support system because families now tend to be more spread out geographically. Some states are taking a proactive approach. California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Texas and Colorado all have multisector master plans on aging that help the state and its residents prepare for housing, health, caregiving and affordability. Nine other states are developing such master plans. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pledged that cuts to Medicare and Social Securitywill not be includedin the legislative package intended to fund Trump’s agenda. With a slim majority, Johnson knows those cuts would be a nonstarter because no Democrat would be on board with slashing those programs. But even a status quo approach to elder retirement programs may not be enough to stave off disaster with such a large number of seniors with staggering needs. And in his first days in office,Trump has already signed executive ordersthat reverse Biden-era executive orders on health care, including the effort to limit the cost of prescription drugs for those on Medicaid or Medicare. For a president who is so focused on projecting strength and virility, will Trump lead the discussion this nation needs to have on the Silver Tsunami? Perhaps, but probably not. It is indeed a blessing for anyone fortunate to live well beyond six decades and also a blessing for the people in their orbits who benefit from their wisdom, their attention and their companionship. Yet when so many people are entering that chapter all at once, shouldn’t we be paying more attention to how we can enhance the gift of long life with planning and preparation? Loved ones are often the first line of response when seniors need help with bathing, toileting, dressing or preparing meals, but as the needs grow, families may need to turn to outside help or long-term care, which a report from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation foundcan cost $60,000 a year or more. Shouldn’t we be paying more attention to how we can enhance the gift of long life with planning and preparation? That same report found thatfewer than half of adultshad ever had a serious conversation with their loved ones about who would take care of them if they became incapacitated. This is a good time for families to create their own master plans and assess how well prepared (or not) elders are for their later years. As noted above, states are bracing for this massive wave of elderly residents. Families might also want to seriously consider the impact on their finances, housing and ability to juggle caring for someone with great needs, while also keeping up with work and other responsibilities. During last year’s presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris laid out a proposal forexpanding Medicare to cover the cost of home-based long-term careand adjusting the spend-down requirements for Medicaid that can pull some recipients and their loved ones close to poverty before they qualify for services. It is unlikely that the Trump team would take up Harris’ specific proposal to reduce the price tag for long-term care. But because voters cited economic concerns as one of the reasons for voting for him, he would be wise to direct his administration to focus on easing the cost of aging in America. If you thinkthe price of eggsis high, just look at the monthly cost for in-home health care or rent at a housing complex for seniors. Overall, addressing this issue bumps up against a grim irony in politics, especially in a year where there has been a critical and you might even say withering focus on elder leaders in both parties who are thought to have stayed in their positions decades beyond the typical retirement age. That “how old is too old” political flashpoint means that some of the very officials who should be leading this discussion about the “gray wave” may be disinclined to draw attention to their own advanced age. I hope that changes, because American needs strong leadership on this issue. If not, the decision to ignore it won’t age well.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Delivering on the pledge he made to the Libertarian Party at itsconvention last summer, President Donald Trump on Tuesdaypardoned Ross Ulbricht, a former Eagle Scout and computer whiz who in 2011 created Silk Road, which became a huge global online market for illicit drugs. Likeother presidential pardonsof the past few weeks, Trump’s decision to free Ulbricht after nearly 12 years of incarceration hasdivided the public. So who has the better argument — the “Free Ross” libertarians or the “Let Him Rot in Prison” posse? That depends in large measure on how one assesses several key features of his case and the criminal justice system. Who has the better argument — the ‘Free Ross’ libertarians or the ‘Let Him Rot in Prison’ posse? Start with the conduct for which Ulbricht was convicted: abetting the distribution of narcotics, conspiracy to aid and abet computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic in fake IDs, conspiracy to launder money and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. Those charges certainly sound serious, even sinister, but they all arose out of his creation of an online marketplace where willing sellers and buyers could anonymously exchange payment for products, including illegal ones. Libertarians point to the fact that such marketplaces arise from the enforcement of paternalistic laws that make it a crime for people to buy, sell and consume substances that others don’t think they should put in their bodies. Most libertarians also believe that — as with smoking and the consumption of alcohol (which togetherkillmore than half a million peopleper year) — a person’s decision to consume illicit substances is a personal one that is properly none of the government’s business. And if someone creates an online marketplace where drug sales can be done more safely than on the street — which is precisely what Silk Road provided — then that should be none of the government’s business either. But wait, say Ulbricht’s vociferous critics — he didn’t just create Amazon Prime for drugs; he engaged in other, more culpable behavior, including soliciting murder for hire. As it happens, the government did accuse Ulbricht of paying to have several people killed, including some he suspected of embezzling money from him. But prosecutors chose not to include any of those charges in the case that went trial, so the jury never heard the government’s evidence or saw it tested in open court. Instead,the trial judge determined by a mere preponderance of the evidencethat Ulbricht had in fact solicited murder for hire and factored that into her rubble-bouncing sentence of two life terms, plus 40 years in prison. So much for the concept of innocent untilprovenguilty according to constitutionally established procedures. Moreover, there is ample reason to be suspicious both of the prosecution’s tactics and the integrity of its investigation, given thatat least two federal agents stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin from Ulbrichtwhile working undercover to help take him down. Those agents, Carl Force of the Drug Enforcement Administration and Shaun Bridges of the Secret Service, betrayed the public trust and sought to profit from their official positions. Upon conviction,they received 78 and 71 months, respectively — a tiny fraction of Ulbricht’s sentence and about half the time he actually served before being pardoned. Did Ulbricht deserve to have the slate wiped completely clean by a full presidential pardon instead of a commutation that would have left his conviction in place but sprung him from prison? Perhaps not. But is it justice for him to grow old and die in prison while sticky-fingered federal agents who corrupted the investigation and disgraced their badges walk free after serving their vastly less punitive sentences? Emphatically not. Clark Neily is senior vice president for legal studies at the Cato Institute.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows PresidentDonald Trump’s reputation as amaster of gaslightingis well deserved. And his contention that he’s a staunch defender of law enforcement might be the most maddening of all his falsehoods. Sure, he invented abig lieabout a massive conspiracy to steal the 2020 election that’s poisoned the brains of tens of millions of Americans and irreversibly damaged the integrity of the United States’ body politic. But it’s equally risible to profess that “I am a friend of police, more than any president who’s ever been in this office” shortly after pardoning or commuting the sentences of nearly everyone involved with theJan. 6 assault on the Capitol. Trump’s contention that he’s a staunch defender of law enforcement might be the most maddening of all his falsehoods. Those granted clemency by this self-proclaimed champion of law and order included the ringleaders of the attempted insurrection, rioters carrying (or wearing) Nazi andConfederate regaliaand chanting their intentions to murder then-Vice PresidentMike Penceand then-House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, as well as violent criminals whosavagely attacked police officers for hours. The phrase “Back the Blue” has long been used as a cudgel against anyone who dares criticize law enforcement officers and institutions. In this binary, you either unequivocally support cops or you’re a woke antifa terrorist. Until Trump pardoned the Jan. 6 rioters, “Back the Blue” was at its most absurd during the brief period earlier this decade when modest attempts at police reform were attempted (and mostly failed thanks in large part topolice union intransigence). In response, several states passed laws declaring police officers to be a protected identity group. This led, predictably, to ridiculously overbroad enforcement — like when a 19-year-old in 2021 wascharged with hate crime-enhancedcriminal mischief and disorderly conduct for allegedly destroying a “Blue Lives Matter” sign and for what the cop described as “smirking in an intimidating manner.” Now that Trump has escaped prosecution for attempting a self-coup, one would think he would have at least limited his blanket pardons to “nonviolent” rioters, if only out of respect for the thin blue line. In fact, he had even indicated the pardons would be carefully vetted and rioters who attacked cops might not be granted a presidential pass. But in the end, Trumpreportedly justimpulsively released them all with a one-page declaration, surprisingeven his own vice president. Among the convicted criminals whom Trump referred to as “hostages” unjustly arrested for their actions on a “day of love” is Ryan Nichols.NBC News reportedon the video evidence implicating Nichols: “Ryan Nichols said it, if you voted for f---ing treason we’re going to drag your f---ing a-- through the streets,” he said in the video as he marched to the Capitol. After he was seen on video spraying a giant canister of a chemical weapon at officers inside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel, Nichols bragged about his conduct on Facebook and called for more violence. “So if you want to know where Ryan Nichols stands, Ryan Nichols stands for violence,”he saidin a video cited by prosecutors. Pretty unambiguous stuff! And he’s hardly an outlier. Also according to NBC News, Daniel Rodriguez “used a stun gun and plunged it into the neck of Washington Police Officer Michael Fanone multiple times.” Prosecutors said David Dempsey used “his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on.” Andrew Taake had been sentenced to six years for “assaulting law enforcement officers with bear spray and a metal whip.” I could go on, with hundreds more names of violent Jan. 6 rioters and the crimes they committed, for which they have now been pardoned. One of the more recognizable rioters is Jacob Chansley — also known as the shirtless, horns-wearing “QAnon Shaman” — who boasted on X about buying “SOME MOTHA F***IN GUNS!!!” Four officers at the Capitol that day have since died by suicide, which are considered deaths in the line of duty. Sounds ominous! (Trump, a convicted felon, stillcannot legally possess firearms, per federal law.) TheFraternal Order of Police, the country’s largest police union and enthusiastic endorsers of Trump’s campaign, issued a vague and feeble message of disappointment — but not condemnation — of Trump’s pardons. Meanwhile, four officers at the Capitol that day have sincedied by suicide, which are considered deaths in the line of duty. More officers attacked that day continue to suffer from post-traumatic stress. Now they have to deal with both the indignity of watching their attackers walk free and the fear that the same people Trump incited to attack the Capitol will now take their retribution on the officers or their families. One former officer, Aquilino Gonell, posted on X, “The law and order dude is about to pardon those who assaulted the police. Collectively more than 40 rioters attacked me that day.” Among the top comments in response are a right-wing podcaster asking, “How many J6ers did you and your homies pepper spray and shoot rubber bullets at first?” and a pair of MAGA influencers with millions of followers saying, “You should be in prison bruh.” Another former officer, Michael Fanone, previously testified that he had been “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country” and earlier this month told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “My family, my children, and myself are less safe today because of Donald Trump and his supporters.” And that wasbeforethe pardons. Still another officer, Daniel Hodges, remains on active duty with the Metropolitan Police and worked to protect Trump on his second Inauguration Day. He testified to the House Jan. 6 committee: “To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin-blue-line flag — the symbol of support for law enforcement — more than once being carried by the terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us.” To be sure, Trump’s pardon-palooza didn’t completely leave out the cops. Some of Trump’s pardon giftees were law enforcement officers themselves, and they’re now free to rejoin those ranks. Also,Trump pardoned two officersin Washington, D.C., who were convicted of second-degree murder, conspiracy to obstruct, and obstruction of justice. So it’s not like he doesn’t completely “Back the Blue.” Trump and his supporters often refer to his 1.5 percentage-point victory in the 2024 popular vote as a mandate.Recent pollshave shownroughly 60% of Americansoppose pardoning Jan. 6 rioters — a much larger mandate! Andthough a handful of Republicans in Congressexpressed disapproval of the pardons, most eitherbacked pardons for those who attacked the blue, or cravenly stayed silent. Though Trump’s apologists dismiss the violence on Jan. 6 as an episode of brief and unfortunate unrest, I find it difficult to imagine that had the mob reached Mike Pence or Nancy Pelosi, or any member of Congress, they would’ve merely stopped their rage march and civilly expressed grievances about the 2020 election. These were violent people caught up in a mob hell-bent on finding an outlet for their rage. And if not for thequick thinkingof a rank-and-file Capitol cop, that mob likely would have found at least some of their targets. We could be talking today about the violence they committed when they got their hands on Pence and Pelosi, in addition to a few hundred police officers. Today, these would-be assassins and insurrectionists who nearly killed cops (and in many cases, openly bragged about it on the internet) are free to live their lives, to own guns and to run for elected office. Trump has even indicated he’s “open” tohosting some of the rioters at the White House, adding, “What they didis they were protesting a crooked election. People understand that also. And they were treated very badly.” The cops they attacked, meanwhile, are sentenced by Trump to live in fear. Anthony L. Fisher is a senior editor and writer for MSNBC Daily.

Earlier this month, Iwroteabout some of these Republicans, including far-right influencer Charlie Kirk, who said the funds should be contingent on California firing Kristin Crowley, Los Angeles’ first female and openly gay fire chief. And President Donald Trump has blamed the fires on California’s water distribution policy, thoughexperts have pushed backon such claims. That hasn’t stopped him from demanding that California officials change their water policy. Over the weekend, Trump added to his apparent list of conditions for California to receive federal fire aid, telling reporters on Friday that the state should impose a voting law thatmany legal experts say is voter suppression. “In California, I have a condition,” he said during a news conference while visiting hurricane-affected areas of North Carolina. “In California, we want them to have voter ID so the people have a voice, because right now the people don’t have a voice, because you don’t know who’s voting and it’s very corrupt.” There’s no evidence California’s voting system is corrupt or rife with voter fraud. As Gov. Gavin Newsom’s officeposted to Xon Friday: “Under current CA law you must be a CA resident and US citizen (and attest to being one under penalty of perjury) AND provide a form of ID such as driver’s license or passport that has been approved by the Secretary of State in order to register to vote.” Trump’s proposed remedy to fix this nonexistent problem of widespread voter fraud, enhanced “voter ID,”  is conservative parlance for policies that experts and activists often warndisproportionately harm nonwhite voters and other marginalized groups for various reasons. Trump’s ultimatum is all the more disturbing when you consider that the town of Altadena, which hasa significant Black population, was severely hurt by the wildfires in California. Now he’s suggesting making their recovery contingent on California accepting policies that could make it harder for some of those people to vote. So here, we have a scenario that feels similar to what led toTrump’s first impeachment for requesting a political favorin exchange for congressionally authorized aid to Ukraine. (The GOP-controlled Senate ultimately voted to acquit him.) In California’s case, Trump is being more explicit in demanding political concessions in exchange for vital aid. And he’s not threatening to withhold aid Congress has already authorized. He’s getting out in front of the negotiations entirely. On that note, shoutout to U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who looked Trump in the eye during a meeting last Friday and warned that his cruel ultimatum could easily come back to hurt Republicans if a Democrat regains the White House and decides to use similar tactics against conservative-led states.

My son was kicking my ribs as I fought back tears while Ford testified that the laughter from the man who allegedly sexually assaulted her was “indelible in the hippocampus.” “The details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget,” she said, her voice shaking at times. “They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.” Despite accusations of sexual assault and domestic violence, yet another man has been buoyed by lawmakers and members of Congress to occupy one of the highest offices of federal government. Six years later, asPete Hegsethisconfirmed as President Donald Trump's next defense secretary, those details are haunting my memory, too. Because despiteaccusations of sexual assaultanddomestic violence, yet another man has been buoyed by lawmakers and members of Congress to occupy one of the highest offices of federal government — seemingly unscathed,confident and with an all-too-familiar smirk. The allegations levied against the former Fox News host have so far apparently beenfar from disqualifying. In 2017, Hegseth was investigated for sexual assault by California authorities after a woman accused him of raping her at a Monterey hotel. The woman,  referred to in the case as Jane Doe,claimedHegseth “blocked the door” to the hotel room “with his body” and, according to a police report from the Monterey California Police Department, she “remembered saying ‘no’ a lot.” She later went to the hospital because she believed she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth.According to authorities, she underwent a rape kit and had contusions on her right thigh. Hegseth has repeatedly denied the allegations, and in 2018 Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni declined to pursue the case after determining that “no charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” Hegsethlater paid the woman a $50,000 settlement, according to written answers he provided to Sen. Elizabeth Warren during the vetting process for his slated role as defense secretary. Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, confirmed a settlement payment had been made but declined to confirm the amount. During his confirmation hearing, Hegseth described the allegations as a “coordinated smear campaign,” arguing that he is innocent but “not a perfect person.” “But redemption is real,” Hegseth continued, adding that he has been “saved by the grace of God” and his current wife, Jennifer Rauchet. Like Kavanaugh, who claimed he was thevictim of a “political hit” orchestratedby a “frenzy on the left,”Hegseth has tended to blame“left-wing media”for turning him into a victim of a “smear campaign” orchestrated by“anonymous sources.” And like Kavanaugh — for whomTrump’s first administration reportedly heavily controlled the FBI investigation into Ford’s allegations— the soon-to-be secretary of defense appears to be sailing through a contentious confirmation hearing despite anFBI background check and investigationthat Democratic Sen. Jack Reed has said was “insufficient.” We are once again watching a sitting president of the United States — who himself has faced (and denied) many allegations of sexual misconduct and has beenfound liable for sexual abuse— come to the defense of a controversial nominee. In 2019, Trump argued that  Kavanaugh should “start suing people for libel,” adding that the “lies being told about him are unbelievable.” On Friday morning, ahead of Hegseth’s seemingly inevitable confirmation, Trump described Hegseth as a “good man.” “Pete’s a very, very good man,” the president said. “I hope he makes it; I hope he makes it.” Hegseth has indeed “made it” — even after Armed Services Committee members received a sworn affidavit from Hegseth’s former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, claiming hissecond wife feared for her personal safetyduring their marriage, at one point hiding from her then-husband in a closet. (Hegseth denied the allegations and, in a statement to NBC News, his ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth, said there was “no physical abuse in my marriage.”) As was the case with Kavanaugh, only two Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins — are willing to break from party lines. Sen. Mike Rounds told reportersthat the affidavit “doesn’t change anything,” adding that it’s just another instance of a “third party coming in saying something which is directly contradictory to what the individual they’ve identified has said.” As was the case with Kavanaugh, only two Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins — are willing to break from party lines. “If you think Vladimir Putin or anyone else isn’t watching this circus of Pete Hegsteh and laughing at how we’re putting someone so uniquely unqualified by their disposition and their experience, you have another think coming,”Sen. Jacky Rosen told MSNBC’s Ana Cabrera. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,” Ford once said, “the uproarious laughter between the two [men] and their having fun at my expense.” In 2018, after two of his former White House aides quit amid accusations of domestic violence, Trump claimed men’s lives are being “shattered and destroyed by mere allegations.” “Some are true and some are false,”he tweeted at the time. “Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused — life and career gone.” When applied to Pete Hegseth’s confirmation, Trump’s statement is a proven lie. Instead, Hegseth’s confirmation serves as a continuation of Trump and the Republican Party’s ongoing victimhood campaign. With every credible accusation of rape, assault or violence comes a wave of “woe is me” declarations at war with their hyper-masculine facades. Men like Kavanaugh, Hegseth and Trump are at once the epitome of rugged virility and perpetually fragile targets of so-called “dangerous” women. It has become a feature, not a bug, of many far-right heroes to receive accusations of gender-based violence — a sure-fire way to fail upward while being hailed as a conquering hero, leaving a trail of Jane Does in their wake. I’m now five weeks postpartum with my third child — a girl — as I once again watch a man accused of violence against women ascend to a powerful political position. Instead of a kick to the ribs, I am navigating sleepless nights and breastfeeding pains as I grapple with the inescapable reality that not much has changed when it comes to the ways society views my sons and now my daughter. I could hope — against my better judgment and against all evidence to the contrary — that, after another six years pass, things will look very different. I can hope that accusations of assault against men in positions of power will carry more weight and require more than perfunctory inquiries or mild concern. But even if that is the case, and we demand more of our elected officials and their Cabinet and judicial appointees, the details of what society has come to accept will undoubtedly remain “indelible in the hippocampus” of this country’s collective psyche.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows ByJa'han Jones The Trump administration’s anti-immigration raids appear to be ensnaring all sorts of legal residents in the United States. On Thursday, the 25th Navajo Nation Counciladdressed reports— including one from an Arizona state lawmaker — that members of their tribe had been swept up in the raids being conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Arizona state Sen. Theresa Hatathlie, a Democrat, noted that many members of the tribe may lack federally recognized identification documents. The following day, the office of Navajo Nation President Buu Nygrenissued a news releaseciting “negative, sometimes traumatizing, experiences” among Navajos and advising tribal members to “carry state-issued identification, such as a driver’s license, other picture identification, or their Certificate of Indian blood, known as a CIB.” This appears to be the kind of dubious profiling that activists feared Trump would unleash as president. Essentially, that means Navajos are being encouraged to carry their“freedom papers”to avoid harassment from Trump’s immigration officials. This appears to be the kind of dubious profiling that activistsfeared Trump would unleashas president. And it’s more than a little ironic that a crusade supposedly designed to make America great is harassing people who arguably have more right to be here — legally and morally — than just about anyone else. Nygren’s news release said his office has been in contact with members of Congress and officials from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the governors of Arizona and Mexico. On Monday,CNN reported: At least 15 Indigenous people in Arizona and New Mexico have reported being stopped at their homes and workplaces, questioned or detained by federal law enforcement and asked to produce proof of citizenship during immigration raids since Wednesday, according to Navajo Nation officials.  These don’t appear to be the only incidents of mistaken immigration status by ICE, and they won’t be the last. Last week in Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Barakareleased a statementafter an ICE raid in his city, saying that citizens — including a U.S. military veteran with military documentation — had been detained without the agents producing a warrant. “This egregious act is in plain violation of the Fourth Amendment,” Baraka wrote. ICE, for what it’s worth, essentially said such acts are simply the cost of doing business. “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual’s identity,” the agencysaid in a statement.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows PresidentDonald Trumpsays we’re going to Mars, but don’t start packing your bags just yet. There are a lot of reasons to doubt that his plans will get us to the Red Planet, and he may even put us further behind schedule. Inhis inaugural addressMonday, Trump said the country would “pursue our manifest destiny into the stars” and “plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.” Almost everything that Trump has said and done indicates that a trip to Mars is about as likely to happen as Trump's broken first-term promise to repeal Obamacare. It’s an ambitious goal and one of the few he’s laid out for his second term that has broad support. Ina 2023 poll, 57% of Americans favored sending astronauts to Mars, making itmuch more popularthanTrump’s pardons for Jan. 6 participants,attempt to overturn birthright citizenshipand proposal forbroad-based tariffs on foreign goods, all of which majorities oppose. But other than that single sentence, almost everything Trump has said and done indicates that a trip to Mars is about as likely to happen as Trump’sbroken first-term promisesto repeal Obamacare, make Mexico pay for a border wall and guarantee six weeks of paid family leave. In that term, Trump also said America would go to Mars, signing legislation that directed NASA to plan a mission that would launch in 2033. But he was so blasé about his own proposal that he apparently forgot about it when holding a video chat with an astronaut that same year, then got annoyed whenshe notedthat the Mars landing wouldn’t happen before he left office. A trip to Mars was included inthe 2024 Republican platform, which said only that the U.S. would “create a robust Manufacturing Industry in Near Earth Orbit, send American Astronauts back to the Moon, and onward to Mars.” (To be fair, theDemocratic platformalso included only one sentence, noting that NASA would send Americans “back to the moon and to Mars.”) But Mars does not appear in the Trump campaign’sAgenda 47list of core promises or the detailedProject 2025 proposalfrom conservative groups, which doesn’t even have a section on NASA. Even in these abbreviated references, you might notice a subtle change that could prove consequential. All of them reference America going back to the moon for the first time since 1972 and then to Mars. But Trump skipped past the moon. A clue to the reason for that omission comes from billionaire SpaceX founder Elon Musk, whopostedon X in December that “we’re going straight to Mars” and called a moon mission “a distraction.” NASA hasn’t seen it that way. Its goal has long been to use the planned Artemis moon missions as a first step toward going to Mars, testing the larger crewed spaceships on a trip that would take only days instead of the months it would take to get to Mars — kind of like taking the kids to a nearby Six Flags to see if they’re ready to go to Disney World. But it sounds like Trump is following Musk’s lead. He hasnominated billionaire Jared Isaacman,who has paid for two private trips to space on SpaceX rockets and is close with Musk, to lead NASA. And heskipped over a career officialwho has defended the Artemis program when appointing an acting administrator to serve until Isaacman can be confirmed. Some NASA observersthink Trump will cancelthe moon missions. It’s hard to find the logic in any of this. The directive to return to the moon before going to Mars literally came from Trump himself in his first term. If Trump doesn’t cancel it, NASA is planning to send a crewed spaceship on a flyby of the moon in 2026 and land on the moon in 2027. Unlike John F. Kennedy, whose moon shot was finally achieved under his one-time opponent, Richard Nixon, Trump could celebrate his own moon mission while still serving as president. Trump clearly wants some kind of a space triumph. Hecreated the Space Forceand said he wanted to go to Mars by the end of his first term. Hesaid at a rallywith Musk in October that America would go to Mars before the end of his second term, though he didn’t specify whether that meant an unmanned spacecraft or actual American space boots on the ground. He’s not the first president to propose going to Mars. President George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush both proposed sending astronauts to the Red Planet. But while popular, the idea often founders because it’s so costly. A2016 estimateput the figure at half a trillion dollars. The price has only gone up since then, and we stilldon’t have the technologyto keep astronauts alive on such a long ride or develop the fuel for a return trip. Because missions to Mars can only happen when the two planets are relatively close to each other, there’s basically only one chance to send a spaceship there during Trump’s second term, which would be in late 2026, which is far too soon given the technological limitations we’re already up against. To sum it all up: Trump appears ready to upend years of planning for a moon mission that he proposed in favor of a dramatic new plan to go to Mars that has not been fleshed out in any way, likely as a favor to a billionaire friend who would personally benefit if NASA awarded a contract worth hundreds of billions of dollars to his company and on behalf of a promise that requires developing and launching unproven technology in the next two years. That’s not gonna happen. This is a moon shot proposal that won’t take us back to the moon, and likely won’t take us to Mars, either. Ryan Teague Beckwith is a newsletter editor for MSNBC.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows American presidents throughout history have broken with precedent before, but for a president-elect tolaunch a crypto “meme coin”days before his inauguration is really out there on the bleeding edge of the untested. AsDonald Trumpreturns to the White House following his 2024 electoral victory, his association with a meme coin launch represents an unprecedented convergence ofpresidential influenceand speculative finance. EvenAndrew Jackson, who had a notorious appetite for gambling and financial risk, never displayed such brazenness as to promote an investment product on the eve of assuming office. These are purely speculative instruments, unapologetically existing for no reason other than to enrich their creators. While the value of established cryptocurrencies remains a subject ofconsiderable debateamong economists andtechnologists, other cryptocurrencies often peddle a narrative justification centered on utility. Proponents of bitcoin, for instance, suggest its potential as a digital analog to gold, or as a payment network; ethereum adherents point to so-calledsmart contracts. Whether such proposed applications ultimately prove viable remains highly questionable, and many critics argue that these narratives are fundamentally incoherent. Meme coins, in contrast, dispense with the pretense of utility or narrative: These are purelyspeculative instruments, unapologetically existing for no reason other than to enrich their creators. The mechanics of meme coins are remarkably straightforward: Initial purchasers acquire tokens at a nominal cost. Publicity intensifies, often fueled by social media amplification and a fear of being left behind, and prices spike. Early investors can then sell their holdings to later buyers at a profit. This dynamic, however, is inherently unsustainable, and the inevitable result is that subsequent investors are left holding largely valueless digital tokens that are untethered from any asset or income. It’s a mathematical certainty that a majority of participants will incur financial losses — the only question is the precise distribution of those losses. The value of these tokens rests solely on their ability to induce successive purchasers to pay an inflated price, a characteristic that invites comparison to pyramid schemes without the overt promise of guaranteed returns. The launch ofthe Trumps’ tokensjust before the inauguration represents a troubling development in the realm of money in politics. It’s shocking to have the presidential office even tangentially connected to such a nakedly speculative financial undertaking at such a sensitive political moment. This timing seems to suggest that supporting the candidate and engaging in a risky financial gamble are somehow connected, a notion that raises significant ethical concerns about the influence ofpersonal financial interestsonpolitical decision-makingand could potentially leadto conflicts of interest. The dangers surrounding meme coins arise not so much because they exist in a regulatory vacuum, but because some crypto businesses operate with a cynical disregard for the laws wealreadyhave. Traditional financial markets have rules that forbid predatory offerings and market manipulation and that require disclosures, but many crypto operations openly flout these regulations, knowing that regulators are often too underresourced to enforce them. The result is a perfect storm for market manipulation, with concentrated ownership and coordinated buying campaigns conducted openly on social media platforms. This pattern of market behavior is eerily reminiscent of the “robber baron” era of the late 19th century. Before the advent of securities laws, powerful figures amassed fortunes through schemes that often left ordinary investors in financial ruin. That era, characterized by limited regulatory oversight, allowed many predatory schemes and abuses that ultimately led to the modern securities regulations that govern traditional finance today. What’s particularly fraught about the present circumstance is the combination of a historically familiar pattern with the speed and reach of digital technology, and now the direct association with a presidential transition. Potential buyers may not understand that they’re not investing in anything real — they’re merely buying tokens in a digital game of hot potato, where the only way to win is to pass their holdings to someone else at a higher price before the music stops. The overall rise of crypto reflects a deeper nihilism in American culture — a collective rejection of fundamental value and the premise of markets. The overall rise of crypto reflects a deeper nihilism in American culture — a collective rejection of fundamental value and the premise of markets. In this worldview, if investing is a rigged game, why not embrace the absurdity? Such a cynical perspective approaches markets as a mere casino where the only things that matter are momentum and hype. That this mindset has become intertwined with the presidency, with tokens backed by nothing but vanity and political loyalty, reveals a profound loss of faith in institutions and the very concept of value itself. For the public, the message should be unequivocal: Meme coins, irrespective of their branding or timing, are not legitimate investments. They are speculative gambles, more like lottery tickets than financial assets. When draped in political symbolism and launched at times of heightened public attention, they become an especially dangerous proposition: a chimera of political devotion and financial recklessness that is fraught with moral hazard and does not serve the public interest. The launch of a personal meme coin by a president represents a dangerous confluence of political power and speculative finance that would be bad on its own. More fundamentally — and more troubling — it represents a betrayal of the duty of the office. Using the highest office of the land to promote a financial product designed to transfer wealth from the public to a private individual undermines the institutional integrity of the presidency itself. The Trump meme coin may be just the latest chapter in this ongoing story, but it signals a troubling new direction in the use of political influence for financial gain.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows BySteve Benen On the first full day of his second term as president, Donald Trump attended a national prayer service in Washington, where he sat and listened to the bishop of the local Episcopal Diocese. It quickly became quite memorable: The Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Buddespoke truth to power, urging the newly inaugurated president to reconsiderhis attacks on marginalized communities. Trump reacted furiously, and among Republicans, he was hardly alone.House Speaker Mike Johnsonand the newWhite House press secretarycondemned the bishop’s sermon, and Fox News personalitiesrepeatedlylashedoutatBudde on the air. One GOP lawmaker went so far as to introduce a congressional resolutionto formally condemnher remarks — and it quickly picked up20 Republican co-sponsors. It served as a timely reminder thattoo often in GOP circles, religion is treated as something that must be celebrated, protected and respected — just so long as the faith community is telling the party what it wants to hear. In fact, the first week of the Trump era ended on a similar note to the way in which it began. JD Vance sat down with CBS’s Margaret Brennan for his first on-air interview as vice president, and the “Face the Nation” host reminded her guest that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week condemned some of Trump’s executive orders, most notably the administration’s new policy on allowing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to enter houses of worship. “Do you personally support the idea of conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school?” the host asked. The Ohio Republican, who is himself a Roman Catholic,replied: Of course, if you have a person who is convicted of a violent crime, whether they’re an illegal immigrant or a non-illegal immigrant, you have to go and get that person to protect the public safety. That’s not unique to immigration. But let me just address this particular issue, Margaret. Because as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement. And I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?  So, a few things. Right off the bat, it was curious to hear Vance say that officials have a responsibility to “get” those convicted of violent crimes “to protect the public safety.”Trump’s pardons for violent Jan. 6 felonssuggest the Republican White House has already rejected the vice president’s assertion. What's more, it’s unusual, to put it mildly, to see a prominent American political leader use such pointed language in reference to Catholic leaders. “Are they actually worried about their bottom line?” is the kind of question that, I suspect, will not be well received by the USCCB. But let’s also not brush past the larger context. In recent years, in instances in which the Biden administration disagreed with the Roman Catholic Church, Trump and other Republicans werequick to accuse the former Democratic presidentof being “against God,” “against the Bible” and “essentially against religion.” At the Republican National Convention, one speakercondemned Biden— by all accounts, a devout Catholic — as a “Catholic in name only.” What are the chances Republicans will hear similar talk after a week in which party leaders launched a hysterical offensive against Budde and publicly questioned whether Catholic bishops are principally concerned with “their bottom line”?

A month later, again on a Friday night, the Republicanalso firedthe inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. A couple of weeks later, he did the same thing to the State Department’s inspector general — late on a Friday night. The New York Timesreportedthat the White House appeared to be engaged in a “power play against semi-independent inspectors general across the government,” driven by the president’s “impatience with independent voices within the government that he considers disloyal.” The Washington Post’s David Ignatius similarlycalled outTrump for launching “a relentless campaign — waged even in the midst of the pandemic — against people and institutions that can hold him accountable.” In the final year of his first term, the Republican ended upousting four of these watchdog officials. As his second term gets underway, Trump is picking up where he left off. My MSNBC colleagueClarissa-Jan Lim highlightedthe president’s latest move against inspectors general — who were once again targeted late on a Friday night. President Donald Trump fired multiple inspectors general late on Friday, removing the independent watchdogs tasked with investigating abuse and impropriety in federal agencies in a move that potentially violates federal law. ... The exact number of inspectors general who were dismissed is unclear. NBC News reported that at least 12 were fired. The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the actions, reported the number as at least 14 across several agencies.  Right off the bat, the obvious problem with such a move is the apparent motivation: Inspectors general are responsible for investigating internal wrongdoing, possible ethical lapses, alleged corruption and fraud, and mismanagement. For Trump, who is no stranger to corruption accusations, to target these watchdogs raises all kinds of questions about the kind of actions the new administration hopes to get away with in the coming weeks, months and years. Relatedly, one of the fired inspectors generaltold The Washington Post, “It’s a widespread massacre. Whoever Trump puts in now will be viewed as loyalists, and that undermines the entire system.” But perhaps most important of all is the apparent fact that the White House’s action is at odds with federal law. TheNew York Times reporton the developments explained, “The firings defied a law that requires presidents to give Congress 30 days’ advance notice before removing any inspector general, along with reasons for the firing. Just two years ago, Congress strengthened that provision byrequiring the notice to include a ‘substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons” for the removal.’” It led Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer, to tell MSNBC’s Jen Psaki that Trump’s move was “a nakedly illegal action.” Not surprisingly, congressional Democrats wasted little time in expressing outrage. Senate Minority Leader Schumer called it “a chilling purge,” and “a preview of the lawless approach Donald Trump and his administration is taking.” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said the move was “a brazen attempt to rig these offices to look the other way when violations of law take place.” Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, labeled it Trump’s “midnight massacre.” By way of a defense, the president told reporters that his move was “a very common thing to do.” This was, of course, the opposite of the truth: Since the existing law was created, there have been no such mass firings of inspectors general. But just as important was the reaction from congressional Republicans. Four years ago, when Trump targeted inspectors general,a variety of GOP officials pushed back. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa — by any fair measure, a leader for many years on protecting inspectors general —was especially incensed. But in the aftermath of Trump’s Friday night firings,one GOP officialafter anotherlined upto expresssupportorindifference. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” conceded that the firings appeared to be “technically” illegal, but the South Carolinian endorsed the move anyway. Even Grassley said, “There may be good reason the IGs were fired,” though the Iowan said he’d like “further explanation.” The president's Friday night move was indefensible. The GOP reaction added insult to injury. As for the near future, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, which represents inspectors general, issued a statement questioning the legality of Trump’s purge, suggesting some important court fights are on the horizon.

Though MAGA world had misconstrued Petro’s position as an opposition to deportation flights generally, hehad objectedto U.S. military planes being used. He had demanded that Colombian migrants be treated with dignity. Though MAGA world had misconstrued Petro’s position as an opposition to deportation flights generally, he had objected to U.S. military planes being used. “A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,”Petro said in a post on X. “That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants... In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.” For a fleeting moment, it looked like going after Trump was a political risk Petro was willing to take. Responding to Trump’s announcement that he’d put tariffs on Colombian imports that would start at 25% on all goods and quickly rise to 50% and the promise of a “Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations on the Colombian Government Officials, and all Allies and Supporters,” Petro responded on X that those sanctions “do not scare me”and said that Colombiais “not anyone’s colony.” At one point, Petro even equated Trump with a “white enslaver.” “I resisted torture, and I will resist you,” Petro said at one point in Spanish. “I don’t want enslavers near Colombia. We’ve had enough, and we freed ourselves. What I want for Colombia are lovers of freedom. If you cannot stand beside me, I will turn elsewhere.” He added: “You may kill me, but I will survive through my people, who existed before yours, in the Americas. We are the people of the winds, the mountains, the Caribbean Sea, and of freedom.” But in the end, the lofty Latin American resistance rhetoric was for naught. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday that Colombia “has agreed to all of President Trump’s terms,” including the “unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.” The Colombian government issued a face-saving statementclaiming that its impasse with the United States had been resolved through diplomatic efforts. “We will continue to receive Colombians deported under conditions that guarantee dignity and respect as citizens with full rights,” part of the statement read. Sunday must have been especially challenging for Latinos who said they voted for Trump believing he would improve the economy, and didn’t believe he would be this extreme this soon against their communities and the Latin American countries they share origins with. The misinformation that the MAGA world was circulating Sunday — that Colombia was blocking deportation flights in general — was distressing but not surprising.  To suggest that Colombia hasn’t been a willing partner in the long history of American immigration enforcement policy is laughable. According to the Department of Homeland Security,between 2014 and 2023, 22% of Colombian nationals encountered by U.S. immigration authorities were repatriated.Telemundo cited Witness at the Border tracking datathat between 2020 and 2024, Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights, the fifth-most of any country. In August,Colombia joined the United States and Panamain issuing a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to managing migration flows through the Darién Gap. This trilateral agreement emphasized collaborative efforts to enhance security and address irregular migration, underscoring Colombia’s ongoing role as a reliable partner. Military deportations send an entirely different message, one that understandably stirs painful memories of U.S. interventionism in Latin America. However, military deportations send an entirely different message, one that understandably stirs painful memories of U.S. interventionism in Latin America and undermines Colombia’s sovereignty. Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, his state’s first Latino senator,posted during the Trump-Petro row: “Colombia has stopped millions of migrants from coming to the U.S. Trump’s strategy of antagonizing our allies is not smart policy—it just endangers decades of partnership with Colombia. We can’t act like this is some sort of 3D chess. This could’ve been handled with a simple phone call.” But a “simple phone call” wasn’t what Trump or his supporters wanted. They wanted toresurrect the Monroe Doctrineandmanifest destinywith flash, power and propaganda. They wanted to play the role of the tough, ugly American neighbor, vanquishing anyone perceived as weaker in the eyes of American imperialism and expansionism. First, there’s the threat to take the Panama Canal. Then, the Gulf of Mexico being renamed the Gulf of America in an executive order. Now, there’s the bullying of Colombia. And that’s Colombia, not Columbia,as the White House reportedly misspelledit in a press statement about the tariffs. Not spelling the country’s name correctly is another sign of disrespect. By Sunday night, the White House was gloating about Colombia’s total capitulation. The message is clear: If you don’t submit to the Trump way, he will make sure to leave the door open to exert whatever pressure he can. “We’ve got a strong president willing to demand action. If they don’t act, then there’ll be consequences,” border czar Tom Homantold NBC NewsSunday night. The swiftness with which the Trump administration claimed victory underscores the enduring imbalance of power between the United States and Latin America. Homan’s comments encapsulate the Trump administration’s strategy: force compliance through economic threats and public bluster, all while framing any resistance as a failure of the opposing government. Petro’s words resonated with those who see the region as more than a pawn in America’s power plays. Yet, the swiftness with which the Trump administration claimed victory underscores the enduring imbalance of power between the United States and Latin America. For all Petro’s fiery words, the reality remains: resistance is costly, and in this case, Petro determined that his country couldn’t pay that price.

Many believed that after the public outcry and reversal by Trump officials, this shameful chapter of American history would close. Make no mistake: Mass deportation equals mass family separation. Approximately 4.4 million children who are U.S. citizens have undocumented parents. Yet this won’t happen if the new president follows through on his threat of mass deportations of all undocumented immigrants. Trump and those he’s gathered around him have repeatedly stated they would deport all undocumented immigrants.Make no mistake: Mass deportation equals mass family separation. Approximately4.4 million childrenwho are U.S. citizens have undocumented parents. Of the estimated11 million undocumentedimmigrants in the U.S., a substantial number have minor children who are U.S. citizens and cannot legally be deported. To fulfill his campaign promises, Trump will need to either separate more than 4 million U.S.-citizen children from their parents — or illegally deport more than 4 million U.S.-citizen children to countries they’ve never known.Some 5,500 childrenwere separated from their parents during Trump’s first term. These separations devastated these families and plunged the Department of Homeland Security into crisis, as was detailed inthe new MSNBC documentary “Separated” by reporter Jacob Soboroff. Yet now, millions of U.S. children at are at risk, including undocumented children. I’m a pediatrician who has studiedthe harms of family separation. I know that either outcome would be a human rights, humanitarian and health catastrophe without precedent. When Kristen Welker, the host of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” recentlyasked Trump about his deportation plan’s effect on families, Trump presented two options. He said, “They can all go out together,” meaning children who are citizens would be deported, or deported parents could leave their children behind. He said “the family has a choice.” This “choice” forces families into an untenable position. Deporting families together ignores the reality that we’re talking about children who’ve built their entire lives here. Forcing them to leave the only country they’ve ever known would mean abandoning their education, communities and other family members in the States. For many, it would mean returning to a place their parents fled because of war, torture, persecution or other turmoil. I have witnessed firsthand the severe trauma — indeed the torture — that these separations inflict. In my two decades of pediatric medicine practice and extensive work documenting family separation cases with Physicians for Human Rights, I have witnessed firsthand the severe trauma —indeed the torture, as a seminal PHR report concluded— that these separations inflict. Through my clinical practice and research, I know that children who have undergone such adverse childhood experienceshave changes to their brainthat we can see on an MRI, physiological and metabolic changes to their body and lifelong psychological effects, including severe depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Asone father I interviewedasked me: Who can return the formative years of these children’s lives back to their families? Who can go back in time and be the parents who lovingly taught them to tie their shoelaces or ride their bikes? Who can repair those broken bonds? No one can. The immense damagethat family separation causes to children and parents is clear. In addition to the psychological harms, affected families could seea nearly 50% reduction in household income, the Center for Migration Studies has reported. This increases the chances of food insecurity and often leads to chronic stress, which can negatively impact health and development. Researchers are also sounding the alarm on how deporting millions of immigrant families would hobble the agricultural, construction, food service and many other industries, resulting in higher prices for everyone. What message does it send when we force millions of American-citizen children to choose between their families and their birthright citizenship? These are not theoretical questions; they are decisions that will devastate families who have built their lives in the U.S. The proposed mass deportations will lead only to mass separation, mass trauma and mass chaos on a scale far beyond what we witnessed during Trump’s first term. Who looks at the crisis of family separation in Trump’s first term — when some 5,500 children were separated — and believes we should scale it up 800 times? We are at a moment that will define not just our immigration policy, but our national character. We are at a moment that will define not just our immigration policy, but our national character. While the challenges of immigration reform are complex, so-called solutions that traumatize children, fragment families and force American citizens to choose between their own homeland or deportation with their parents violate both our values and our medical understanding of human development. Regardless of political affiliation, we must pursue immigration policies that maintain family unity, protect children’s well-being, and recognize the deep roots many immigrant families have established in our communities. The alternative — implementing mass deportations that would separate millions of families — would inflict generational trauma that no future policy or administration could repair.

The president and his followers have falsely portrayed diversity, equity and inclusion programs as illegal and discriminatory against straight white men, in particular. And hegave his bigoted threats some teeththis week when he ordered his attorney general to compile a report with “recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.” Multiple companies — includingMcDonald’sandWalmart— already had acquiesced and shut down their diversity initiatives, andTargetjoined the list Friday.

Multiple companies — including McDonald’s and Walmart — already had acquiesced and shut down their diversity initiatives, and Target joined the list Friday. Costco is receiving some online praise, for example, aftermore than 98% of shareholders recently rejecteda shareholder proposal for a report on any risks posed by the company’s DEI policies. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon have faced similar activist proposals at their companies, but speaking at this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,both said they remain committedto seeking out diverse talent despite the right-wing crusade. Asked in a CNBC interview about the anti-DEI push among investors, Dimon said: “Bring them on.” A number of other CEOs at Davos, including Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, Vista Equity Partners CEO Robert Smith and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins,all vowed that their companies will remain committedto prioritizing diversity even as they navigate the new legal terrain under Trump. And good on them for that. Let’s hope they follow through, because doing so makes good business sense. DEI programs help foster work environments that studies have shown aremore productive than ones where diversity isn’t emphasized. So it’s fair to say the businesses that bend to the MAGA movement on this issue are spiting themselves. And the companies that don’t are equipping themselves to truly compete and excel in a world that is only getting more diverse. Ja’han Jones is The ReidOut Blog writer.

Colombian officials said their country would accept planes of migrants who tried to enter the United States illegally, but they objected to military jets landing on Colombian soil. With this in mind, Colombia did, in fact, turn away deportation flights, prompting a rather hysterical response from Donald Trump, who announced “emergency” tariffs and a diplomatic response that the Republican presidentdescribed as“a Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations on the Colombian Government Officials, and all Allies and Supporters.” But just as Americans started facing the prospect ofmore expensive coffee and cut flowers, among other products, the two countries came to an apparent agreement.NBC News reported: The White House said Sunday that Colombia has agreed to all of President Donald Trump’s terms after Trump threatened to impose sweeping retaliatory measures against it, including tariffs and visa sanctions, after it denied entry to two U.S. military deportation flights.  Of course, the fact that the U.S. administration appears to be getting the outcome it wanted makes it far more likely that Trump will use similar tactics with other countries going forward. But stepping back, it’s hard not to notice that this was hardly the only international incident the Republican created in the first week of his second term. Trump’s comments about wanting to “clean out“ Gaza and relocate Palestinians to other countrieshave reportedly“astonished moderate Arab leaders who had been looking forward to working with him.” His commentsblaming Ukraine for Russia’s invasionwill likely do little to end the war. Trump’s ambitions about acquiring Greenland have led him to make increasingly provocative comments directed at officials in Denmark — a NATO ally. “I think we’re going to have it,”the president said over the weekend, referring to taking control of Greenland. He added, “I don’t know really what claim Denmark has to it. But it would be a very unfriendly act if they didn’t allow that to happen.” The Trump administration’sforeign-aid freezeisaffecting international programs“aimed at alleviating hunger, disease and wartime suffering around the globe, as well as ones that help nations with economic development.” Panamasubmitted a formal letter to the United Nationslast week, rejecting the Republican’s comments about reclaiming the Panama Canal. The German ambassador to the United States last week reportedlywrote a diplomatic reportwarning that Trump’s return to power will pose new threats to American democracy and our constitutional system. And in case that weren’t quite enough, Trump also had some comments last week about the international BRICS coalition, which heoccasionally pretends to understand. “They’re a BRICS nation, Spain,”the president told reporters. “You know what a BRICS nation is? You’ll figure it out.” Spain is not, in reality, a part of BRICS — and Spanish officialsdid noticeTrump’s screw-up.

These moves are not simply about abstract opposition to government; fully explaining them requires acknowledging U.S. history. Fromthe militarytothe United States Postal Serviceto sundry federal agencies, the federal government’s personnel policies — though nowhere near perfect — havehelped expand and sustain a Black middle class. The federal government’s personnel policies — though nowhere near perfect — have helped expand and sustain a Black middle class. The most well-known example of this shows up at your home every day: the U.S. Postal Service. The Post Office Department, as it used to be called, was oncethe single largest employer of Black peoplein the United States. In 2022, according to the Government Accountability Office, “about 53 percent of [the Postal Service’s] total workforceconsisted of individuals from historically disadvantaged racial or ethnic groups, and women made up about 46 percent of the workforce.” And it’s not just the post office. As the Center for American Progress pointed outin a 2020 report, “the federal government has hired Black Americans at higher rates than the private sector going back a century or more.” Not coincidentally, generations of conservatives — fromGeorge Wallaceto Donald Trump — have plotted torein in the federal government. Let’s be clear, then, why the federal government has bothered conservatives so much and for so long. And let’s be clear about the impacts reducing the federal workforce — either via the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” or by unleashinganti-DEI“patter rollers” — would have. Trump tying the hands of federal workers,essentially criminalizing the work they’ve been doing, or planning to lay them off will have disastrous consequences for Americans throughout the country. Millions outside the government will soon learn in the worst ways how much they’ve relied on the work federal employees do every day. But the devastation for the workers themselves cannot be forgotten. And we can expect extra hardship for Black communities. The federal workforce, though far from majority Black,is disproportionately Black. Thus, any policy aimed at firing federal workers en masse — even if it is not explicitly tied to Trump’s despicable anti-DEI obsession — would still disproportionately hurt Black people. This is not a bug in Trump’s program. It is a feature. This is not a bug in Trump’s program. It is a feature. Explaining why Black people have been drawn to federal jobs, Marcus Board, a Howard University political science professor, told Washington’s NBC affiliate, “They have worker protections, federal worker protections, that are guaranteed by the federal government, and soit’s one of the few placeswhere they can be sure that they’re going to be supported, protected and taken care of.” When a reporter said many people in and around Washington interpret attacks on the federal government as an attack on Black Americans, specifically the Black middle class, Board said, “I think that’s an accurate read.” Indeed. There’s no greater predictor ofa white backlashthanBlack success. But conservative animosity isn’t solely about who federal workers are; it’s also about the changes the federal government has forced conservative parts of the country to adopt. After the Civil War, the federal government imposed Reconstruction and — however briefly — protected newly freed Black people from the planter class that sought to essentially re-enslave them. Federal marshals held Ruby Bridges’ hand as she walked through a gantlet of angry white people to William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans and sent troops to escortthe Little Rock Nineinto that city’s Central High School. Federal officials and judges stopped numerous racist schemes that jurisdictions, particularly in the South, employed to suppress the Black vote. To accuse the federal government of overreach, then, is to oppose the progress the feds have helped usher in. To accuse the federal government of overreach is to oppose the progress the feds have helped usher in. In 1980, then-presidential candidateRonald Reagan told an audience at Mississippi’s Neshoba County Fair, “I believe that there are programs like that, programs like education and others, that should be turned back to the states and the local communities with the tax sources to fund them, and let the people—.” According to the newspaper that reported his speech, the applause drowned out the rest of Reagan’s sentence. “Programs like education,” Reagan said — in a state wherewhat minimal integrationthere was had only existed forabout 10 years. “I believe in states’ rights,” he said. The conservative project of getting rid of the Department of Educationwasn’t yet a year oldwhen Reagan gave that stump speech. The time of its founding is directly related to the department’s role in the enforcement of civil rights — and the broader animosity on the right at the very idea of public education afterthe Supreme Court prohibited racial segregation in public schools. Trumppromised during the 2024 campaign to get rid of the department altogether. It’s a goal of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 (whichTrump swore he had nothing to do with). The Heritage Foundation itself was co-founded by a conservative activist upset that the federal government told Bob Jones University it couldn’t maintain its nonprofit status andrefuse admission to Black students. The religious right would soon make fighting abortion its main cause,the evangelical writer and activist Lisa Sharon Harper has argued, but its raison d’être was defending segregation. It’s impossible to separate conservative animosity toward the federal government from conservatives’ history of opposing integration and Black progress. And Trump attacking the federal workforce as he rolls backcivil rights edictsand DEI initiatives means we don’t have to pretend they're unrelated.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows PresidentDonald Trumptook the unusual step Friday offiring 18 of the federal government’s 73 inspectors general. Those let go — from the departments of Defense, State, Labor, Health and Human Services, among other places — were told only that “changing priorities” led to their dismissal. Inspectors general, as they are called,are found all over Washington, D.C.,in a wide range of agencies and departments. They seldom make news, but they play an important role in blowing the whistle on instances of gross inefficiencies or unlawful behavior and by not being the servants of any political party. In short, as Creighton University law professorMichael Kelly writes,the inspector general is a “modern adaptation to achieving the checks and balances the Framers of our Constitution intended when they created the federal government.” So why would Trump go after them at the start of his second term? This is not the first time Trump has targeted inspectors general. Doing so, Kelly explains, “lays the groundwork for taking over that government from within.” As he puts it, “if the designated watchers aren’t watching, because they’ve been purged by the very abuse of power they were installed to prevent, then the way is open for more abuse and corruption to flow.” The mass firing also sends a clear message not just to remaining inspectors general, including those at the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, but also to the rest of the federal bureaucracy: Get with the program or you will be next. Downplaying the significance of the dismissals, thepresident told reportersthat firing IGs is “a very common thing to do.” “I don’t know them,” he told reporters, “But some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing their job. It’s a very standard thing to do.’” It’s true that this is not the first time Trump has targeted inspectors general. Late in his first term, hedismissedthe inspectors general of five Cabinet departments. But unlike this time, those firings took place over a six-week period. And mass firings are exceptionally rare. Upon taking office in 1981, Ronald Reagan removed all 15 inspectors general then serving, only to rehire about half of them later. Since then,no president has removed more than two IGs— except for Trump. Congresscreated the first inspector general position in 1976, in an era of post-Watergate reform. Two years later, it passed the Inspector General Act of 1978. That law said that inspectors general should lead “independent and objective units,” which would, among other things,  “conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations” of the departments and agencies in which they serve. And Congress made clear that these new officers did not just report to the executive branch. The law also required them to keep agency heads and Congress “fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies relating to the administration of… programs and operations and the necessity for and progress of corrective action.” Thirty years later, Congressamended the regulations around the IG role, requiring that a president “shall communicate in writing the reasons for any such removal or transfer [of an inspector general] to both Houses of Congress, not later than 30 days before the removal or transfer.” The constitutional precedents here are similarly clear-cut. As a 2021 Congressional Research Reportnotes, “the legislative history of the 2008 amendment suggests that the purpose of this change was to ‘allow for an appropriate dialogue with Congress in the event that the planned transfer or removal is viewed as an inappropriate or politically motivated attempt to terminate an effective Inspector General.’” In 2022, following Trump’s first term purge of IGs, Congressstrengthenedthat requirement by saying that the president had to provide a “substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons” before terminating an IG. The constitutional precedents here are similarly clear-cut. The Supreme Courthas long recognizedCongress’ exclusive authority “to create executive branch offices….and when necessary, design an office in a way that encourages operational independence from the political influence of the executive branch….” It alsohas made clearthat the president’s removal power is not “illimitable.” But neither clear statutes nor congressional authority or constitutional limits on the removal power seemed to matter to Trump or his allies. The president “has a right to get in there who he wants,” Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton argued — a more deferential approach thanhe has taken to Democratic presidents. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, who co-sponsored the 2008 amendment, nevertheless shrank from confronting Trump. “There may be good reason the IG were fired,” heinsisted. And according to The Associated Press, Sen. Lindsey Graham even admitted that Trump had not followed statutes. “Just tell them you need to follow the law next time,” Graham said. Such a casual attitude toward a president who ignores the law doesn’t augur well for what is to come. A letter to the president from House Democratswas anything but casual. “Your actions,” it said, “violate the law, attack our democracy, and undermine the safety of the American people….Firing inspectors general without due cause is antithetical to good government, undermines the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and degrades the federal government’s ability to function effectively and efficiently.” They were right. But maybe those reasons were precisely why Trump did what he did Friday night. Austin Sarat is the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Science at Amherst College.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows I had planned to spend my Thursday attending an all-day meeting reviewing research grant applications for the National Institutes of Health. The meeting was abruptly canceled Wednesday in a terse email from an NIH staff member; I soon heard from colleagues that all such committees, and other related meetings in the grant process that were scheduled for the remainder of January,were being canceled. Becausethere was no official statement about these cancellations, their intent, extent and duration are unclear. It is presumed to be part of the shutdown of various activitiesacross scientific agencies, includinghiring, travel and scientific communications at the NIH. Regardless of the reason, this is a potentially devastating event — not just for the scientific community, but for all Americans. To understand why, it’s important to explain a bit of the research funding and review cycle. To review grants for scientific merit, grant agencies bring together committees, or “study sections,” of around 25 to 30 people from different fields, with topical and methodological expertise of various kinds. These study sections are followed by advisory council meetings that ensure proposals are scientifically sound and align with the NIH’s priorities. The council meetings have apparently beencanceled as well, affecting proposals that had already cleared study sections’ review within the past few months. If this pause is not reversed soon, the fallout for scientific research in the U.S. may be felt for years to come. Without scientific review, a cycle of applications cannot move forward to the council meetings, and without councils’ recommendations, a cycle of proposals with high merit cannot move forward for funding at this time. If this pause is not reversed soon, the fallout for scientific research in the U.S. may be felt for years to come. Let’s say a researcher trains for many years to conduct a line of scientific inquiry, acquiring knowledge about the disease and about cutting-edge research methodologies, and then manages to secure a job at a university to do that research as faculty. In general, that job by itself will not provide sustained funds to pursue that research full time, no matter how necessary or lifesaving or successful the work is. For the most part, researchers must secure funds for their research through a competitive grant process. And the backbone of funding is from federal agencies. Research grants do not just pay for the material and technical resources to conduct the research project. They cover the salary and benefits of the researcher and the staff, which includes research coordinators, lab technicians, data analysts, biostatisticians and others, representing alarge, economy-boosting workforce across the country. They also “keep the lights on,” providing support for universities and other organizations that provide the infrastructure for the research and other, nonresearch activities. And they support trainees who work under an established researcher, generating the future research workforce. Because any given grant only supports a small portion of a researcher’s time for a few years, most must continuously pursue funding so that they and their teams can receive a full paycheck that doesn’t abruptly disappear when a grant ends. So by and large, scientists are not only doing the science, but serving as their own fundraisers, supporting the institution that has hired them, and helping fund the trainees whom they teach. The work of filing grant proposals is nearly invisible to the public, but represents a staggering amount of work and a skill set unto itself. A single grant proposal may take years to conceptualize; the preliminary studies leading up to a major grant proposal may be the result of decades of work. A fully assembled application is at least over 100 pages, including an explanation of its significance and novelty, its methods, the team assembled to perform the project, the research budget, the ethical conduct of research, and more. More complex, multicenter grants can be north of 400 pages. And researchers are in a continuous process of reworking prior grants that did not get funded and generating new grant submissions. Once submitted, the proposals typically go through a standardized review process that filters each application through the eyes of multiple experts to identify proposals that have high potential to have significant impact on our health. The process is a year-round, complexadministrative undertaking: At the NIH alone, it engages tens of thousands of reviewers annually in more than 1,000 meetings with study sections like the one I should have been sitting in Thursday. I’ve never heard of mass cancellations like those that occurred this week. In a standard process at the NIH (where most of my grants have been submitted and review work has been), a given session may be assigned as many as 100 grants or more. Each reviewer may be assigned eight to 10 grants and spend upward of 50 hours reading applications and submitting their critique prior to the meeting. Because so many reviewers have research-related positions that keep them very busy outside these sections, and some meetings require travel and lodging arrangements, scheduling these sections occurs well in advance. And for just a single study section, federal staff prep for months to ensure submitted grants are complete, assign them to review committees with the appropriate focus and expertise, and contend with myriad logistical issues. I’ve never heard of mass cancellations like those that occurred this week, so I don’t have a good mental model for what happens next, but rescheduling and restarting the whole process described above will be challenging, to say the least, particularly in the context of any hiring freezes or personnel reductions. The cost of delays is hard to overstate. Mary-Claire King, an award-winning cancer researcher,once shared a storyabout how she almost didn’t make it to the NIH to secure an initial grant for what eventually became a lifesaving therapy for breast cancer. While parts of her story are extraordinary (like a run-in with baseball legend Joe DiMaggio), it underscores the fact that careers in research can be incredibly fragile. One well-timed grant can seed a line of sustained inquiry that leads to something meaningful for the health and longevity of Americans; a missed grant can delay or derail that work. A single grant can ensure that whole research teams that have taken years to build can stay together and sustain their work. For those early in their careers, even a small, short-term grant at the right moment can serve as a critical fork in the road to a research-track career. Why do these changes in trajectory, even a single skipped research cycle, matter? There are lives on the other end. Practices in medicine unimaginable a generation ago are now routine because the research machine marches on, cycle after cycle. The colleagues I’ve heard from this week have dedicated themselves to improving and saving lives. Studying novel cancer therapies. Improving the management of childhood asthma. Understanding factors that make diabetes difficult to manage. Slowing the course of Alzheimer’s. Across my research communities, the overwhelming sentiment is concern about the impact on bodies of science, current and future, on being able to help people and sustain ongoing improvements in quality of life and lifespan. “My research helps a lot of people,” a research colleague, who is a cancer geneticist at a top-10 research institution, wrote to me Wednesday. “However, I am not yet tenured faculty, meaning that I won’t get to keep my job as a physician scientist in a couple of years if I don’t get an NIH grant. Period. It is terrifying, devastating, to think it could all just disintegrate so quickly.” For people everywhere living with a disease that does not yet have an effective therapy, it’s likely that somewhere in this cycle of deferred research, there is someone who cares about that disease, knows that you cannot wait for the solutions, and has been working night and day to chip away at the answers for you. If this week’s shutdown is any indication of our government’s approach to science, those answers may remain lost for longer than they should.

On Friday, the justicessaid that they would consider a bidfor the country’s first publicly funded religious charter school, in Oklahoma. A week earlier, the court hadsaid that it would hear an appealfrom Maryland parents seeking the right to keep their children from reading LGBTQ-themed books. In both cases, religious groups successfully petitioned the justices despite warnings that crediting their legal claims would break new ground. To be sure, the court has already favored First Amendment religious argumentsin recent years. Doing so in these new cases wouldn’t be a new phenomenon. The question is how much further the court might go in this area. To be sure, the court has already favored First Amendment religious arguments in recent years. In the Oklahoma case,the petitionfrom lawyers with theAlliance Defending Freedomcited recent high court rulings bolstering First Amendment claims of free exercise of religion. Opposing their petition, the state’s Republican attorney general distinguished those rulings bywriting thatthey were about “state subsidization of tuition at existing private religious schools, not state establishment of new public religious schools.” Responding to the Supreme Court’s taking of the Oklahoma case, the American Civil Liberties Union and otherssaid in a statement: “Converting public schools into Sunday schools would be a dangerous sea change for our democracy.” Notably, JusticeAmy Coney Barrettrecused herself from the case. Theordergranting reviewdidn’t explainwhy the court will be without the Trump appointee, who has beenin the majorityin divided religion rulings. But if the case is headed for another partisan split on the court with six Republican appointees and three Democratic appointees, the rest of the majority may have figured it can afford to lose one vote. It takes four justices to grant review. The court has a full set of justices for the Maryland case, Mahmoud v. Taylor. Citing similar First Amendment precedents, parents of elementary school studentssay their rights are burdenedthrough their children’s forced participation in certain instruction on gender and sexuality without parental notice or the chance to opt out. School officials, meanwhile,say that the parentsare trying to “unsettle a decades-old consensus that parents who choose to send their children to public school are not deprived of their right to freely exercise their religion simply because their children are exposed to curricular materials the parents find offensive.” Of course,the Dobbs caseand other recent appeals have shown that a majority of the court can change how the law is interpreted if it chooses to.

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows It has been one week sincePresident Donald Trumpwas sworn in for the second time. The past seven days have been, at best, disorienting, as the new administration has jackknifed the country to the right so fast that the centrifugal force already feels crushing. In that time, Trump acted on his promise to unleasha wave of executive actionsto begin transforming the federal government in his image. After Trump’s win over then-Vice President Kamala Harris, many of the people I know felt numb or checked out, unable to contemplate what was coming. I told anyone who would listen that that feeling would change once the theoretical became practical and all the hypotheticals under discussion emerged into our new daily realty. A great wave of Americans have now checked back in at once — and the net effect is straining our collective mental capacity. Beyond the policy shifts, though, the overall feeling of Trump’s ascension is different this time. So far, Trump haspardoned or commuted the sentencesof nearly every Jan. 6 rioter, including those who assaulted the Capitol Police. He has launched the first salvo in his quest toend birthright citizenshipas guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. He has rushed tocut off immigration optionsfor people who have been — as Republicans so often put it — waiting in line for their turn, and he has moved toenact mass deportations of those already here legally. His administration hasthreatened federal workers who work to improve diversity, issued a freeze onthe Justice Department’s civil rights investigations, paused wide swaths ofcritical health researchand commanded state and local officials tocooperate with his anti-immigrant sweeps or face prosecution. Beyond the policy shifts, though, the overallfeelingof Trump’s ascension is different this time. When he won in 2016, it was a surprise for virtually the entire country,the newly elected president included. Eight years ago, the narrow Electoral College win by this garish figure was seen as a likely fluke; the country’s economic anxiety had prompted a regretful mistake in selecting Trump (and let’s not forget, there was clear evidence of foreign interference). With the proverbial adrenaline pumping on the left, the backlash from the millions who hadn’t voted for him was immediate. The stumbles in his administration’s early days made his time as a national force feel like a frightening, but ultimately temporary, stumbling block in the nation’s progress. This time it wasimpossible not to see what was comingin the event of a Trump win. The investigations and court cases surrounding his final days in office had laid bare his willingness to discard the Constitution in favor of retaining power. The Heritage Foundation’sProject 2025was there for anyone to read, no matter how many denials and disavowals the campaign issued. After years of seeing Trump in office and out, even asthe haze of nostalgiasettled over Americans’ collective memory, there was no pretense about his being “a changed man.” If anything, Trumpleaned into being himself, to the delight of his supporters. If his first win felt like being sucker punched rounding a corner, the second feels like havingseen the threat comingfrom a mile away and been powerless to avoid it. As a result, the country has shifted to accommodate his depredations this time around. “Trump’s cultural victory has lapped his political victory,”The New York Times’ Ezra Klein wrote recently, noting how the narrowness of the president’s victory over Harris doesn’t correlate to the deeper resentments it ostensibly tapped. “The election was close, but the vibes have been a rout. ... In 2016, Trump felt like an emissary of the past; in 2025, he’s being greeted as a harbinger of the future.” That’s correct, but the “future” on offer is one of maximum regression to a darker past. It is incumbent on his opponents not to let the present cacophony overwhelm their sense of purpose or focus. The depth of the shift hit hardest for me in a quote from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt aboutTrump’s executive order on gender, which will affect trans and nonbinary Americans’ passports. “They can still apply to renew their passport — they just have to use their God-given sex, which was decided at birth,” Leavitt toldNOTUS’ Oriana González. It was Leavitt’s use of “God-given sex” that threw me. Here was the chief spokesperson for the White House padding officially sanctioned bigotry with a religious justification. More concerning was the callousness with which she tossed it off, confident that it wouldn’t drive headlines or prompt any consequences for her. This last week’sflurry of actionhas been an extended flex of the MAGA movement’s newfound sense of dominance. Several people havecompared the blitzkrieg underwayto the “shock and awe” campaign launched against Iraq at the onset of the U.S. invasion in 2003. (We’re unfortunately seeing today’s elected Democrats showing a similar instinct to follow the tide, fearing further electoral losses instead of standing up for what is right.) What begins now, though, is the administration’s long, hard slog to make these changes stick as part of its campaign of domestic nation-building. MAGA can only succeed by convincing enough of the populace that the changes Trump is making are inevitable and everlasting. Thefirst 100 days of an administrationare about notching easy wins and deciding which tougher pushes to spend political capital on. But Trump is,as ever,burning through a pile of creditthat far exceeds the collateral behind it. It’s a gambit that requires convincing anyone with the ability to push back on him that it won’t be worth checking his balance sheets. The sheer scope at which he is trying to act at once is a strategy designed for a sprint, not a marathon, in hopes of accomplishing as much as possible before anyone catches on that he’s spending beyond his political means. It is incumbent on his opponents not to let the present cacophony overwhelm their sense of purpose or focus. It may take longer to overcome the inertia many are feeling with the crashing down of that wave we all saw coming, to marshal enough resistance to reach critical mass. In the meantime, there arelegal challenges being filedto counter Trump’s unlawfulness andmutual aid is being organizedin communities across America. The fate of our country will not be decided in the span of a week. The biggest threat is mistaking the scale of this opening salvo for anything more than the opening of a much longer struggle.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows With the stroke of a pen late Monday, freshly inauguratedPresident Donald Trumptook trans rights back more than a decade bysigning an executive orderthat, in essence, commands federal government agencies to stop recognizing the existence oftrans people. Theexecutive order, titled “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” orders government officials to treat sex as “biological” and “determined at conception.” It specifically says imprisoned trans women are to be held in men’s prisons and that federal single-gender spaces are to be used according to so-called “biological sex.” And perhaps most importantly to working class trans people in the U.S., Trump ordered the State Department to ban the practice of assigning X as a gender marker on U.S. passports and barred gender marker changes going forward on passports and all federal identification. The message feels unimaginably cruel: Trump and his supporters want me and my fellow trans community to detransition, to retreat back in the closet out of fear. On Tuesday, the White House clarified that the passport rules do not apply to previously issued passports, but, if a trans person seeks to renew their passport, they would have to return to the gender marker of their birth.NBC News reporteda warning from experts for trans people and those with an X (usually used by nonbinary people who don’t want to be identified as either male or female) on their passport, saying that such international travelers could potentially be detained until a new passport with their assigned sex at birth can be re-issued. If true, that process could take weeks and presumably trans women in this situation would be detained with men and trans men with women, given other references in the order. It is the most widespread government intrusion into the private lives of trans people since gay sex was legalized in 2003 in theLawrence v. Texas Supreme Court decision. While most trans people rightfully panicked over the new passport rules, it’s important to tell the whole story of the executive order, which extends further than travel documentation. Housing trans prisoners with menresults in horrific rates of prison rape. There’splenty of studyandevidenceof this. The reason that trans women started being housed with other women is because courts determined that it was cruel and unusual punishment to subject a specific minority torampant prison rape. That risk now extends to trans travelers who might be detained trying to re-enter the country. The order also opens federal employees who are trans to widespread discrimination. Trump is sending an early signal that trans people have no place in  the America he is trying to build over the next four years. It is not the government of reasonable people with a handful of concerns that the trans rights movement maybe went a little too far. It’s arguably genocidal, according to the official definition of genocide. This is not about trans athletes, this is not about transition care for minors, we’re looking at a future where trans Americans are detained by their own government just trying to come home from overseas. Are you not outraged by this? I woke up this week as officially a second-class citizen, simply because I exist in a way that the party in power does not believe should be allowed. The message feels unimaginably cruel: Trump and his supporters want me and my fellow trans community to detransition, to retreat back in the closet out of fear. This executive order has made my practical life even more difficult in ways that I anticipate I’ll keep discovering in the coming years. But, Mr. President, I am not going back and I am not afraid.

Chicago Public Schools initially put out a public statement that identifiedtwo federal agents who went to Hamline Elementary School as officers from ICE, which earlier this week wasgiven the green lightto make arrests at schools, places of worships, hospitals and other “sensitive” locations in a reversal of a long-standing policy. The agents, however, were Secret Service personnel “investigating a threat to one of our protectees in reference to the recent TikTok ban,” the agency said in a statement. The agents identified themselves to the school principal and left without incident, the agency said, adding that it does not “investigate nor enforce immigration laws.” The agents were not granted entry to the school. CPS said its officials “followed the established protocols to ensure student safety” and contacted Chicago Public Schools’ Law Department and Office of Safety and Security. “While this was a misunderstanding in terms of the specific branch of DHS, the school’s response demonstrates that our system, in partnership with community organizations, is prepared and ready to keep our students and staff safe,” the school district said. In apost on X, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson cautioned against sharing unverified rumors, writing, “While people across the city are worried about heightened immigration enforcement, it is imperative that individuals not spread unverified information that sparks fear.” The incident is reflective of theclimate of fearpermeating communities acrossthe country as Trump readies federal authorities to carry out hisplans for mass deportations. Since Trump took office, ICE has begun announcing on social media the number of daily arrests it says it has carried out. The agency has also conducted immigration raids in several cities that havereportedly ensnared U.S. citizensas well. More than 90% of students at Hamline Elementary are Hispanic,according to public school data.The Washington Postinterviewed a 10-year-old girl who recalled hiding in a classroom as the principal ordered a lockdown over the loudspeakers during the incident. “Everyone was so scared,” the 10-year-old, who was granted anonymity to protect her safety, told the Post, “because we didn’t know if it was a shooter or the immigration police.” Clarissa-Jan Lim is a breaking/trending news blogger for MSNBC Digital.

Biggs, aJan. 6 proponentand member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, made the announcement at an Arizona Republican Party event,telling the crowd: “I am jumping in formally. It is now time to Make Arizona Great Again.” Biggs, whohelped Trumpin his attempt to overturn the 2020 election,toldthe conservative outletNewsmaxin an interview on Sunday that Arizona should be “the reddest state in the country.” His election would certainly be a step toward claiming that title. Biggs is alleged to have beena key playerin the deliberations among MAGA activists, Trump administration officials and far-right lawmakers who devised schemes for overturning Trump’s 2020 election. After the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, for example, far-right activist Ali Alexander — who organized the “stop the steal” rally that preceded the riot —has said Biggs was one of the lawmakers who helped himcook up that day’s plan to exert “maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting” to certify Joe Biden’s election victory, though Biggs hasn’t been accused of coordinating or promoting the violent attack on the Capitol. (Biggs has denied helping Alexander organize the Jan. 6 rally.)

The representative celebrated Trump’s blanket pardon for Jan. 6 criminals, evengreeting some of the recently released inmatesand their supporters at a Washington, D.C., jail last week.

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows ByJordan Rubin How far does Donald Trump’sblanket clemencyforJan. 6 defendantsgo? The seemingly philosophical question has immediate legal consequences, raised not only by the sheer number of people pardoned but also by the diversity of some of their criminal conduct extending beyond the confines of the Capitol that day. Take the case of Dan Edwin Wilson. The Jan. 6 defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer, as well as to firearm-related charges resulting from a search of his Kentucky home. He was sentenced by a Trump-appointed judge, Dabney Friedrich, to five years in prison on both sets of charges to run concurrently (meaning running together, not consecutively). The Justice Department hadrecommended a five-year term. Then came Trump’s clemency order last week, whichgranted pardonsfor people “convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” Wilson was then released from the federal Bureau of Prisons. But according to a court filing from his lawyer on Sunday, the BOP wants him back. “Whether he was, in fact, pardoned of both sets of offenses has yet to be litigated,” his lawyer Norman Pattiswrote in seeking a court orderhalting any incarceration effort while the issue is litigated. The lawyer also wrote: “Although the firearms charges arose from evidence seized in a search of Mr. Wilson’s home, that search warrant was issued to seek evidence of his participation in the Capitol riot. It pre-dated his arrest on riot-related charges.” The question this raises is whether the firearm charges are “related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” Getting back to the text of Trump’s order, the question this raises is whether the firearm charges are “related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.” How the courts answer the question depends on how broadly they see the events as being “related.” As his lawyer frames the matter, the firearm charges are related in the sense that they stemmed from a search for Jan. 6-related evidence. Yet, how far does the “related” connection extend? One can think of examples that push the notion beyond the breaking point. To take an extreme hypothetical, what if law enforcement had found a dead body in Wilson’s home while searching for Jan. 6-related evidence? Would a pardon cover any federal charges he might face related to the body in that hypothetical scenario? Now, in typical litigation, an argument that one side raises would face adversarial testing by an opposing party. But here, the federal government under Trump is broadly on the defendants’ side. And if the courts push back against the defense argument and Trump doesn’t like that, then he’s free to issue a separate pardon to cover any firearm-related charges. In fact, if the president wants to ensure that none of his supporters face any further legal consequences (at least at the federal level, where he has clemency power), then he could issue another blanket pardon for any federal crimes whatsoever over a specific period of time, on top of the blanket Jan. 6 clemency. He could keep pardoning them until he leaves office for any and all federal crimes he chooses. So it’s unclear at the moment to what extent these novel questions will be answered in court. On Monday, Judge Friedrich ordered the government to respond by Tuesday. So first we’ll see if the new DOJ believes the conduct is covered by the pardon — and what the judge does in response.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows We’ve been having the wrong conversation about aging in America. Let me be clear. It’s not that we’ve completely avoided the topic. During an election that pitted two ofthe oldest presidential candidates in American historyagainst each other, and especially afterPresident Joe Biden’s calamitous debate performance, we spent a lot of time jawing about the age and capabilities of our political leaders. But that focus on the candidates’ elder status distracts us from a seismic issue that should really merit our attention: the historic surge in Americans who will be turning 65 over the next five years. Over the past decade, a steady cadence of10,000 people a day were turning 65. By the end of 2025, close to 12,000 people a day will turn 65 for the next two years. In 2024, that daily number jumped tomore than 11,200.By the end of 2025, close to 12,000 people a day will turn 65 for the next two years,according to the U.S. census, as the U.S. enters what demographers call the “Peak 65 period,” when all those baby boomers march into their senior years. The U.S. population is older at this moment than it has ever been,according to the Population Reference Bureau, and the number of Americans age 65 or older will increase by a whopping 47% by 2050. At that point, the tally of 82 million older adults will represent 23% of the U.S. population,according to the PRB. We are looking at what is reportedly the largest leap in retirement eligibility that America has ever seen, and it is happening at a moment when the gaps in our retirement system are impossible to ignore. Because all those silver-haired boomers don’t have the pensions or the savings that previous generations could count on, the massive cohort of aging Americans represents a tidal wave that will rock almost every aspect of our economy. AARP calls this demographic trend the “Silver Tsunami.” Other financial forecasters have used a different metaphor, likening the trend to a massive iceberg that the ship of state can’t maneuver around. One in five Americans over age 50 have no retirement savings according to AARP, and 61% are worried they won’t have enough socked away to live on in their senior years.For 1 in every 3 Americans,credit card debt outpaces their emergency savings, and more than 1 in 4 people have no emergency savings at all. And those savings may have to stretch over more years because the average life expectancy is increasing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vital statistics surveillance report projects thata man turning 65 this year is expected to live to age 84on average while an average 65-year-old woman is expected to live to 86. Because Americans are living longer, many of those boomers will remain in the workforce longer, but forecasters worry that those extra years on the job won’t translate into extra retirement savings. I am going to keep an eye on this demographic trend and return to this issue in coming months because it will touch almost every aspect of our economy and American life in general. As I talk with local government officials about the so-called Silver Tsunami, it becomes clear that cities and counties are quietly bracing themselves for an epidemic ofevictions,povertyand evenhomelessnessamong the elderly, many of whom are divorced, single or living far away from relatives or a reliable support system because families now tend to be more spread out geographically. Some states are taking a proactive approach. California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Texas and Colorado all have multisector master plans on aging that help the state and its residents prepare for housing, health, caregiving and affordability. Nine other states are developing such master plans. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pledged that cuts to Medicare and Social Securitywill not be includedin the legislative package intended to fund Trump’s agenda. With a slim majority, Johnson knows those cuts would be a nonstarter because no Democrat would be on board with slashing those programs. But even a status quo approach to elder retirement programs may not be enough to stave off disaster with such a large number of seniors with staggering needs. And in his first days in office,Trump has already signed executive ordersthat reverse Biden-era executive orders on health care, including the effort to limit the cost of prescription drugs for those on Medicaid or Medicare. For a president who is so focused on projecting strength and virility, will Trump lead the discussion this nation needs to have on the Silver Tsunami? Perhaps, but probably not. It is indeed a blessing for anyone fortunate to live well beyond six decades and also a blessing for the people in their orbits who benefit from their wisdom, their attention and their companionship. Yet when so many people are entering that chapter all at once, shouldn’t we be paying more attention to how we can enhance the gift of long life with planning and preparation? Loved ones are often the first line of response when seniors need help with bathing, toileting, dressing or preparing meals, but as the needs grow, families may need to turn to outside help or long-term care, which a report from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation foundcan cost $60,000 a year or more. Shouldn’t we be paying more attention to how we can enhance the gift of long life with planning and preparation? That same report found thatfewer than half of adultshad ever had a serious conversation with their loved ones about who would take care of them if they became incapacitated. This is a good time for families to create their own master plans and assess how well prepared (or not) elders are for their later years. As noted above, states are bracing for this massive wave of elderly residents. Families might also want to seriously consider the impact on their finances, housing and ability to juggle caring for someone with great needs, while also keeping up with work and other responsibilities. During last year’s presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris laid out a proposal forexpanding Medicare to cover the cost of home-based long-term careand adjusting the spend-down requirements for Medicaid that can pull some recipients and their loved ones close to poverty before they qualify for services. It is unlikely that the Trump team would take up Harris’ specific proposal to reduce the price tag for long-term care. But because voters cited economic concerns as one of the reasons for voting for him, he would be wise to direct his administration to focus on easing the cost of aging in America. If you thinkthe price of eggsis high, just look at the monthly cost for in-home health care or rent at a housing complex for seniors. Overall, addressing this issue bumps up against a grim irony in politics, especially in a year where there has been a critical and you might even say withering focus on elder leaders in both parties who are thought to have stayed in their positions decades beyond the typical retirement age. That “how old is too old” political flashpoint means that some of the very officials who should be leading this discussion about the “gray wave” may be disinclined to draw attention to their own advanced age. I hope that changes, because American needs strong leadership on this issue. If not, the decision to ignore it won’t age well.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Delivering on the pledge he made to the Libertarian Party at itsconvention last summer, President Donald Trump on Tuesdaypardoned Ross Ulbricht, a former Eagle Scout and computer whiz who in 2011 created Silk Road, which became a huge global online market for illicit drugs. Likeother presidential pardonsof the past few weeks, Trump’s decision to free Ulbricht after nearly 12 years of incarceration hasdivided the public. So who has the better argument — the “Free Ross” libertarians or the “Let Him Rot in Prison” posse? That depends in large measure on how one assesses several key features of his case and the criminal justice system. Who has the better argument — the ‘Free Ross’ libertarians or the ‘Let Him Rot in Prison’ posse? Start with the conduct for which Ulbricht was convicted: abetting the distribution of narcotics, conspiracy to aid and abet computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic in fake IDs, conspiracy to launder money and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. Those charges certainly sound serious, even sinister, but they all arose out of his creation of an online marketplace where willing sellers and buyers could anonymously exchange payment for products, including illegal ones. Libertarians point to the fact that such marketplaces arise from the enforcement of paternalistic laws that make it a crime for people to buy, sell and consume substances that others don’t think they should put in their bodies. Most libertarians also believe that — as with smoking and the consumption of alcohol (which togetherkillmore than half a million peopleper year) — a person’s decision to consume illicit substances is a personal one that is properly none of the government’s business. And if someone creates an online marketplace where drug sales can be done more safely than on the street — which is precisely what Silk Road provided — then that should be none of the government’s business either. But wait, say Ulbricht’s vociferous critics — he didn’t just create Amazon Prime for drugs; he engaged in other, more culpable behavior, including soliciting murder for hire. As it happens, the government did accuse Ulbricht of paying to have several people killed, including some he suspected of embezzling money from him. But prosecutors chose not to include any of those charges in the case that went trial, so the jury never heard the government’s evidence or saw it tested in open court. Instead,the trial judge determined by a mere preponderance of the evidencethat Ulbricht had in fact solicited murder for hire and factored that into her rubble-bouncing sentence of two life terms, plus 40 years in prison. So much for the concept of innocent untilprovenguilty according to constitutionally established procedures. Moreover, there is ample reason to be suspicious both of the prosecution’s tactics and the integrity of its investigation, given thatat least two federal agents stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin from Ulbrichtwhile working undercover to help take him down. Those agents, Carl Force of the Drug Enforcement Administration and Shaun Bridges of the Secret Service, betrayed the public trust and sought to profit from their official positions. Upon conviction,they received 78 and 71 months, respectively — a tiny fraction of Ulbricht’s sentence and about half the time he actually served before being pardoned. Did Ulbricht deserve to have the slate wiped completely clean by a full presidential pardon instead of a commutation that would have left his conviction in place but sprung him from prison? Perhaps not. But is it justice for him to grow old and die in prison while sticky-fingered federal agents who corrupted the investigation and disgraced their badges walk free after serving their vastly less punitive sentences? Emphatically not. Clark Neily is senior vice president for legal studies at the Cato Institute.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows PresidentDonald Trump’s reputation as amaster of gaslightingis well deserved. And his contention that he’s a staunch defender of law enforcement might be the most maddening of all his falsehoods. Sure, he invented abig lieabout a massive conspiracy to steal the 2020 election that’s poisoned the brains of tens of millions of Americans and irreversibly damaged the integrity of the United States’ body politic. But it’s equally risible to profess that “I am a friend of police, more than any president who’s ever been in this office” shortly after pardoning or commuting the sentences of nearly everyone involved with theJan. 6 assault on the Capitol. Trump’s contention that he’s a staunch defender of law enforcement might be the most maddening of all his falsehoods. Those granted clemency by this self-proclaimed champion of law and order included the ringleaders of the attempted insurrection, rioters carrying (or wearing) Nazi andConfederate regaliaand chanting their intentions to murder then-Vice PresidentMike Penceand then-House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, as well as violent criminals whosavagely attacked police officers for hours. The phrase “Back the Blue” has long been used as a cudgel against anyone who dares criticize law enforcement officers and institutions. In this binary, you either unequivocally support cops or you’re a woke antifa terrorist. Until Trump pardoned the Jan. 6 rioters, “Back the Blue” was at its most absurd during the brief period earlier this decade when modest attempts at police reform were attempted (and mostly failed thanks in large part topolice union intransigence). In response, several states passed laws declaring police officers to be a protected identity group. This led, predictably, to ridiculously overbroad enforcement — like when a 19-year-old in 2021 wascharged with hate crime-enhancedcriminal mischief and disorderly conduct for allegedly destroying a “Blue Lives Matter” sign and for what the cop described as “smirking in an intimidating manner.” Now that Trump has escaped prosecution for attempting a self-coup, one would think he would have at least limited his blanket pardons to “nonviolent” rioters, if only out of respect for the thin blue line. In fact, he had even indicated the pardons would be carefully vetted and rioters who attacked cops might not be granted a presidential pass. But in the end, Trumpreportedly justimpulsively released them all with a one-page declaration, surprisingeven his own vice president. Among the convicted criminals whom Trump referred to as “hostages” unjustly arrested for their actions on a “day of love” is Ryan Nichols.NBC News reportedon the video evidence implicating Nichols: “Ryan Nichols said it, if you voted for f---ing treason we’re going to drag your f---ing a-- through the streets,” he said in the video as he marched to the Capitol. After he was seen on video spraying a giant canister of a chemical weapon at officers inside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel, Nichols bragged about his conduct on Facebook and called for more violence. “So if you want to know where Ryan Nichols stands, Ryan Nichols stands for violence,”he saidin a video cited by prosecutors. Pretty unambiguous stuff! And he’s hardly an outlier. Also according to NBC News, Daniel Rodriguez “used a stun gun and plunged it into the neck of Washington Police Officer Michael Fanone multiple times.” Prosecutors said David Dempsey used “his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on.” Andrew Taake had been sentenced to six years for “assaulting law enforcement officers with bear spray and a metal whip.” I could go on, with hundreds more names of violent Jan. 6 rioters and the crimes they committed, for which they have now been pardoned. One of the more recognizable rioters is Jacob Chansley — also known as the shirtless, horns-wearing “QAnon Shaman” — who boasted on X about buying “SOME MOTHA F***IN GUNS!!!” Four officers at the Capitol that day have since died by suicide, which are considered deaths in the line of duty. Sounds ominous! (Trump, a convicted felon, stillcannot legally possess firearms, per federal law.) TheFraternal Order of Police, the country’s largest police union and enthusiastic endorsers of Trump’s campaign, issued a vague and feeble message of disappointment — but not condemnation — of Trump’s pardons. Meanwhile, four officers at the Capitol that day have sincedied by suicide, which are considered deaths in the line of duty. More officers attacked that day continue to suffer from post-traumatic stress. Now they have to deal with both the indignity of watching their attackers walk free and the fear that the same people Trump incited to attack the Capitol will now take their retribution on the officers or their families. One former officer, Aquilino Gonell, posted on X, “The law and order dude is about to pardon those who assaulted the police. Collectively more than 40 rioters attacked me that day.” Among the top comments in response are a right-wing podcaster asking, “How many J6ers did you and your homies pepper spray and shoot rubber bullets at first?” and a pair of MAGA influencers with millions of followers saying, “You should be in prison bruh.” Another former officer, Michael Fanone, previously testified that he had been “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country” and earlier this month told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “My family, my children, and myself are less safe today because of Donald Trump and his supporters.” And that wasbeforethe pardons. Still another officer, Daniel Hodges, remains on active duty with the Metropolitan Police and worked to protect Trump on his second Inauguration Day. He testified to the House Jan. 6 committee: “To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin-blue-line flag — the symbol of support for law enforcement — more than once being carried by the terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us.” To be sure, Trump’s pardon-palooza didn’t completely leave out the cops. Some of Trump’s pardon giftees were law enforcement officers themselves, and they’re now free to rejoin those ranks. Also,Trump pardoned two officersin Washington, D.C., who were convicted of second-degree murder, conspiracy to obstruct, and obstruction of justice. So it’s not like he doesn’t completely “Back the Blue.” Trump and his supporters often refer to his 1.5 percentage-point victory in the 2024 popular vote as a mandate.Recent pollshave shownroughly 60% of Americansoppose pardoning Jan. 6 rioters — a much larger mandate! Andthough a handful of Republicans in Congressexpressed disapproval of the pardons, most eitherbacked pardons for those who attacked the blue, or cravenly stayed silent. Though Trump’s apologists dismiss the violence on Jan. 6 as an episode of brief and unfortunate unrest, I find it difficult to imagine that had the mob reached Mike Pence or Nancy Pelosi, or any member of Congress, they would’ve merely stopped their rage march and civilly expressed grievances about the 2020 election. These were violent people caught up in a mob hell-bent on finding an outlet for their rage. And if not for thequick thinkingof a rank-and-file Capitol cop, that mob likely would have found at least some of their targets. We could be talking today about the violence they committed when they got their hands on Pence and Pelosi, in addition to a few hundred police officers. Today, these would-be assassins and insurrectionists who nearly killed cops (and in many cases, openly bragged about it on the internet) are free to live their lives, to own guns and to run for elected office. Trump has even indicated he’s “open” tohosting some of the rioters at the White House, adding, “What they didis they were protesting a crooked election. People understand that also. And they were treated very badly.” The cops they attacked, meanwhile, are sentenced by Trump to live in fear. Anthony L. Fisher is a senior editor and writer for MSNBC Daily.

Earlier this month, Iwroteabout some of these Republicans, including far-right influencer Charlie Kirk, who said the funds should be contingent on California firing Kristin Crowley, Los Angeles’ first female and openly gay fire chief. And President Donald Trump has blamed the fires on California’s water distribution policy, thoughexperts have pushed backon such claims. That hasn’t stopped him from demanding that California officials change their water policy. Over the weekend, Trump added to his apparent list of conditions for California to receive federal fire aid, telling reporters on Friday that the state should impose a voting law thatmany legal experts say is voter suppression. “In California, I have a condition,” he said during a news conference while visiting hurricane-affected areas of North Carolina. “In California, we want them to have voter ID so the people have a voice, because right now the people don’t have a voice, because you don’t know who’s voting and it’s very corrupt.” There’s no evidence California’s voting system is corrupt or rife with voter fraud. As Gov. Gavin Newsom’s officeposted to Xon Friday: “Under current CA law you must be a CA resident and US citizen (and attest to being one under penalty of perjury) AND provide a form of ID such as driver’s license or passport that has been approved by the Secretary of State in order to register to vote.” Trump’s proposed remedy to fix this nonexistent problem of widespread voter fraud, enhanced “voter ID,”  is conservative parlance for policies that experts and activists often warndisproportionately harm nonwhite voters and other marginalized groups for various reasons. Trump’s ultimatum is all the more disturbing when you consider that the town of Altadena, which hasa significant Black population, was severely hurt by the wildfires in California. Now he’s suggesting making their recovery contingent on California accepting policies that could make it harder for some of those people to vote. So here, we have a scenario that feels similar to what led toTrump’s first impeachment for requesting a political favorin exchange for congressionally authorized aid to Ukraine. (The GOP-controlled Senate ultimately voted to acquit him.) In California’s case, Trump is being more explicit in demanding political concessions in exchange for vital aid. And he’s not threatening to withhold aid Congress has already authorized. He’s getting out in front of the negotiations entirely. On that note, shoutout to U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who looked Trump in the eye during a meeting last Friday and warned that his cruel ultimatum could easily come back to hurt Republicans if a Democrat regains the White House and decides to use similar tactics against conservative-led states.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows I was eight months pregnant with my second child — a boy — whenChristine Blasey Fordsat in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and bravely recalled the trauma she claimed she endured at the hands of soon-to-be Supreme Court JusticeBrett Kavanaugh. My son was kicking my ribs as I fought back tears while Ford testified that the laughter from the man who allegedly sexually assaulted her was “indelible in the hippocampus.” “The details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget,” she said, her voice shaking at times. “They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.” Despite accusations of sexual assault and domestic violence, yet another man has been buoyed by lawmakers and members of Congress to occupy one of the highest offices of federal government. Six years later, asPete Hegsethisconfirmed as President Donald Trump's next defense secretary, those details are haunting my memory, too. Because despiteaccusations of sexual assaultanddomestic violence, yet another man has been buoyed by lawmakers and members of Congress to occupy one of the highest offices of federal government — seemingly unscathed,confident and with an all-too-familiar smirk. The allegations levied against the former Fox News host have so far apparently beenfar from disqualifying. In 2017, Hegseth was investigated for sexual assault by California authorities after a woman accused him of raping her at a Monterey hotel. The woman,  referred to in the case as Jane Doe,claimedHegseth “blocked the door” to the hotel room “with his body” and, according to a police report from the Monterey California Police Department, she “remembered saying ‘no’ a lot.” She later went to the hospital because she believed she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth.According to authorities, she underwent a rape kit and had contusions on her right thigh. Hegseth has repeatedly denied the allegations, and in 2018 Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni declined to pursue the case after determining that “no charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” Hegsethlater paid the woman a $50,000 settlement, according to written answers he provided to Sen. Elizabeth Warren during the vetting process for his slated role as defense secretary. Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, confirmed a settlement payment had been made but declined to confirm the amount. During his confirmation hearing, Hegseth described the allegations as a “coordinated smear campaign,” arguing that he is innocent but “not a perfect person.” “But redemption is real,” Hegseth continued, adding that he has been “saved by the grace of God” and his current wife, Jennifer Rauchet. Like Kavanaugh, who claimed he was thevictim of a “political hit” orchestratedby a “frenzy on the left,”Hegseth has tended to blame“left-wing media”for turning him into a victim of a “smear campaign” orchestrated by“anonymous sources.” And like Kavanaugh — for whomTrump’s first administration reportedly heavily controlled the FBI investigation into Ford’s allegations— the soon-to-be secretary of defense appears to be sailing through a contentious confirmation hearing despite anFBI background check and investigationthat Democratic Sen. Jack Reed has said was “insufficient.” We are once again watching a sitting president of the United States — who himself has faced (and denied) many allegations of sexual misconduct and has beenfound liable for sexual abuse— come to the defense of a controversial nominee. In 2019, Trump argued that  Kavanaugh should “start suing people for libel,” adding that the “lies being told about him are unbelievable.” On Friday morning, ahead of Hegseth’s seemingly inevitable confirmation, Trump described Hegseth as a “good man.” “Pete’s a very, very good man,” the president said. “I hope he makes it; I hope he makes it.” Hegseth has indeed “made it” — even after Armed Services Committee members received a sworn affidavit from Hegseth’s former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, claiming hissecond wife feared for her personal safetyduring their marriage, at one point hiding from her then-husband in a closet. (Hegseth denied the allegations and, in a statement to NBC News, his ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth, said there was “no physical abuse in my marriage.”) As was the case with Kavanaugh, only two Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins — are willing to break from party lines. Sen. Mike Rounds told reportersthat the affidavit “doesn’t change anything,” adding that it’s just another instance of a “third party coming in saying something which is directly contradictory to what the individual they’ve identified has said.” As was the case with Kavanaugh, only two Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins — are willing to break from party lines. “If you think Vladimir Putin or anyone else isn’t watching this circus of Pete Hegsteh and laughing at how we’re putting someone so uniquely unqualified by their disposition and their experience, you have another think coming,”Sen. Jacky Rosen told MSNBC’s Ana Cabrera. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,” Ford once said, “the uproarious laughter between the two [men] and their having fun at my expense.” In 2018, after two of his former White House aides quit amid accusations of domestic violence, Trump claimed men’s lives are being “shattered and destroyed by mere allegations.” “Some are true and some are false,”he tweeted at the time. “Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused — life and career gone.” When applied to Pete Hegseth’s confirmation, Trump’s statement is a proven lie. Instead, Hegseth’s confirmation serves as a continuation of Trump and the Republican Party’s ongoing victimhood campaign. With every credible accusation of rape, assault or violence comes a wave of “woe is me” declarations at war with their hyper-masculine facades. Men like Kavanaugh, Hegseth and Trump are at once the epitome of rugged virility and perpetually fragile targets of so-called “dangerous” women. It has become a feature, not a bug, of many far-right heroes to receive accusations of gender-based violence — a sure-fire way to fail upward while being hailed as a conquering hero, leaving a trail of Jane Does in their wake. I’m now five weeks postpartum with my third child — a girl — as I once again watch a man accused of violence against women ascend to a powerful political position. Instead of a kick to the ribs, I am navigating sleepless nights and breastfeeding pains as I grapple with the inescapable reality that not much has changed when it comes to the ways society views my sons and now my daughter. I could hope — against my better judgment and against all evidence to the contrary — that, after another six years pass, things will look very different. I can hope that accusations of assault against men in positions of power will carry more weight and require more than perfunctory inquiries or mild concern. But even if that is the case, and we demand more of our elected officials and their Cabinet and judicial appointees, the details of what society has come to accept will undoubtedly remain “indelible in the hippocampus” of this country’s collective psyche.

On Thursday, the 25th Navajo Nation Counciladdressed reports— including one from an Arizona state lawmaker — that members of their tribe had been swept up in the raids being conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Arizona state Sen. Theresa Hatathlie, a Democrat, noted that many members of the tribe may lack federally recognized identification documents. The following day, the office of Navajo Nation President Buu Nygrenissued a news releaseciting “negative, sometimes traumatizing, experiences” among Navajos and advising tribal members to “carry state-issued identification, such as a driver’s license, other picture identification, or their Certificate of Indian blood, known as a CIB.” This appears to be the kind of dubious profiling that activists feared Trump would unleash as president. Essentially, that means Navajos are being encouraged to carry their“freedom papers”to avoid harassment from Trump’s immigration officials. This appears to be the kind of dubious profiling that activistsfeared Trump would unleashas president. And it’s more than a little ironic that a crusade supposedly designed to make America great is harassing people who arguably have more right to be here — legally and morally — than just about anyone else. Nygren’s news release said his office has been in contact with members of Congress and officials from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the governors of Arizona and Mexico. On Monday,CNN reported: At least 15 Indigenous people in Arizona and New Mexico have reported being stopped at their homes and workplaces, questioned or detained by federal law enforcement and asked to produce proof of citizenship during immigration raids since Wednesday, according to Navajo Nation officials.  These don’t appear to be the only incidents of mistaken immigration status by ICE, and they won’t be the last. Last week in Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Barakareleased a statementafter an ICE raid in his city, saying that citizens — including a U.S. military veteran with military documentation — had been detained without the agents producing a warrant. “This egregious act is in plain violation of the Fourth Amendment,” Baraka wrote. ICE, for what it’s worth, essentially said such acts are simply the cost of doing business. “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual’s identity,” the agencysaid in a statement.

There are a lot of reasons to doubt that his plans will get us to the Red Planet, and he may even put us further behind schedule. Inhis inaugural addressMonday, Trump said the country would “pursue our manifest destiny into the stars” and “plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.” Almost everything that Trump has said and done indicates that a trip to Mars is about as likely to happen as Trump's broken first-term promise to repeal Obamacare. It’s an ambitious goal and one of the few he’s laid out for his second term that has broad support. Ina 2023 poll, 57% of Americans favored sending astronauts to Mars, making itmuch more popularthanTrump’s pardons for Jan. 6 participants,attempt to overturn birthright citizenshipand proposal forbroad-based tariffs on foreign goods, all of which majorities oppose. But other than that single sentence, almost everything Trump has said and done indicates that a trip to Mars is about as likely to happen as Trump’sbroken first-term promisesto repeal Obamacare, make Mexico pay for a border wall and guarantee six weeks of paid family leave. In that term, Trump also said America would go to Mars, signing legislation that directed NASA to plan a mission that would launch in 2033. But he was so blasé about his own proposal that he apparently forgot about it when holding a video chat with an astronaut that same year, then got annoyed whenshe notedthat the Mars landing wouldn’t happen before he left office. A trip to Mars was included inthe 2024 Republican platform, which said only that the U.S. would “create a robust Manufacturing Industry in Near Earth Orbit, send American Astronauts back to the Moon, and onward to Mars.” (To be fair, theDemocratic platformalso included only one sentence, noting that NASA would send Americans “back to the moon and to Mars.”) But Mars does not appear in the Trump campaign’sAgenda 47list of core promises or the detailedProject 2025 proposalfrom conservative groups, which doesn’t even have a section on NASA. Even in these abbreviated references, you might notice a subtle change that could prove consequential. All of them reference America going back to the moon for the first time since 1972 and then to Mars. But Trump skipped past the moon. A clue to the reason for that omission comes from billionaire SpaceX founder Elon Musk, whopostedon X in December that “we’re going straight to Mars” and called a moon mission “a distraction.” NASA hasn’t seen it that way. Its goal has long been to use the planned Artemis moon missions as a first step toward going to Mars, testing the larger crewed spaceships on a trip that would take only days instead of the months it would take to get to Mars — kind of like taking the kids to a nearby Six Flags to see if they’re ready to go to Disney World. But it sounds like Trump is following Musk’s lead. He hasnominated billionaire Jared Isaacman,who has paid for two private trips to space on SpaceX rockets and is close with Musk, to lead NASA. And heskipped over a career officialwho has defended the Artemis program when appointing an acting administrator to serve until Isaacman can be confirmed. Some NASA observersthink Trump will cancelthe moon missions. It’s hard to find the logic in any of this. The directive to return to the moon before going to Mars literally came from Trump himself in his first term. If Trump doesn’t cancel it, NASA is planning to send a crewed spaceship on a flyby of the moon in 2026 and land on the moon in 2027. Unlike John F. Kennedy, whose moon shot was finally achieved under his one-time opponent, Richard Nixon, Trump could celebrate his own moon mission while still serving as president. Trump clearly wants some kind of a space triumph. Hecreated the Space Forceand said he wanted to go to Mars by the end of his first term. Hesaid at a rallywith Musk in October that America would go to Mars before the end of his second term, though he didn’t specify whether that meant an unmanned spacecraft or actual American space boots on the ground. He’s not the first president to propose going to Mars. President George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush both proposed sending astronauts to the Red Planet. But while popular, the idea often founders because it’s so costly. A2016 estimateput the figure at half a trillion dollars. The price has only gone up since then, and we stilldon’t have the technologyto keep astronauts alive on such a long ride or develop the fuel for a return trip. Because missions to Mars can only happen when the two planets are relatively close to each other, there’s basically only one chance to send a spaceship there during Trump’s second term, which would be in late 2026, which is far too soon given the technological limitations we’re already up against. To sum it all up: Trump appears ready to upend years of planning for a moon mission that he proposed in favor of a dramatic new plan to go to Mars that has not been fleshed out in any way, likely as a favor to a billionaire friend who would personally benefit if NASA awarded a contract worth hundreds of billions of dollars to his company and on behalf of a promise that requires developing and launching unproven technology in the next two years. That’s not gonna happen. This is a moon shot proposal that won’t take us back to the moon, and likely won’t take us to Mars, either. Ryan Teague Beckwith is a newsletter editor for MSNBC.

        "content": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows American presidents throughout history have broken with precedent before, but for a president-elect tolaunch a crypto “meme coin”days before his inauguration is really out there on the bleeding edge of the untested. AsDonald Trumpreturns to the White House following his 2024 electoral victory, his association with a meme coin launch represents an unprecedented convergence ofpresidential influenceand speculative finance. EvenAndrew Jackson, who had a notorious appetite for gambling and financial risk, never displayed such brazenness as to promote an investment product on the eve of assuming office. These are purely speculative instruments, unapologetically existing for no reason other than to enrich their creators. While the value of established cryptocurrencies remains a subject ofconsiderable debateamong economists andtechnologists, other cryptocurrencies often peddle a narrative justification centered on utility. Proponents of bitcoin, for instance, suggest its potential as a digital analog to gold, or as a payment network; ethereum adherents point to so-calledsmart contracts. Whether such proposed applications ultimately prove viable remains highly questionable, and many critics argue that these narratives are fundamentally incoherent. Meme coins, in contrast, dispense with the pretense of utility or narrative: These are purelyspeculative instruments, unapologetically existing for no reason other than to enrich their creators. The mechanics of meme coins are remarkably straightforward: Initial purchasers acquire tokens at a nominal cost. Publicity intensifies, often fueled by social media amplification and a fear of being left behind, and prices spike. Early investors can then sell their holdings to later buyers at a profit. This dynamic, however, is inherently unsustainable, and the inevitable result is that subsequent investors are left holding largely valueless digital tokens that are untethered from any asset or income. It’s a mathematical certainty that a majority of participants will incur financial losses — the only question is the precise distribution of those losses. The value of these tokens rests solely on their ability to induce successive purchasers to pay an inflated price, a characteristic that invites comparison to pyramid schemes without the overt promise of guaranteed returns. The launch ofthe Trumps’ tokensjust before the inauguration represents a troubling development in the realm of money in politics. It’s shocking to have the presidential office even tangentially connected to such a nakedly speculative financial undertaking at such a sensitive political moment. This timing seems to suggest that supporting the candidate and engaging in a risky financial gamble are somehow connected, a notion that raises significant ethical concerns about the influence ofpersonal financial interestsonpolitical decision-makingand could potentially leadto conflicts of interest. The dangers surrounding meme coins arise not so much because they exist in a regulatory vacuum, but because some crypto businesses operate with a cynical disregard for the laws wealreadyhave. Traditional financial markets have rules that forbid predatory offerings and market manipulation and that require disclosures, but many crypto operations openly flout these regulations, knowing that regulators are often too underresourced to enforce them. The result is a perfect storm for market manipulation, with concentrated ownership and coordinated buying campaigns conducted openly on social media platforms. This pattern of market behavior is eerily reminiscent of the “robber baron” era of the late 19th century. Before the advent of securities laws, powerful figures amassed fortunes through schemes that often left ordinary investors in financial ruin. That era, characterized by limited regulatory oversight, allowed many predatory schemes and abuses that ultimately led to the modern securities regulations that govern traditional finance today. What’s particularly fraught about the present circumstance is the combination of a historically familiar pattern with the speed and reach of digital technology, and now the direct association with a presidential transition. Potential buyers may not understand that they’re not investing in anything real — they’re merely buying tokens in a digital game of hot potato, where the only way to win is to pass their holdings to someone else at a higher price before the music stops. The overall rise of crypto reflects a deeper nihilism in American culture — a collective rejection of fundamental value and the premise of markets. The overall rise of crypto reflects a deeper nihilism in American culture — a collective rejection of fundamental value and the premise of markets. In this worldview, if investing is a rigged game, why not embrace the absurdity? Such a cynical perspective approaches markets as a mere casino where the only things that matter are momentum and hype. That this mindset has become intertwined with the presidency, with tokens backed by nothing but vanity and political loyalty, reveals a profound loss of faith in institutions and the very concept of value itself. For the public, the message should be unequivocal: Meme coins, irrespective of their branding or timing, are not legitimate investments. They are speculative gambles, more like lottery tickets than financial assets. When draped in political symbolism and launched at times of heightened public attention, they become an especially dangerous proposition: a chimera of political devotion and financial recklessness that is fraught with moral hazard and does not serve the public interest. The launch of a personal meme coin by a president represents a dangerous confluence of political power and speculative finance that would be bad on its own. More fundamentally — and more troubling — it represents a betrayal of the duty of the office. Using the highest office of the land to promote a financial product designed to transfer wealth from the public to a private individual undermines the institutional integrity of the presidency itself. The Trump meme coin may be just the latest chapter in this ongoing story, but it signals a troubling new direction in the use of political influence for financial gain.

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Even before the sun heralded a frigid dawn, a huge and restless crowd set off north along Gaza's coastal road. They were young and old. Many carried large white plastic bags and suitcases, others small children. Some hopped slowly on crutches and others wore flip-flops, while a few even walked barefoot. One pair of young men linked arms as they strode and sang. As dawn broke in Gaza on Monday,footage and photos capturedby NBC News’ crew showed tens of thousands ofPalestiniansheading toward a checkpoint onthe Netzarim corridor, which bisects the enclave, and into the heavily bombed north. The path is named for a former Israeli settlement, and is considered vital by the Israeli military hoping to keep militants from traveling across Gaza. For many, the journey home after15 months of Israeli bombardmentbrought tears as they held onto their loved ones and clutched their belongings tightly. Others traveled in cars, trucks and rickshaws lined up along the highway, carrying tents and mattresses after seeking shelter in the central and southern parts of the enclave. Under the terms of theceasefire agreementbetween Israel and Hamas, residents of northern Gaza were slated to return over the weekend before Israel closed the crossings after it said Hamas had breached the deal by failing to release Arbel Yehud, a 29-year-old Israeli civilian hostage. The hold-up came asPresident Donald Trumpsaid Saturday thatPalestinians should leave the Gaza Stripto “clean out” the enclave, adding that he had asked the king of Jordan to take them in. News that Israel would reopen the first checkpoint in central Gaza at 7 a.m. local time (midnight ET) came Sunday afterQatari mediators announcedthat Hamas had agreed to hand over Yehud along with two other hostages. For many displaced residents, the thought of reuniting with family  brought a renewed sense of hope and jubilation. The violence drove some 90% of the enclave's residents from their homes, with many living for months in squalid tent camps. Palestinians who had been waiting at the roadblocks for two days burst into cheers as Israeli troops monitored from the sidelines. Sanaa Al-Qassab, 45, told NBC News that she hadn't expected to return to her home in northern Gaza, as she held her young daughter's hand while walking along the sandy strip with heavy bags slung over her shoulder. “We waited here for three days in the cold and hunger to return,” she said. “They told us we would return at this time and then another time.” “I am very happy we will meet our families,” she added. The move brokered by Qatar and Egypt would allow around 650,000 Palestinians in central and southern Gaza to return to the north of the enclave. “I haven’t seen my family for a year and a half, I want to go back to see them. I’ve been waiting for three days to go to my parents,” Mohammed Adas, 19, told Reuters. Ghada, a mother of five, told Reuters via a chat app that she had “no sleep” in anticipation of returning home. “I have everything packed and ready to go with the first light of day,” she said, adding, “At least we are going back home, now I can say war is over and I hope it will stay calm.” Local health officials say more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israeli bombing during the conflict, whichbegan Oct. 7, 2023, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on Israel in which Israeli officials say 1,200 people were killed and 251 people taken hostage. The fighting is currently paused since aceasefire dealwent into effect Jan. 15. Astha Rajvanshi is a reporter for NBC News Digital, based in London.

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion in market value Monday as tech stocks plunged amid fears that Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeekleapfrogged U.S. dominance in AI development. The Nasdaq Composite, which tracks the country's largest tech firms, plunged more than 3%. The Dow ended up nearly 300 points after falling earlier in the day, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 1.5%. The sell-off was sparked by advances claimed by China’s DeepSeek, whose outstanding qualities became evident this weekend. The open-source model was first released in December, when the company said it took only two months and less than $6 million to create. Those claims would be far less than the hundreds of billions of dollars that American tech giants such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and others have poured into developing their own models, fueling fears that China may be passing the U.S. in the scale and efficiency of their AI investments. DeepSeek’s app is now the top free app in the Apple App Store, pushing OpenAI’s ChatGPT into second place. Among the biggest losers in the stock market slump: chipmaker Nvidia, whose shares plummeted as much as 18%. Nvidia has been among the better performers as of late, with shares soaring more than 200% over the course of the last two years, making it one of the largest companies in the world.Nvidia's losses represent the biggest market value drop in U.S. stock market history,according to Bloomberg. Nvidia said in a statement that \"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement\" and an example of what is possible, \"leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.\" Other semiconductor companies also saw major losses. Micron Technology and Arm Holdings fell 10%, while ASML slid 6%. Mega-cap tech firms also felt the pain, with Microsoft falling 2% and Google parent, Alphabet, falling 4%. Meta Platforms, which is developing its own open-source AI model, fell earlier in the day but ended higher by 1.9%. Worries about DeepSeek's alleged advances come despite export controls on sales of advanced semiconductors to China. Speaking at the World Economic Forum last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said DeepSeek's advances appeared to be \"super impressive ... and super-compute efficient.\" \"We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously,\" Nadella added. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the Select Committee on China, said \"the U.S. cannot allow CCP models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions. We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek’s AI infrastructure.\" At the end of 2024, Microsoft said it planned $35 billion in investments to build \"trusted and secure AI and cloud datacenter infrastructure.\" Constellation Energy, which inked a deal with Microsoft to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to power artificial intelligence servers, sank 20%. Shares of other power companies seen as AI beneficiaries such as Vistra Energy and NRG Energy also dropped sharply. Siemens Energy, which makes equipment for utility companies, plunged 20%. GE Vernova, another maker of power equipment, fell more than 21%. Not everyone is convinced by DeepSeek's announcements. \"We believe that ... DeepSeek did not 'build OpenAI for $5M,'\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgonwrotein a note to clients Monday. \"The models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles.\" Giuseppe Sette, a president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, said the underlying tech for DeepSeek appears to be \"extremely bullish in the long-term\" because it could be a playbook for other AI firms going forward. \"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less. In layman terms, they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power. This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years,\" Sette wrote in a note Monday. Steve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.

In addition to striking at senior leadership in bureaus across the agency, the action specifically targeted senior attorneys, according to the two former USAID officials and a current official. Follow live politics coverage USAID employees were informed of the decision late Monday afternoon. “We have identified several actions within USAID that appear to be designed to circumvent the President’s Executive Orders and the mandate from the American people,” said the email from acting USAID Administrator Jason Gray, which was obtained by NBC News. “As a result, we have placed a number of USAID employees on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice while we complete our analysis of these actions.” USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening. USAID works to coordinate foreign aid and humanitarian development. Though it is an independent federal agency, it collaborates and receives policy guidance from the secretary of state. Some of the agency’s responsibilities include providing humanitarian relief in response to conflicts and natural disasters, as well as promoting global health, environmental sustainability and education. Former USAID official Jeremy Konyndyk said the decision by the Trump administration was a fundamental misread of what career staff exist to do. “In my experience, they always do work in good faith as intermediaries between the political guidance that they get from the leadership of their building and from the White House, and turn that into development policy,” said Konyndyk who is now president of Refugees International. He added that the sweeping action seemed like an attempt to intimidate and instill fear throughout the building. “This is a destroying the village in order to save it approach to governing,” he said.

Dan De Luce Abigail Williams Flights to the United States out of Kabul for Afghans who received special visas for their work with the U.S. government have been suspended, three sources with Afghan advocacy organizations said. Last week, the State Department’s office overseeing refugee admissions informed nonprofit organizations in a memo that all refugee resettlement activities were suspended. But the memo said flights for Afghans who have special immigrant visas would continue. However, the flights for Special Immigrant Visa holders are now halted, said Shawn Van Diver of the advocacy group #AfghanEvac and two other sources with knowledge of the matter. The flights have been halted as a result of executive orders Trump issued. One order halted refugee resettlement, which shut down processing for Special Immigrant Visa holders after they leave Afghanistan. Another executive orderfroze U.S. foreign aid, which suspended reception services for Afghans flying to the United States with Special Immigrant Visas, Van Diver and other advocates said. About 40,000 to 50,000 Afghans who have been granted Special Immigrant Visas or who are due to get them could be affected, Van Diver said. The visas were created for Iraqis and Afghans who worked as interpreters or in other jobs for the U.S. Embassy or military — but the program was plagued by incessant delays for years. “They’ve had their visa interviews, they’ve done all the steps, they’ve followed all the rules,” he said. “They’ve done what we’ve asked them. ... They’re freaking out.” In the meantime, the Afghans with links to the United States are at risk of detention and persecution by the Taliban regime, advocates say.

According to the VA, the workers’ combined salaries total more than $8 million, and the combined value of the contracts is more than $6 million. It said it is also removing “DEI-related media” from its digital properties. “We are proud to have abandoned the divisive DEI policies of the past and pivot back to VA’s core mission.

Lori Chavez-DeRemer, citing pro-union stances she has taken in the past that clash with the business community. “I’m not going to support her,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a senior member of the committee that will oversee her nomination, told NBC News today. “I’m the national spokesman and lead author of the right-to-work bill. Her support for the PRO Act, which would not only oppose national right to work but would pre-empt state law on right to work — I think it’s not a good thing. “And it’d be sort of hard for me, since it’s a big issue for me, to support her. So I won’t support her. I think she’ll lose 15 Republicans,” Paul added, predicting she would win some Democrats because “she’s very pro-labor.” Read the full story here. Kimmy Yam From cultural musicians’ being banned from performing to diversity-related posters’ being taken down, federal agency workers say professional groups meant to support employees, many of whom are from marginalized backgrounds, are under threat from Trump’s executive order that seeks to end government employee diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Several workers across federal agencies told NBC News that their employee resource groups (ERGs), which are voluntary, employee-led affinity groups, have been put on pause, with meetings and events abruptly canceled to comply with the executive order. Others involved in the ERGs said they pre-emptively shut down their groups themselves or removed their email distribution lists out of fear that any potential noncompliance with the directive could threaten their jobs.

Katherine Doyle Trump said repeat criminal offenders could be moved overseas to countries where the United States would pay a small fee. He billed it as a cost-saving measure. “I want them out of our country,” Trump said at a conference for House Republicans in Miami. “I also will be seeking permission to do so — we’re going to get approval, hopefully, to get them the hell out of our country … let them be brought to a foreign land and maintained by others for a very small fee.” Trump added that doing so would avert using U.S. private prisons, which he said “charge us a fortune.” Kate Santaliz Zoë Richards The Senate confirmedScott Bessent, a former hedge fund executive and top donor to Trump's campaign, as treasury secretary in a 68-29 votetonight. Sixteen Democrats voted with all Republicans to confirm him. Katherine Doyle Trump, speaking to House Republicans in Miami today, mused aboutrunning again for re-electionand how he’ll spend the money he has raised. “I’ve raised a lot of money for the next race that I assume I can’t use for myself, but I’m not 100% sure,” he said. “I think I’m not allowed to run again.” A House Republican last weekintroduced a measurethat would set in motion the process to adopt a constitutional amendment allowing Trump to seek a third term. Trump continued to entertain the prospect of a future presidential run, prodding Speaker Johnson, who moments earlier had introduced him onstage, to promise a \"new renaissance.\" “Am I allowed to run again?\" Trump asked. \"Mike, I better not get you involved in that.” The Constitution sets a two-term limit for the presidency, meaning that for Trump to serve a third presidential term in 2028 or later, a constitutional amendment would be required. Ken Dilanian Ryan J. Reilly Reporting from Washington The Justice Department said today that it fired several career lawyers involved in prosecuting Trump, escalating his campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies. The employees worked on special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation that led to now-dismissed indictments against Trump over his handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the lead-up to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. “Today, Acting Attorney General James McHenry terminated the employment of a number of DOJ officials who played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,” a Justice Department official wrote to NBC News. “In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the President’s agenda.

But Greenland is not for sale,” they said. “The United States, like Denmark, should recognize that the future will be defined by partnership, not ownership. To ensure our alliance reaches its full potential, Americans must view Greenland as an ally, not an asset. Open for business, but not for sale.” Trump has suggested he coulduse military force to take ownershipof Greenland as hepushesan expansionist agenda.

Martin said he was appointing two officials to look at the use of the 1512 charge and ordered them to issue a preliminary report by Friday. “Obviously, the use was a great failure of our office ... and we need to get to the bottom of it,” Martin wrote before he asked workers to deliver “all files, documents, notes, emails and other information” about the use of the charge. The note came in an email that also commiserated with Washington Commanders fans nursingtheCommanders'loss to the Philadelphia Eaglesin yesterday's NFC championship game and reminded U.S. attorney’s office workers of the hiring freeze and the end of “all DEI efforts.” Martin is a “stop the steal” advocate who spoke at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, and was on the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6.

A group of immigrants rights organizations in Chicago sued the Trump administration yesterday to stop ICE raids in the city, arguing they “are retaliatory in nature and violate the First Amendment.” The advocacy groups, represented by Just Futures Law and the Civil Rights Clinic of Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, are seeking an emergency hearing to obtain a temporary restraining order against ICE as they seek a long-term end to the raids. Chicago has designated itself a sanctuary city under the Welcoming City Ordinance, which means it does not ask its residents about immigration status, disclose that information to law enforcement authorities or deny city services based on immigration status. The groups argued in their lawsuit that the Trump administration's use of immigration enforcement personnel to conduct raids and make arrests across the city is an unconstitutional move intended to signal Trump's “animosity toward sanctuary cities.” “The federal government’s plan to use Chicago-based immigration raids to quash the Sanctuary City Movement is a clear and obvious violation of the First Amendment,” the filing said. The groups said in a news release that the lawsuit “is about prohibiting the Trump Administration from using law enforcement to decimate a vital social justice movement.” “In Chicago, the Trump administration isn’t just trying to unleash arbitrary immigrant enforcement. The impending raids are a brazen attempt to stomp out the sanctuary city movement and run roughshod over the First Amendment,” said Sheila Bedi of the Community Justice Clinic, an advocacy organization involved in the suit. The Justice Department has until Wednesday to file a response to the request for a temporary restraining order. Annemarie Bonner Speaker Johnson said today he hasn't spoken to Trump after he threatened to withhold aid to California wildfire victims ifvoter ID laws are notestablished. \"We've got to work out the details of that.

Mehta wrote that the court will vacate an order last week that added \"location restrictions\" to defendants because, he said, it would be \"improper\" for the court to modify their original sentences after Trump commuted them. \"Further, by virtue of the President’s commutation order, the court acknowledges that its conditions of supervision will not be enforced,\" Mehta said. Mehtaruled Friday that Rhodes would be barred from enteringWashingtonwithout the court's approval, despite the commutation. Rhodes was released last week after having spent the last three years in prison for his conviction of seditious conspiracy over his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. He wasoriginally sentenced to 18 years in prison. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say 956 people were arrested in raids across the country on Sunday, and 2,681 arrests have been made since Trump’s inauguration. Border czar Tom Homan confirmed to NBC News that some of those arrests were “collaterals,\" not criminals. Garrett Haake Rebecca Shabad Trump is expected to sign four executive orders today, including one related to Covid vaccine requirements within the military andone that would create adefense system for the U.S. like Israel'sIron Dome. Under the first executive order, U.S. service members who were dismissed from the military forrefusing to take the Covid vaccinewould be reinstated with full back pay and benefits. The order said \"government redress of these wrongful dismissals is overdue.\" Another order would create an \"Iron Dome for America,\" named after the air defense system that protects Israel from rockets and missiles. It would implement \"a next generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next generation aerial attacks,\" according to the White House.

In his first interview since stepping down from a lead position at ICE, the agency’s former acting director, Patrick Lechleitner, told Andrea Mitchell he “couldn’t agree more” with Trump border czar Tom Homan’s argument that ICE should have unrestricted access to jails in sanctuary cities. “It’s when they release people and don’t tell us things become challenging,” Lechleitner said of jails releasing undocumented immigrants without communicating their immigration status to ICE. “All of a sudden, these individuals are very difficult to identify. They’re in the community. Now we have to get a fugitive operations team together.” Homan made the case to NBC News for unrestricted ICE access to jails in sanctuary cities in an interview at the southern border last week. Homan declined to put a price tag on Trump’s sprawling mass deportation agenda, but said the estimated $86 billion is a “great start.” Lechleitner, when asked about the cost of sustaining the expansive ICE operations, said, “This is going to require a lot of money to keep this up and sustain it. That’s where Congress comes in.” Lechleitner, who was critical of the Biden administration’s handling of the border upon stepping down, noted numbers of illegal crossings were “very high,” saying of the administration, “I wish they had gone in and done some work earlier.” He pointed to the nondetained docket, a list of noncitizen immigrants who are not being held while awaiting their immigration proceedings, arguing the “well over 8 million people out there” were “overwhelming the capabilities of ICE.” Speaking about the Trump administration’s interagency support for federal immigration enforcement, Lechleitner, said it’s “nice to see the people of ICE getting the support they need to do the work that they’re being asked to do,” because it is “just too much for ICE to do on its own.” Ryan J. Reilly Ken Dilanian Corey Amundson, the head of the public integrity unit at the Justice Department, has resigned, NBC News has learned. NBC Newsreportedlast week that Amundson was among the DOJ officials who had been informed they were being reassigned to the effort to take legal action against so-called sanctuary cities. Amundson would have had to sign off on parts of the Jack Smith investigation, under Justice Department policy. Matt Dixon TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Trump’s push to quickly overhaul the nation’s immigration system is at the center of a civil war between Republicans in Florida, with Gov. Ron DeSantis facing off against the GOP-dominated state Legislature. DeSantis earlier this month called lawmakers back to Tallahassee for a special legislative session with the explicit purpose ofaligning state lawwith an expected wave of immigration-focused executive orders from Trump. But Republican leaders in both the state House and Senate, who had previously panned DeSantis’ plans as “premature,” abruptly ended the special session Monday morning and quickly called their own. The move effectively killed all the legislation already filed by DeSantis’ allies, and allowed Republican leadership to draw up their own immigration proposals, including language that puts the governor in a tricky political position. The plan from legislative leaders would take sweeping immigration oversight authority away from DeSantis and move it to Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, a statewide elected official who is eyeing a run forgovernorin 2026 and has had an icy relationship with DeSantis.

Wang Navajo citizens in Southwestern states have reported “negative, sometimes traumatizing experiences with federal agents targeting undocumented immigrants” in the week since Trump issued a series of strict immigration-related executive orders, according to Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren. In a statement Friday, Nygren said that “recent reports of negative interactions with federal immigration agents have raised concerns that have prompted fear and anxiety among our community members,” noting his office has been inundated with calls from Navajo citizens in Arizona and New Mexico reporting interactions with federal immigration agents who have asked them for proof of citizenship. Nygren urged Navajo citizens to remain “calm and assured” in their interactions with federal immigration enforcement officials and announced that his office has set up a hotline to field related tips and complaints. “It’s best to be prepared,” Nygren said. He advised Navajo citizens to carry their certificates of Indian blood, official documents issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs that designates Native American ancestry, when they are in public. Nygren also recommended citizens carry state-issued identification, like driver's licenses, saying “it can provide an additional layer of reassurance.” Nygren said that the advice his office received from the relevant federal and state agencies has been “valuable” and that tribal leaders are “better prepared to address this issue head on.” In addition to the hotline, Nygren announced his office is working to secure professional counselors to provide mental health support to Navajo citizens “suffering the emotional and mental impacts of negative encounters with federal immigration agents.” The Navajo tribe is one of the largest federally recognized tribes in the United States, and its designated tribal land extends across the Southwest states of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Kate Santaliz Kyla Guilfoil Senate Democrats introduced a resolution today to condemn Trump's blanket pardons rioters found guilty of assaulting police officers in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. “I refuse to allow President Trump to rewrite what happened on January 6th—armed insurrectionists, incited by Trump himself, broke into the U.S. Capitol and violently assaulted Capitol Police officers in their attempt to overthrow a free and fair election,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who led the initiative alongside Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Andy Kim, D-N.J., said in a release. Sen. John Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, was the final Democrat to sign the resolution, bringing it unanimous support from the chamber's Democrats. Murray told NBC News she will try to get Senate approval of the resolution this week by a procedure known as unanimous consent, meaning if just one Republican senator objects, the measure won't be adopted. \"Affirming that U.S. senators condemn unconditional pardons for people who were found guilty of violently assaulting Capitol Police officers should be the easiest thing in the world,\" Murray said. \"If Republicans care even the tiniest bit about law enforcement, they should be outraged by these pardons. I hope and expect my Republican colleagues will allow this very simple resolution to pass as a show of support for the officers who put their lives on the line to keep senators safe.” Rebecca Shabad Annemarie Bonner One of the inspectors general fired by Trumplast week, Hannibal \"Mike\" Ware, warned in an interview on MSNBC this morning that the president's terminations of 18 of them amount to a \"threat to democracy.\" He said the reason given for his firing was \"changing priorities of the administration.\" \"The reason that is alarming is because IGs are not a part of any administration,\" Ware said. \"IGs oversee how the priorities of the administration is being conducted to make sure that there is transparency in government, and to make sure that there’s no fraud waste and abuse, and how taxpayer funds are being expended.\" Ware added, \"We’re looking at what amounts to a threat to democracy, a threat to independent oversight and a threat to transparency in government.\" Ware served as the inspector general overseeing the Small Business Administration.

Rebecca Shabad Trump hassigned an executive orderseeking to circumvent federal and state laws dealing with California’s water system in an effort to provide the southern part of the state with necessary water resources to fight wildfires. Almost immediately after the onset of therecent spate of wildfires in Los Angeles, “firefighters were unable to fight the blaze due to dry hydrants, empty reservoirs, and inadequate water infrastructure,” the executive order said. Trump’s order said the wildfire disaster has affected the entire country and it’s in the nation’s “interest to ensure that California has what it needs to prevent and fight these fires and others in the future.” “Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to provide Southern California with necessary water resources, notwithstanding actively harmful State or local policies,” the order said.

Greg Abbott directed the state Military Department today to deploy the Texas Tactical Border Force to the Rio Grande Valley to coordinate with the U.S. Border Patrol. Departing from military bases in Fort Worth and Houston this morning, the force will surge more than 400 additional soldiers, as well as C-130s and Chinook helicopters, to join thousands of Texas National Guard soldiers already deployed on the border. “Texas has a partner in the White House we can work with to secure the Texas-Mexico border,” Abbott said in a statement. “To support that mission, today, I deployed the Texas Tactical Border Force, comprised of hundreds of troops, to work side-by-side with U.S. Border Patrol agents to stop illegal immigrants from entering our country and to enforce immigration laws.\" The Texas Tactical Border Force, launched in 2023, falls under the governor's Operation Lone Star, a multibillion-dollar effort to revamp border security in Texas. According to the release, the operation has deployed thousands of Texas National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers to the border, apprehended more than 530,000 illegal immigrants, arrested more than 50,000 criminals, and seized more than 622 million lethal doses of fentanyl — \"enough to kill every man, woman, and child in the United States, Mexico, and Canada,\" it said.

McGraw, a former psychologist who rose to fame alongside Oprah Winfrey and hosted “Dr. Phil”for more than two decades, said he had “embedded” with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to show what he described as the agency’s targeted efforts to apprehend “known criminals and terrorists.” Speaking to McGraw in a segment broadcast on the network that the former talk-show host founded one year ago — Merit Street Media — Trump administration border czar Thomas Homan told viewers to “forget the false narrative” that immigration authorities are carrying out neighborhood sweeps that target “people that are a different color than us.” “Look at what we actually do,” he said. The enforcement actions comeafter President Donald Trump promised to carry outwhat he described as the largest mass deportation plan in U.S. history — and asimmigration advocates warn people about their right to due processduring encounters with authorities, regardless of their immigration status. On Monday,a group of Quaker congregations sued the Department of Homeland Securityover the reversal of a decades-old policy last week that prevented immigration agents from conducting raids in “sensitive locations” — including houses of worship and schools — without prior approval. ICE agents tooknearly 1,200 peopleinto custody Sunday, the agency said, marking the single largest number of arrests made in a single day since Trump took office. Nearly half of those detained don’t have criminal records, according to a senior Trump administration official. In a video posted on McGraw’s X profile, the former talk show host can be seen questioning a man who appears to be handcuffed and standing on a street next to Homan. At one point, the man can be heard asking for a lawyer. At another point, when McGraw asks the man if he’d previously been deported, the man asks: “Are you Dr. Phil?” “How do you know me?” McGraw responds. “I’ve seen you on 'Dr. Phil,'” he said. In the video, Homan describes the man as undocumented and says he has been convicted of sex crimes with children. When McGraw asks the man if he committed the alleged crimes, the man says, “not really.” A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. McGraw, who ended his daytime show in 2023, spoke at Trump's rally at Madison Square GardeninOctober and called the then-candidate \"tough as an old army boot.\"In an interview afterward, McGraw said the appearance was not an endorsement. For decades before he entered the political arena, Trump watched — and accelerated — the boom of the reality TV era. Chasing celebrity, Trump made himself a constant presence in New York’s tabloid newspapers, appeared as a guest with the biggest interviewers of the last 40 or so years —from Phil Donahueto Howard Stern — and eventually launched “The Apprentice.” On that show, Trump judged candidates for a job, telling losers “You’re fired!” Maury Povich, host of the “Trash TV” talk show “Maury,”once saidthat Trump would call him to offer suggestions for the program. The late Jerry Springerlamented in 2019that Trump “took my show and brought it to the White House.” During his 2024 campaign, Trump effectively used modern formats — including podcasts and YouTube programs — that try to narrow the distance between audiences and the hosts and guests.

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time SEOUL, South Korea — Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying forRussia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them. Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living inSouth Korea, said it is “devastating” to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leaderKim Jong Un, “only to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.” He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary. Lee said his former colleagues “are essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.” For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall,North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands. UkrainianPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners’ apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict. The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports. “Honestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,” Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul. All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea. According to South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim’s name but was killed before he could succeed. The South Korean military said last week that North Korea ispreparing to send additional troops to Russiaafter about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers’ poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said. Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine underPresident Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support. Kim is thought to be providing Russian PresidentVladimir Putinwith troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, includingmultiple short-range ballistic missiles, anew hypersonic intermediate-range missileandstrategic cruise missiles. Trumpdrew ire from South Koreaon Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a “nuclear power,” a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, “both of which are driven by desperation,” said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs. The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since theVietnam War. Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea “more capable of waging war against its neighbors.” Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren’t wearing their uniforms. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents. “Even if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,” Lee said. “They were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.” Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world’s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North. “As soldiers,” Lee said, “they are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,” meaning Kim. They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee. North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said. “I think I only fired three bullets per year,” said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, “we had more like 20 bullets.” Asked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee — whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. — was skeptical. “Honestly, I’m not that sure,” he said, “because I know their training and I know they are not well trained.” For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger. North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death. Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul. He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls — “James Bond” was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas,sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard laborfor watching them. “When I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,” Lee said. “I also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship would still be in place.” The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did. “When North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,” Ahn said. “Once they realize what freedom could mean, it’s hard to imagine they wouldn’t consider breaking free to live a freer life.” In addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military’s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government. Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops. “However, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,” he said. “Through platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.” In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well. “These young people did not go knowing they were going to die,” Lee said, “but died because they did not know.

Data first obtained by NBC News shows that Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested a total of 1,179 people on Sunday, which is more than the 956 arrests that the agencyposted on Xon Sunday night. But just 613 of those total arrests — nearly 52% — were considered “criminal arrests.” The rest appear to be nonviolent offenders or people who have not committed any criminal offense other than crossing the border illegally. When breaking down those arrests, eight were considered \"Worst Criminals Arrested,\" including two gang members, according to the official. Still, at least 566 people arrested Sunday had not committed any crimes and were only detained because they lacked legal authorization to remain in the United States. Being undocumented is considered a civil offense,not a crime. But it’s considered a crime when an undocumented immigrant who was previously deported re-enters the United States without permission.  It’s unclear how many, if any, of the 566 had entered the country a second time illegally. Administration officials and President Donald Trump have stated repeatedly that they would prioritize the detention and deportations of undocumented immigrants who have committed serious crimes, but the latest numbers may be casting doubts around such promises. Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, told NBC News on Sunday he was aware of \"at least a few\" collateral arrests — detentions of people without criminal convictions who were present during the raids. He said thatthese will likely recuras immigration enforcement actions escalate across the nation. \"We want to get as many criminals as possible,\" Homan said. \"They’re a public safety threat, and so with somebody else illegally here, they’re coming, too.\" According to the latest ICE arrests data, there were 853 \"detainers lodged,\" people who were arrested on other criminal charges Sunday, but ICE may have probable cause to believe they could be up for deportation. A detainer request means that ICE asks a local jurisdiction to hold a suspected undocumented immigrant who has already been arrested in another crime. ICE may have probable cause to believe the migrant could be up for deportation. So-called sanctuary cities don't take action on detainer requests.

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time LOS ANGELES — As the charred hills ofPacific Palisadescontinue to smolder andrainstorms approach, investigators are racing touncover the origins of the devastating Jan. 7 firethat killed 11 people and destroyed more than 6,800 structures. Covering up to 10 miles of terrain each day,they have amassed more than 235 leads in their search for answers, with attention  turning to a suspicious fire that started days earlier in the same area. The investigation has zeroed in on a scorched ridgeline above an exclusive neighborhood known as the Highlands, a community perched in the mountains overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This area is near the site of a smaller blaze that the Los Angeles Fire Department said was contained in the early hours of Jan. 1, just six days before the catastrophic Jan. 7 fire erupted. Earlier this week, yellow caution tape blocked off access to a trailhead linkingthe Highlands to a popular hiking area in Topanga State Park. Many houses surrounding the trail were untouched by the inferno. But just blocks away, the scorched remains of once grand homes and blackened trees dotted the landscape. Some 75 personnel from local, state and federal agencies have fanned out around the state park, known for its stunning views of the ocean and popular landmarks like the eponymously named Skull Rock boulder and little Buddha sculpture. Both are points of particular interest in the investigation because of their proximity to the two fires, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ Los Angeles office. The Los Angeles Fire Department referred all questions regarding the Jan. 1 and Jan. 7 fires to the ATF. No homes were damaged or destroyed in the Jan. 1fire, but investigators with the ATF are exploring possible connections to the Jan. 7 inferno. They are also looking into otherhuman causeslike arson, fireworks and unauthorized camping activity. The fire is more than 84% contained as of Sunday. It has so far burned more than 23,440 acres and flare-ups have continued to spark nearly three weeks later. “We’re not leaving any stoned unturned,” Ginger Colburn, an ATF spokesperson, said outside the agency’s makeshift command center on Pacific Coast Highway. While Colburn declined to confirm a direct link between the fires, she emphasized that investigators are analyzing all the data and added that there “isn’t any reason not to go back” and look at both incidents. Highlands residents reported hearing fireworks on New Year’s Eve before a small fire broke out in the wildlands bordering the neighborhood. Firefighters responded to a call from a resident who lives about two blocks from the Skull Rock trailhead shortly after midnight on Jan. 1. By 5 a.m., that fire was out and firefighters remained on the scene afterward, according toNBC Los Angelesand residents who saw and heard fire crews hours later. That fire was largely forgotten until Jan. 7, when smoke was again spotted in the mountains and canyons surrounding the Highlands. Firefighters responded to a call from a different resident who lives about a three-minute drivefrom the address of the caller who reported the Jan. 1 fire. Both homes have backyards that face the Temescal Ridge Trail, one of several local hiking trails leading to Skull Rock. Now, investigators from local, state and federal agencies are piecing together a complex puzzle. They have reviewed over 85 hours of video footageand combed through social media posts from hikers and park visitors, Colburn said. Amy Masi, a fire investigator with the U.S. Forest Service not involved in the case, described the painstaking process that forensic experts undertake. “To figure out the cause and origin of a wildfire, a method is used that is similar to solving a mystery,” she said. The Forest Service, which trains the ATF on wildfire analysis, has three investigators working alongside the bureau on the Palisades Fire probe. Like police detectives, fire investigators observe the scene and narrow down their search area, ideally to a 25-square-foot area, according to Ed Nordskog, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff’s fire investigator not involved in the case. Then they divide the area into a grid of zones each measuring about 4 square feet. Investigators collect evidence that could include footprints, campfire remains, lighting strike ash or burned electrical equipment, he said. With the help of magnets, metal detectors and magnifying lenses, investigators search for even the smallest pieces of evidence, such as fragments of molten machinery parts, match heads, glass and remnants of fireworks. Specially trained dogs sniff out traces of accelerants and investigators carefully follow nearby electrical equipment, like fences or poles, or signs of gas-powered vehicles, which are more likely to overheat and spark a fire than electrical vehicles. Evidence is then sent to a research lab for processing to determine how long it’s been there. “Fire science is just that. It is a science, but there’s an element of art to it,” said Scott Sweetow, a former ATF fire investigator. “People assume that fire destroys everything. It doesn’t.” Burn patterns on rocks, brush and debris hold clues for investigators, who can determine how the fire moved and trace it back to its point of origin. The process can be daunting, said Matt Brossard, a former investigator with the Forest Service who is now a business representative with the National Federation of Federal Employees. Brossard, who is not involved in the investigation but helped train ATF agents in wildfire analysis, said examining an area like Topanga State Park can be especially complicated because of its topography and popularity. “If there’s any physical evidence left, that depends on weather conditions and the materials first ignited,” he said. “If it’s in the grass, we have a very easy time finding stuff in grass and heavy brush. But where the heat is much, much hotter, your evidence deteriorates because it’s burning for a longer and more intense period of time.” Unusually dry conditions leading to the Jan. 7 conflagration and the six days between the first and second fire could hold important clues for investigators. Embers can lodge deep within tree roots and get covered by heavy ash. In that scenario, embers could continue to burn underground and become dislodged during a heavy windstorm, Brossard said. The Forest Service uses infrared technology and other techniques to monitor fires underbrush for days or even weeks after they are contained, he said. But the relatively light vegetation of the Pacific Palisades landscape and the six day-stretch before the Jan. 7 fire make rekindling “very unlikely,” Sweetow said. “It’s a question a lot of people have,” he said. “Our investigators are certainly going to have it.” Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

The Chinese artificial intelligence startup hasgenerated a lot of buzzin recent weeks as a fast-growing rival to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and other leading AI tools. Earlier on Monday, DeepSeek took over rival OpenAI’s coveted spot as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. onApple’s App Store, dethroning ChatGPT for DeepSeek’s own AI Assistant. It helped inspire asignificant selloffin global tech stocks. Buzz about the company, which was founded in 2023 and released its R1 model last week, has spread to tech analysts, investors and developers, who say that the hype — and ensuing fear of falling behind in the ever-changing AI hype cycle — may be warranted. Especially in the era of the generative AI arms race, where tech giants and startups alike are racing to ensure they don’t fall behind in a marketpredicted to top $1 trillionin revenue within a decade. DeepSeek reportedly grew out of a Chinese hedge fund’s AI research unit in April 2023 to focus on large language models and reaching artificial general intelligence, or AGI — a branch of AI that equals or surpasses human intellect on a wide range of tasks, which OpenAI and its rivals say they’re fast pursuing. The buzz around DeepSeek especially began to spread last week, when the startup released R1, its reasoning model that rivals OpenAI’s o1. It’s open-source, meaning that any AI developer can use it, and has rocketed to the top of app stores andindustry leaderboards, with users praising its performance and reasoning capabilities. The startup’s models were notably built despite the U.S.curbing chip exportsto China three times in three years. Estimates differ on exactly how much DeepSeek’s R1 costs, or how many GPUs went into it. Jefferies analysts estimated that a recent version had a “training cost of only US$5.6m (assuming US$2/H800 hour rental cost). That is less than 10% of the cost ofMeta’s Llama.” But regardless of the specific numbers, reports agree that the model was developed at a fraction of the cost of rival models by OpenAI, Anthropic,Googleand others. As a result, the AI sector is awash with questions, including whether the industry’s increasing number of astronomical funding rounds and billion-dollar valuations is necessary — and whether a bubble is about to burst.

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time This was a different Jalen Hurts from the one we’ve seen lately. This was the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback driving the ball downfield. This was Hurts throwing the ball more than 20 times. This was him freed from the shackles of the run-first formula that has been working so well since the bye week. The Eagles knew they’d likely need more from the passing game to get past the Commanders in Sunday’s NFC championship game, and Hurts responded with amasterlyperformance in the Eagles’ 55-23 winat Lincoln Financial Field. “I guess he let me out of my straitjacket a little bit today,” Hurts joked after the Eagles advanced to their second Super Bowl in three years. “It’s not a matter that we can’t. It’s just a matter of if we do. It all comes down to how we execute. Comes down to our approach and everyone being on the same page and playing with good rhythm and ultimately finding a way to win. “I think the beautiful thing about this sport, about this team and, for me, from my vantage point, [is] how we’ve been able to evolve over the years since I’ve been here, finding ways to win in multiple ways. It’s a great help when you have a defense like that turning the ball over, playing hard, playing ferocious and flying to the ball. We just need to find it in us to muscle out one more.” One of the biggest questions surrounding the Eagles during this late-season run has been whether the passing game would be there when they needed it, and Hurts answered Sunday with a resounding yes. He completed 20 of 28 passes for 246 yards and a touchdown, with no interceptions for a ninth straight game. He also rushed for three touchdowns. His 110.1 passer rating gave him five career games over 100 — only 13 quarterbacks in history have more. His 12.3 yards per completion were his most since Week 10 in Dallas and the most by an Eagles quarterback in the postseason since Nick Foles’ 13.3 mark against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 52 eight years ago. Hurts is quietly having a terrific postseason. He has completed 70% of his passes for 505 yards, with three TDs, no interceptions and a 105.0 passer rating. But after he threw for just 131 and 128 yards against the Green Bay Packers and the Los Angeles Rams, he functioned at a high level Sunday in a more wide-open passing attack, throwing his second-most passes since the bye week. Hurts seemed to appreciate a bigger focus on the passing game, but he said that as long as the Eagles are winning, he really doesn’t care how much he throws the football. “I don’t play the game for stats,” Hurts said. “I don’t play the game for numbers [or] any statistical approval from anyone else. And I understand that everyone has a preconceived notion on how they want it to look or how they expect it to look. “Winning, success, is defined by that particular individual, and it’s all relative to the person. And what I define it as is winning. So the No. 1 goal is always to come out here and win.” A week from Sunday, Hurts will become the fifth quarterback to have started two Super Bowls before his 27th birthday when the Eagles face the Kansas City Chiefs at the Superdome in New Orleans. He’s the first Eagles quarterback to reach two Super Bowls, and his five career playoff wins trail only Donovan McNabb’s nine in franchise history. Since coach Nick Sirianni’s plants-growing-underground speech, Hurts has won 48 of 63 starts. He has lost 15 games since October 2021. And one of them was the last Commanders game, which he left with a concussion after just 12 plays. “Failure has to be used as a source of pain to go take that next step, and there’s always learning opportunities in everything,” Hurts said. “It’s human nature to be ignited by the shortcomings. It’s just a natural thing.” Hurts played Sunday while dealing with a knee injury he sustained in the win over the Rams, and he also said after the game that he was sick. You couldn’t tell he was compromised in any way from the way he played. “It was challenging; it was challenging,” he said. “In some ways exhausting.” Since the bye week back in September, Hurts has 33 combined touchdowns and three turnovers. That’s bonkers. After the game Sunday, Sirianni spoke glowingly about Hurts and the way he has carried the team and done whatever he has been asked to do. “I don’t want anybody else leading this team at quarterback other than him,” Sirianni said. “He’s a winner. Again, he deals with so much criticism, which just blows my mind because of the questions I have to answer. I don’t look too much into that. The questions I have to answer, it’s just like, ‘Man, this guy wins.’ He’s won his entire life. “That’s more important. Winning at quarterback is more important than any stat that you go through. I’m sure it’ll be the same thing. ‘Oh, he’s got great players around him.’ Well, you tell me a quarterback that’s won like this that has [bleep] around him. “It doesn’t happen, right? Talk about Joe Montana. Who is he throwing to? Oh, Jerry Rice. So these guys have been so good at this position have had great players around them. Whether it’s [Tom] Brady with the defense early on in his career or [Julian] Edelman or Gronk [Rob Gronkowski]. I mean, you don’t win in this game unless you have great players around you. You don’t win consistently unless you have great players around you.” And Hurts has won consistently and routinely throughout his career. He’s now 51-23 as a starter and 40-11 over the last three seasons. He has won 13 straight games he has started and finished going back to Week 4 in Tampa. His 51 wins are tied with Dan Marino for sixth-most in NFL history by a quarterback before his 27th birthday. “It kind of blows your mind,” Sirianni said. “He wins. He’s a winner. I don’t want anyone else leading us other than Jalen Hurts. I’m proud of the way he went out there and battled today and played today. He doesn’t care about anything other than winning, and I know that, and that’s selfless. “It’s amazing how much doubt there is sometimes. I can’t quite comprehend it because it doesn’t look like what people think it should look like. But the guy has been clutch. He’s won a ton of football games. ‘But you ran for this many yards.’ We don’t care how we win. We don’t care. If we rush for 300 and pass for 1 and we win, great. If we rush for 1 and pass for 300, great. Who cares? “We’ve just continued to win. He’s just continued to win.” Reuben Frank covers the Eagles for NBC Sports Philadelphia. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

The woman, Teresa Youngblut, was riding in a car with a German national, Felix Bauckholt, when border patrol agents pulled them over to conduct an immigration inspection on Jan. 20. At some point during the traffic stop,Youngblut fired at the agents, prompting at least one to shoot back, according to court documents. One of the agents, David “Chris” Maland, 44, was killed in the exchange of gunfire. Bauckholt was fatally shot after he drew a gun, court documents say, and Youngblut was wounded. The court documents do not make clear whether Maland was struck by one of the bullets Youngblut allegedly fired or a shot from a fellow agent. The shooting occurred on a highway in rural Orleans County, about 20 miles south of the Canadian border. Youngblut is set to be arraigned Monday afternoon on two federal counts, including assaulting a border patrol agent with a deadly weapon. In court papers filed earlier Monday, federal prosecutors in Vermont said Youngblut and Bauckholt both possessed firearms purchased by a resident of the state in February 2024. That person, who was not identified, is a person of interest in a double homicide in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, prosecutors said. Bauckholt flew into the U.S. in the hours before the Pennsylvania murders. Prosecutors also said that Youngblut has been in \"frequent contact\" with an individual who was detained during the investigation into the double homicide. That individual is also a person of interest in a murder investigation in Vallejo, California, federal prosecutors said. No other details were provided. Prosecutors asked a judge to keep Youngblut in jail, alleging that she is a danger to the community and a flight risk. They noted that her primary residence has not been established, and her ties to Vermont are unclear. \"An originally peaceful interaction between the United States Border Patrol and the occupants of a vehicle became confrontational based on the defendant’s conduct, and she then unnecessarily and inexplicably escalated to deadly violence,\" they said in the court filing. Prosecutors have said that Youngblut and Bauckholt were traveling with a large collection of weapons and tactical gear, including 48 rounds of .380-caliber jacketed hollow point ammunition, a ballistic helmet and night vision equipment. The pair had been under surveillance by Homeland Security Investigations since Jan. 14, according to court documents. An employee of a hotel in Lyndonville, Vermont, had contacted law enforcement to report concerns about a man and a woman who had checked into the hotel, the documents say. The woman, later identified as Youngblut, was allegedly seen carrying “an apparent firearm in an exposed carry holster.” Both Bauckholt and Youngblut were wearing “all-black, tactical style clothing with protective equipment,” according to court documents. When the Toyota Prius they were in was pulled over, Bauckholt, the registered owner of the vehicle, appeared to have an expired visa in a Department of Homeland Security database, according to court documents. But the FBI has said that Bauckholt was actually on a current visa. Rich Schapiro is a reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said Monday that it fired several career lawyers involved in prosecuting Donald Trump, escalating the president's campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies. The employees worked on special counsel Jack Smith's investigation that led to now-dismissed indictments against Trump over his handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the lead-up to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. “Today, Acting Attorney General James McHenry terminated the employment of a number of DOJ officials who played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,\" a Justice Department official wrote to NBC News. \"In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the President’s agenda. This action is consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.\" Among those let go, an official familiar with the matter told NBC News, were career prosecutors Molly Gaston, J.P. Cooney, Anne McNamara and Mary Dohrmann. Smith resigned this monthahead of Trump's inauguration. Trump's re-election effectively ended the federal criminal cases against him because of the Justice Department's long-standing policies against prosecuting sitting presidents. Trump's New York hush money case, brought by Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg, is the sole criminal case against Trump to have led to a conviction. Trump was sentenced this month to a penalty-freeunconditional discharge, making him the first convicted felon to assume the presidency. The only pending trial, the Georgia election interference case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, was stymied indefinitely afterWillis was booted from the casein December because of conflict-of-interest allegations. Trump said throughout the 2024 campaign that all of the investigations were improper and politically motivated \"witch hunts.\" He said Democrats had \"weaponized\" the Justice Department and tried to use it to undermine his re-election bid. Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland repeatedly denied that the investigations were politically motivated. They said Trump's own actions resulted in the criminal probes of his role in the Jan. 6 riot and his failure to return classified documents to the National Archives. Former Justice Department officials and legal experts have long argued that Trump should not retaliate against career civil servants who were simply doing their jobs and, in some cases, were assigned to the investigations. They said retaliating against the career prosecutors who worked on the Trump cases would have a chilling effect on the Justice Department workforce and undermine future investigations of improper acts by public officials. “Firing prosecutors because of cases they were assigned to work on is just unacceptable,” said former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance, an NBC News legal contributor. “It’s anti-rule of law; it’s anti-democracy.” A Justice Department official told NBC News: “He’s playing with the casino’s money, with house money. Whatever the government has to pay out, if any rights are found to have been violated, it’ll pale in comparison. It’s a price he’s willing to have the government pay.\" The letter sent to the employees who were fired specifically cited their roles in investigating Trump. “You played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,” the letter said, according to parts read to NBC News. “The proper functioning of government critically depends on the trust superior officials place in their subordinates. Given your significant role in prosecuting the president, I do not believe that the leadership of the department can trust you to assist in implement the president's agenda faithfully.” The letter acknowledges that the employees may appeal the decisions to the federal Merit Systems Protection Board, which adjudicates the discipline of federal employees. Former Justice Department lawyer Julie Zebrak, an expert in federal employment law, said career civil servants cannot be summarily fired. “They have civil service rights. They have due process rights,” she said. If the Justice Department is arguing that the lawyers are not performing properly, they must be subject to what is known as progressive discipline, she said, including warnings and notice. They must be allowed to hire lawyers before they lose their jobs. “There is a reason people say it’s so hard to fire federal employees,” she said. Hours after his inauguration, Trump issued anexecutive order“ending the weaponization of the federal government.” It called for the attorney general and other top officials to root out what Trump and his allies see as politicized actions directed against them. “The American people have witnessed the previous administration engage in a systematic campaign against its perceived political opponents, weaponizing the legal force of numerous Federal law enforcement agencies and the Intelligence Community against those perceived political opponents in the form of investigations, prosecutions, civil enforcement actions, and other related actions,” the order says. “These actions appear oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice or legitimate governmental objectives.” Before being appointed special counsel, Jack Smith was a career Justice Department civil servant who had previously prosecuted both Democrats and Republicans, and he staffed his office with career prosecutors and FBI agents. No evidence has surfaced publicly that anyone connected with his investigations was motivated by partisan bias against Trump or was influenced in any way by Biden political appointees. Attorney General Merrick Garland was briefed on the investigation but said he did not influence its course. “Throughout my service as Special Counsel, seeking to influence the election one way or the other, or seeking to interfere in its outcome, played no role in our work,\" Smith wrote in his resignation letter. \"My Office had one north star: to follow the facts and law wherever they led. Nothing more and nothing less.” “And to all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,” Smith wrote.

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump said Monday thatthe sudden rise of the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek“should be a wake-up call” for America’s tech companies as the runaway popularity of yet another Chinese app presented new questions for the administration and congressional leaders. Trump said he still expected U.S. tech companies to dominate artificial intelligence, but he acknowledged the challenge posed by DeepSeek, a low-cost AI assistant thatrose to No. 1 on the Apple app storeover the weekend. “The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser focused on competing,” he said as he traveled in Florida. DeepSeek is causing a panicwithin U.S. tech companiesandin the stock marketbecause it has performed well in tests compared with competing AI models from Meta and OpenAI, while it was developedat a much lower cost, according to the little-known Chinese startup behind it. Trump said he considered the low-cost model to be “very much a positive development” for AI overall, because “instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with, hopefully, the same solution.” DeepSeek is the latest in a series of Chinese apps to surge in popularity in the United States in recent weeks. Americans embraced theChinese apps RedNoteandLemon8 as alternativesto TikTok when TikTok was on the verge of being banned temporarily in the United States for its own links to China. TikTok went dark for less than a day and came back online for existing users after Trump delayed enforcement of a bipartisan law requiring either a new non-Chinese owner or a ban. TikTok, though, remains unavailable for new downloads from the Apple and Google app stores. Security experts have expressed concern about TikTok and other apps with links to China, includingfrom a privacy standpoint. Last week, Trump signed an executive order undoing certain Biden administration rulesabout AI developmentthat Trump said had held the industry back. It wasn’t immediately clear, though, what new AI policies, if any, the Trump administration or Congress might pursue in response to DeepSeek’s rise. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., the chair of the House Select Committee on China, said Monday he wanted the United States to act to slow down DeepSeek, going further than Trump did in his remarks. “DeepSeek — a new AI model controlled by the Chinese Communist Party — openly erases the CCP’s history of atrocities and oppression,” he said, referring to reports that DeepSeekcensors topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacrein 1989. “The U.S. cannot allow CCP models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions. We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek’s AI infrastructure,” he said. DeepSeek’s developers say they created the app despite U.S. controls on the export of high-performing semiconductors, leading to a vigorous online debate Monday about how effective those controls have been and what their future should be. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., defended existing export controls related to advanced chip technology and said more regulation might be needed. “While I think there’s more to learn about DeepSeek’s development activities, what’s in the public record reveals that the PRC continues [to] prioritize advancement in AI and that export control alone will not stymie their efforts,” he said, referring to China by the initials for its formal name, the People’s Republic of China. “Claims that export controls have proved ineffectual, however, are misplaced: DeepSeek’s efforts still depended on advanced chips, and PRC hyperscalers’ efforts to build out worldwide cloud infrastructure for deployment of these models is still heavily impacted by U.S. controls,” he said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called DeepSeek “a serious threat” and said China had been a “terrible trading partner.” “They abuse the system. They steal our intellectual property. They’re now trying to get a leg up on us on AI, as you’ve seen the last day or so,” he said. “It’s a serious threat to us and to our economy and our security in every way.

According to ICE, Christopher Fragoso Lara, 25, of Mexico, had been convicted of home invasion, aggravated battery, domestic battery, possession of a weapon and other crimes. A surveillance team had spotted him Monday morning at the Chicago tire shop where he worked. Agents shut down the street outside the business and arrested Fragoso Lara as he spoke to a customer outside, in subfreezing temperatures. The arrest took place without incident when NBC News was embedded with the agents during operations throughout the Chicago area Monday morning. The enforcement agents departed downtown Chicago before sunrise and drove to Berwyn, a neighborhood on the outskirts of the city. Three door-knocking operations did not result in arrests, but they demonstrated the time and manpower that goes into the operations. At each location, there were at least seven officers, from ICE and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, covering all the entrances and exits. Ten teams of about 10 federal agents apiece fanned out across the city Monday, a source familiar with the operations said. The operations came duringimmigration enforcement operations in multiple citiesaround the country ordered by President Donald Trump. The Trump administration has sought in the past week to publicly demonstrate that it is following through on Trump's promises to enact mass deportations immediately after having taken office.Arrest numbers last weekremained on par with those in September, the latest month for which figures were available, until Friday, when numbers doubled. On Sunday, ICE arrested 1,179 people,according to data first obtained by NBC News. The figure, which is higher than the 956 arreststhe agency announcedSunday night, is the largest number under the new administration. When Fragoso Lara was arrested, Chicago resident Peter Sodini was watching. He thanked the ICE agents. \"I don't mind an immigrant, but if they're breaking our laws, they don't need to be here,\" he said. Afterward, Fragoso Lara was taken to an ICE processing facility on the outskirts of Chicago, where detainees are photographed, fingerprinted and held until their deportation flights, which typically take place on Fridays. He said that he grew up in the United States and that if he is deported, he will leave his 5-year-old daughter here in the United States so she can have a better life. “She’s without me. She grows up without a father,” Fragoso Lara said, adding that his message to Trump would be to ask for a second chance. “I’m still young. I did make poor decisions, but ... I grew up and I see how life is here.” Twenty-five men and one woman were either being held or processed at the facility Monday afternoon. They are supposed to be there for no longer than 12 hours. Frank Padula, the processing center’s assistant field office director, said the facility has been particularly busy in the past week. “We’re nonstop,\" he said. \"As you can see, we got a lot of guys here processing, guys in the holding cells waiting to be processed.” While some operations, like the one to arrest Fragoso Lara, were successful, other times Monday, ICE was not able to identify and detain its targets. Earlier in the day, ICE agents and others knocked on a door and found no one was home. Then, at a second stop, they spoke with the parents of their target, who said they had lost touch with their son. The officers appeared not to ask the couple about their immigration status and moved on to another location. The Trump administration has said the crackdown targets criminals, but there has been concern that law-abiding migrants withvarying forms of legal immigration statuscould also be rounded up, otherwise known as “collateral arrests.” Asked about collateral arrests, Sam Olson, the enforcement and removal operations director in the Chicago field office, said they were possible. “We’re tasked to enforce the immigration laws,\" he said. \"If somebody is here illegally, whether or not they’ve committed crimes, there is that possibility that they could be arrested.” Officials have not always disclosed the number of migrants with and without criminal histories who have been arrested. However, just 613 of the 1,179 people arrested Sunday — nearly 52% — were considered “criminal arrests,” a senior Trump administration official said. The rest appear to be nonviolent offenders or people who have not committed any criminal offense. Being undocumented is considered a civil offense,not a crime. But it is considered a crime when an undocumented immigrant who was previously deported re-enters the United States without permission. Since Trump took office, administration officials stressed, officers have arrested a slew of violent gang members, including dozens of suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in Colorado. Still, at least 566 people arrested Sunday had not committed any crimes and were detained only because they lacked legal authorization to remain in the United States. Olson said that while ICE works to arrest criminals daily, Trump has taken a “whole of government approach” in which “we’re really bringing many different agencies out together to do it.” Gabe Gutierrez is a senior White House correspondent for NBC News.

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As cleanup efforts get underway in theLos Angeles area neighborhoods marred by wildfires, one of the biggest challenges is the large number of lithium-ion batteries that were caught in the flames. The batteries power most plug-in hybrid cars and electric vehicles, and are used in golf carts, e-bikes, laptops, cellphones and wireless earbuds. They’re also found in power banks that provide backup energy during outages, which have becomeincreasingly popular in homes. If damaged or overheated, lithium-ion batteries can ignite or even explode — residual heat sets off a chain reaction that causes the batteries to heat up uncontrollably and spontaneously combust, a process that can happen over days, weeks or months. Properties in Pacific Palisades and Altadena, where the Palisades and Eaton fireshave collectively destroyedat least 12,000 structures, had higher-than-average numbers of electric vehicles, officials said. “This will be … from our estimation, probably the largest lithium-ion battery pickup, cleanup, that’s ever happened in the history of the world,” said Steve Calanog, the Environmental Protection Agency’s incident commander for the Palisades and Eaton fire cleanups. But that cleanup process is complex and resource-intensive. The California Office of Emergency Services has already sent hazmat teams to inspect homes for lithium-ion batteries and flag where they’re present. The EPA has what it refers to as a battery recovery team that will oversee efforts to collect them. Chris Myers, a lithium-ion battery technical specialist involved in the EPA cleanup, said the collection process could start as early as Monday. “It is very likely that these batteries were not all consumed in the fire, so now they’re damaged, which means they’re all dangerous,” he said. Myers explained that the battery systems in hybrid and electric cars are well-protected, so even vehicles that were damaged by the fires may still have charged batteries. Handling the batteries “requires a great deal of technical sophistication and care,” Calanog said. The EPA team must wear flame-resistant clothing underneath disposable protective suits. Masks cover their faces, and either come with insertable cartridges to filter out chemicals or attach to air tanks. The crew blocks off the area where it’s working and keeps water on site in case flames erupt. Before they can be sent to a waste or recycling facility, the collected batteries must be de-energized so that they hold no charge or very little. To do that, Myers said, the EPA will likely use a process developed after the Maui wildfire in 2023, which involves submerging the batteries in a solution of saltwater and baking soda. Once the batteries have lost their charges, they can be crushed with a steamroller or shipped to a facility in special packaging. Lithium-ion batteries have become a mounting issue after wildfires, given the rising sales of hybrid and electric cars, particularly in California. The state will require 35% of new vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2026, and all new vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035. In Los Angeles County, at least 581,000 zero-emission vehicles — including plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars — were sold in the last 15 years, around 99,000 of which were sold in 2024, according to the California Energy Commission. In Pacific Palisades alone, more than 5,500 zero-emission vehicles were sold from 2010 to 2024. “There is a very large number of electric vehicles in this area — probably way more than in other areas,” said Adam VanGerpen, a public information officer for the Los Angeles City Fire Department. “A lot of these people also had solar roofs and solar batteries for the wall power banks.” Yuzhang Li, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at UCLA, said the riskiest batteries are those in cars that were partially burned, rather than fully destroyed. “If the electric vehicle has already caught on fire and been burnt out, then I would say the risk is relatively minimal, because presumably all of the fire has destroyed the battery,” he said. As authorities begin the enormous process of cleaning up from the Southern California fires, their first priority — which the EPA calls “phase one” — is to remove hazardous waste such as asbestos, batteries, oil and paint from properties, since the materials can release toxic fumes. The entire process could take about six months, Calanog said. Myers said the battery recovery process won’t slow down that timeline, though “the scale here is certainly a big challenge.” As for where to dispose of the hazardous waste, Calanog said the EPA has not decided yet, and a number of sites are available. However, VanGerpen said many facilities that receive hazardous waste are located outside California, and there may be limits to how much waste they’re willing to accept. The waste must be cleared before authorities can move on to the next phase of the cleanup: removing debris. VanGerpen urged residents to avoid sifting through rubble until their property has been deemed safe. “Residents should not go and try to remove hazardous debris,” he said. “Just your normal household items can be dangerous and pose a risk.” Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.

Hours later, the White House said Sunday that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to extend the deadline for Israeli troops to depart southern Lebanon until Feb. 18, after Israel requested more time to withdraw beyond the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement thathalted the Israel-Hezbollah warin late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish its presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it cannot deploy until Israeli forces withdraw. The White House said in a statement that “the arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, will continue to be in effect until February 18, 2025.” It added that the respective governments “will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after October 7, 2023.” There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government, but Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati confirmed the extension. The announcement came hours after demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter several villages to protest Israel’s failure to withdraw from southern Lebanon by the original Sunday deadline. The dead included six women and a Lebanese army soldier, the Health Ministry said in a statement. People were reported wounded in nearly 20 villages in the border area. The Israeli army blamed Hezbollah for stirring up Sunday’s protests. It said in a statement that its troops fired warning shots to “remove threats in a number of areas where suspects were identified approaching.” It added that a number of suspects in proximity to Israeli troops were apprehended and were being questioned. The development in Lebanon comes asIsrael kept thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homesin northern Gaza on Sunday, accusing Hamas of violatinga fragile ceasefireby changing the order of hostages it has released. Lebanese President Joseph Aounsaid in a statement addressing the people of southern Lebanon on Sunday that “Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, and I am following up on this issue at the highest levels to ensure your rights and dignity.” He urged them to “exercise self-restraint and trust in the Lebanese Armed Forces.” The Lebanese army, in a separate statement, said it was escorting civilians into some towns in the border area and called on residents to follow military instructions to ensure their safety. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whose Amal Movement party is allied with Hezbollah and who served as an interlocutor between the militant group and the U.S. during ceasefire negotiations, said that Sunday’s bloodshed “is a clear and urgent call for the international community to act immediately and compel Israel to withdraw from occupied Lebanese territories.” An Arabic-language spokesperson for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, posted on X that Hezbollah had sent “rioters” and is “trying to heat up the situation to cover up its situation and status in Lebanon and the Arab world.” He called Sunday morning for residents of the border area not to attempt to return to their villages. U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and the head of mission of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro, called in a joint statement for both Israel and Lebanon to comply with their obligations under the ceasefire agreement. “The fact is that the timelines envisaged in the November Understanding have not been met,” the statement said. “As seen tragically this morning, conditions are not yet in place for the safe return of citizens to their villages along the Blue Line.” UNIFIL said that further violence risks undermining the fragile security situation in the area and “prospects for stability ushered in by the cessation of hostilities and the formation of a government in Lebanon.” It called for the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops, the removal of unauthorized weapons and assets south of the Litani River, the redeployment of the Lebanese army in all of south Lebanon and ensuring the safe and dignified return of displaced civilians on both sides of the Blue Line. An AP team was stranded overnight at a UNIFIL base near Mays al-Jabal after the Israeli army erected roadblocks Saturday while they were joining a patrol by peacekeepers. The journalists reported hearing gunshots and booming sounds Sunday morning from the base, and peacekeepers said that dozens of protesters had gathered nearby. In the village of Aita al Shaab, families wandered over flattened concrete structures looking for remnants of the homes they left behind. No Israeli forces were present. “These are our houses,” said Hussein Bajouk, one of the returning residents. “However much they destroy, we will rebuild.” Bajouk added that he is convinced that former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs in September, is really still alive. “I don’t know how much we’re going to wait, another month or two months... but the Sayyed will come out and speak,” he said using an honorific for Nasrallah. On the other side of the border in the kibbutz of Manara, Orna Weinberg surveyed the devastation of the recent conflict on her neighbors and the Lebanese villages on the other side of the frontier. The sound of gunfire sporadically popped in the distance. “Unfortunately, we have no way of defending our own children without harming their children,” Weinberg, 58, said. “It’s a tragedy to all sides.” Some 112,000 Lebanese remaindisplaced, out of over 1 million who fled their homes during the war. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

A quirky and fascinating addition to Denmark’s natural history has been uncovered — a 66-million-year-old vomit fossil. Local fossil hunter Peter Bennicke found the fossil, officially named Danekræ DK-1295, at Stevns Klint in eastern Denmark. \"Danekræ\" are rare natural treasures of Denmark. They must be evaluated by the national Danekræ committee of the Natural History Museum of Denmark before they receive the designation, according to the University of Copenhagen and the National History Museum Denmark. Bennicke made the discovery after he noticed a strange collection of sea lily fragments embedded in chalkand to it to Geomuseum Faxe in November, said Jesper Milàn, museum curator at Geomuseum Faxe.After a cleaning and an analysis by Dutch sea lily expert John Jagt, it was determined that the clump contained remains from at least two species of sea lilies, the museum said. Regurgitalites, or fossilized vomit, are rare but invaluable to scientists studying ancient ecosystems, as they reveal what predators ate and how food chains functioned millions of years ago, the museum said. Milàn said a Cretaceous-era predator, possibly a fish, most likely consumed the sea lilies and later spat out the indigestible parts. “It is truly an unusual find. Sea lilies are not a particularly nutritious diet, as they mainly consist of calcareous plates held together by very few soft parts,\" Milàn said in a Østsjællands Museumnews release. Visitors can see the unusual relic of prehistoric dining habits during a special exhibition at the Geomuseum Faxe.

The sudden appearance of an advanced AI assistant from DeepSeek, a previously little-known company in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, has sparked discussion and debate within the U.S. tech industry about what it says about the broader AI development race. DeepSeek’s assistant hit No. 1 on the Apple App Store in recent days, and the AI models powering the assistant are already outperforming top U.S. models, with the company saying that they were made with a fraction of the resources. DeepSeekreleased its latest large language model, R1, a week ago. Second only to OpenAI’s o1 model in theArtificial Analysis Quality Index, a well-followed independent AI analysis ranking, R1 is already beating a range of other models including Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Meta’s Llama 3.3-70B and OpenAI’s GPT-4o. “DeepSeek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment,” entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, known for cowriting Mosaic, one of the world’s first web browsers,wrote Sunday on X, likening it to the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and the event that forced the U.S. to realize that its technological abilities were not unassailable. On Monday, DeepSeekreleased yet anotherAI model, Janus-Pro-7B, which is multimodal in that it can process various types of media including images. The company says it “surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models.” Tech stocks dropped sharply Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite declining 3.4% just minutes into the trading day. Big U.S. tech companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into AI technology. One of R1’s core competencies is its ability to explain its thinking throughchain-of-thought reasoning, which is intended to break complex tasks into smaller steps. This method enables the model to backtrack and revise earlier steps — mimicking human thinking — while allowing users to also follow its rationale. At last week’s World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella — whose company is one of OpenAI’s biggest investors — called DeepSeek’s new model “super impressive,” adding that he believes “we should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Both R1 and o1 are part of an emerging class of “reasoning” models meant to solve more complex problems than previous generations of AI models. But unlike OpenAI’s o1, DeepSeek’s R1 is free to use and open weight, meaning anyone can study and copy how it was made. R1 was based on DeepSeek’s previous model V3, which hadalso outscoredGPT-4o, Llama 3.3-70B and Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-72B, China’s previous leading AI model. Upon its release in late December, V3 was performing on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Part of what makes R1 so impressive are the claims from DeepSeek about its development. V3 took only two months and less than $6 million to build, according to a DeepSeektechnical report, even as leading tech companies in the United States continue to spend billions of dollars a year on AI. DeepSeek also had to navigate U.S. export restrictions that limited access to the best AI computing chips, forcing the company to build its models with less-powerful chips. It’s ignited a heated debate in American tech circles: How did a small Chinese company so dramatically surpass the best-funded players in the AI industry? And what does this mean for the field going forward? Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun wrote in aThreads postthat this development doesn’t mean China is “surpassing the US in AI,” but rather serves as evidence that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.” He added that DeepSeek benefited from other open-weight models, including some of Meta’s. “They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it,” LeCun wrote. “That is the power of open research and open source.” (Although many companies, including DeepSeek and Meta, claim their AI models are open source, they have not actually revealed their training data to the public.) OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also appeared to take a jab at DeepSeek last month, after some users noticed that V3 would occasionallyconfuse itself with ChatGPT. A day after V3’s Dec. 26 release, Altmanwrote on Xthat “it is (relatively) easy to copy something that you know works. it is extremely hard to do something new, risky, and difficult when you don’t know if it will work.” On Monday, Altman said the new R1 was “an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” hewrote on X. “We will pull up some releases.” “But mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission,” he added. Some figures online floated unsubstantiated claims that DeepSeek’s success is aChinese government “psyop,”or psychological operation,casting suspicionon the small team’s ability to “beat all of the top researchers in the world as a side project.” Soumith Chintala, a co-founder of PyTorch, the machine learning library developed by Meta AI, was among many this weekend who hit back at these allegations. “i’m comically impressed that people are coping on deepseek by spewing bizarre conspiracy theories — despite deepseek open-sourcing and writing some of the most detail oriented papers ever,” Chintalaposted on X. “read. replicate. compete. don’t be salty, just makes you look incompetent.” Others in the tech and investment spheres joined in on the praise, expressing excitement about the implications of DeepSeek’s success. “This is what makes the DeepSeek thing so funny. A bunch of grifters have been selling AI secret sauce for years — spooky mystery juice that could never be fully explained,” macroeconomist Philip Pilkingtonwrote on X. “Now a bunch of young guys just wrote a good algo, published it, and the circus tent burned down.” Nat Friedman, the former CEO of Github, similarlyposted: “The deepseek team is obviously really good. China is full of talented engineers. Every other take is cope. Sorry.” DeepSeek’s models tout bilingual proficiency, excelling in both Chinese and English. They do, however, appear subject to censorship or specific political leanings around topics deemed sensitive in China. When asked about the sovereignty of Taiwan, a self-ruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory, DeepSeek’s R1 sometimes states the subject is “beyond my current scope.” Other times, the model describes Taiwan as “an inalienable part of China’s territory,” adding: “We firmly oppose any form of ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities and are committed to achieving the complete reunification of the motherland through peaceful means.” Hot on the heels of DeepSeek’s latest models, other players in China’s tech sector are already rolling out new contenders in the race for AI dominance. Alibaba on Sundayintroducedits newest Qwen2.5-1M model, an upgrade from Qwen2.5-72B. Kimi AI, owned by the Beijing-based company Moonshot AI, alsoannouncedthe launch of its latest multimodal reasoning model Kimi k1.5 on Saturday, which it touts as comparable to OpenAI’s o1.

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A group of Quaker congregations is suing the Department of Homeland Security for changing a policy that prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from carrying out operations in so-called “sensitive locations” such as houses of worship, playgrounds, schools and hospitals without approval from supervisors. The policy, which had been in place under multiple administrations — including during President Donald Trump’s first term — was rescinded last week. The lawsuit, which was filed in federal district court in Maryland on Monday, alleges, “The very threat of that [immigration] enforcement deters congregants from attending services, especially members of immigrant communities,” and argues that attending religious services is at the heart of the “guarantee of religious liberty.” Faith leaders, local officials and educators have objected to the policy reversal and have been vocal about their opposition, but the suit appears to be the first from a faith-based organization challenging the change in court. “A week ago today, President Trump swore an oath to defend the Constitution and yet today religious institutions that have existed since the 1600s in our country are having to go to court to challenge what is a violation of every individual’s constitutional right to worship and associate freely,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is providing the lawyers representing the Quaker groups. Perryman said the lawsuit addresses more than churches that act as sanctuaries. “The troubling nature of the policy goes beyond just houses of worship with sanctuary programs — it is that ICE could enter religious and sacred spaces whenever it wants,” she said. Noah Merrill, secretary of the New England Yearly Meeting of Friends, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, told NBC News in an email:  \"Quaker meetings for worship seek to be a sanctuary and a refuge for all, and this new and invasive practice tangibly erodes that possibility by creating unnecessary anxiety, confusion, and chilling of our members’ and neighbors’ willingness to share with us in the worship which sustains our lives. This undermines our communities and, we believe, violates our religious freedom.\" According to the lawsuit, the policy that protected “sensitive locations” from immigration enforcement without prior approval dates back to the early 1990s. It was meant to allow undocumented people to operate freely in certain public areas with the idea that doing so would ultimately benefit not just them, but also the larger community — for example, by allowing children to be in school during the day, and letting sick people visit hospitals without fear of deportation. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are several regional umbrella groups representing Quaker congregations in the mid-Atlantic and New England. P.J. Lechleitner, who served as acting ICE director from July 2023 until last week, told NBC News on Monday that he does not expect ICE raids at houses of worship even with the end of the policy. “I don’t think you’re going to be seeing a lot of target operations … in churches or places of worship or schools or whatever,” he said, “unless there’s a real operational and public safety, national security, need to do so.” Laura Strickler is a senior investigative producer and reporter for NBC News.

Ed Martin, who became the acting head of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia after Trump was inaugurated, said he was appointing two officials to look at the use of an obstruction of justice charge, whichthe Supreme Court determined had been used too broadlyagainst some Jan. 6 defendants. Martin’s office disbanded the Justice Department’s Capitol Siege Section and moved to dismiss cases against violent Jan. 6 rioters who attacked police officers. He alsofiled a motionlast week that implored a judge to drop conditions that would have required some members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia group to getcourt permission before they visit Washingtonor the U.S. Capitol after Trump commuted their Jan. 6 sentences. Follow live politics coverage Martin wrote Monday that the two officials he selected would need to issue a preliminary report by Friday, and he asked all employees to pass along \"all files, documents, notes, emails and other information\" about the use of18 U.S. Code 1512, which prosecutors often refer to as the \"1512\" charge. Martin referred to the review as \"Project 1512\" and called it \"important work.\" “Obviously, the use was a great failure of our office — [Supreme Court] decision — and we need to get to the bottom of it,” Martin wrote in an email obtained by NBC News that also reminded U.S. attorney’s office workers of the hiring freeze and the Trump administration's steps ending “all DEI efforts.\" Before he joined the Trump administration, Martin was a “Stop the Steal” advocate who spoke at the Capitol on Jan. 5 and was on the Capitol grounds during the Jan. 6 riot. He also was on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for Jan. 6 defendants and held fundraisers at Trump’s properties. In addition, he was an attorney for at least three Jan. 6 defendants, and hespread conspiracy theories about the attack on the Capitol, falsely claiming that the riot was a setup staged by a person he dubbed \"Mr. Coffee.\" \"January 6th was Staged by Mr. Coffee 🔥,\"Martin wrote in 2023, referring to an unidentified man who helped set up a nonfunctioning gallows near the Capitol on Jan. 6. Martin was subpoenaedby the House Jan. 6 committee, which said it had evidence that he was \"involved in the logistical planning\" of Trump's \"Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6 and that he had “paid costs associated with vendors hired for that event.” In his speech at the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, Martin said he would fight until his “last breath” to “stop the steal.” “No matter what happens tomorrow or the next day or the day after, we still need to be in the fight. There’s no summer soldiers and springtime patriots here. There’s the die-hard true Americans,” Martin said at the time. “We start today, go through tomorrow and every day till we have a last breath and go home to the Lord, because we will stop the steal.” We’re looking to hear from federal government workers.

Former special counsel Jack Smith oversaw those two cases. Now that the Capitol Siege Section has been disbanded, some officials see Martin's \"special project\" as a sign that he's targeting some of the leadership of the unit that remains. “It definitely smells like he’s trying to force them out,” a Justice Department official said. A former Jan. 6 prosecutor said the investigation sounded like it would be \"totally frivolous\" and said it would \"divert resources\" within the office that could instead be used on keeping Washington safe by prosecuting crimes. \"This was not a charge that was chosen for political reasons,\" the former official said. \"It was brought by career prosecutors working with the FBI when the facts dictated that it was appropriate.\" Martin didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.

It is believed to be the first time that the militant group has said exactly how many hostages are dead or alive. Later, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said these numbers matched information gleaned by Israeli intelligence. The first three Israeli hostages —Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari, a dual British citizen— were freed earlier this month in exchange for 90 Palestinian detainees — mostly women and children. On Saturday, four female Israeli soldiers were released in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. The ceasefire’s first phase, which is set to run until early March,  includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second phase has yet to be fully negotiated. The fragile truce was placed in jeopardy Saturday after Israel prevented Palestinian civilians from moving back to their homes in northern Gaza. It said Hamas had violated the agreement because it had not released hostage Arbel Yehoud. Hamas also accused Israel of breaking the deal, but on Monday, Qatar, one of the leading mediators in the talks to bring an end to the fighting, said in a statement that Yehoud would be freed along with two other hostages before Friday. Three other captives are also set be released Saturday, and many in Israel are hopeful thatKfir Bibas, the youngest hostage still in captivity in the Gaza Strip, will be among those released. Kfirwas just shy of 9 months old when he was kidnapped during theHamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, along with his 5-year-old brother, Ariel, and his parents, Yarden and Shiri Bibas. He turned 2 earlier this month, having never known a birthday outside captivity. While all other child hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a one-week ceasefire in November 2023, the Bibas family never emerged from Gaza, and on one of the final days of the brief pause in fighting, Hamas said in a statement that the toddler had been killed in an Israeli airstrike along with his mom and brother. Around 250 people were taken hostage and 1,200 people were killed on Oct. 7. After Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza in response, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials in the enclave.

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump hassigned an executive orderseeking to circumvent federal and state laws dealing with California's water system in an effort to provide the southern part of the state with necessary water resources to fight wildfires. Almost immediately after the onset of therecent spate of wildfires in Los Angeles, \"firefighters were unable to fight the blaze due to dry hydrants, empty reservoirs, and inadequate water infrastructure,\" the executive order said. Trump's order said the wildfire disaster has affected the entire country and it's in the nation's \"interest to ensure that California has what it needs to prevent and fight these fires and others in the future.\" \"Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to provide Southern California with necessary water resources, notwithstanding actively harmful State or local policies,\" the order said. The order calls for \"overriding disastrous California policies\" and directs the heads of the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, Commerce, Interior and Agriculture to take measures to ensure Southern California has adequate water resources. It also specifically calls on the interior and commerce secretaries to immediately take action \"to override existing activities that unduly burden efforts to maximize water deliveries.\" The order calls for the Trump administration to take over thefederal Central Valley Projectin California, which is operated by the Bureau of Reclamation. The water system \"reduces flood risk for the Central Valley, and supplies valley domestic and industrial water. It also supplies water to major urban centers in the Greater Sacramento and San Francisco Bay areas\" and \"provides water to restore and protect fish and wildlife, and to enhance water quality,\" according to the bureau. The presidential action also threatens to cut off federal funding to the state, saying that it wants the Trump administration to end \"the subsidization of California's mismanagement.\" The order instructs the director of the Office of Management and Budget to review all funding for programs related to California's land and water management and disaster response. When asked for comment Monday, Newsom's office said the executive order's premise is \"false.\" \"Attempts to connect water management in Northern California to local wildfire fighting in Los Angeles have zero factual basis,\" said his deputy director of communications, Tara Gallegos. \"California continues to pump as much water as it did under the Trump administration’s policies, and water operations to move water south through the Delta have absolutely nothing to do with the local fire response in Los Angeles.\" Ahead of Trump's visit to California on Friday, Newsom said Trump's criticisms of the state's handling of its water amounted to misinformation. \"Maybe the president doesn’t know that there’s not a spigot that can be turned that can solve all the water problems that he alleges exist, that don’t exist when it comes to the state water project here in California,\" he said. Trumprepeated threats during his trip to Los Angelesto withhold federal aid to California over efforts to protect endangered fish calledthe delta smelt, suggesting that water was being prioritized for them — and issue that Newsom has said is unconnected to firefighting efforts. The top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee in Congress, Rep. Jared Huffman, of California, criticized Trump's executive order, saying in a statement, \"With the stroke of a pen, Trump has chosen to undermine critically important safeguards and a whole host of community needs regarding the largest and most complex water operations in the world.\" Huffman added that none of the policies outlined in the executive order \"will move even a single drop of extra water to communities devastated by these wildfires. The president should be focusing on convincing his allies in Congress to provide Los Angeles the assistance it desperately needs as soon as possible and free from conditions. Instead, he is doubling down on conditioning aid to California with unrelated demands.\" Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

        "content": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Following President Donald Trump's return to office, immigration enforcement operations have started to sweep through major U.S. cities. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 956 people on Sunday — the largest number of arrests on a single day by the Trump administration to date — bringing total ICE arrests since inauguration to at least 2,681 arrests. While the Trump administration has touted the crackdown as targeting criminals, there has been concern over law-abiding migrants and those with permits also being rounded up. Officials have not disclosed numbers differentiating migrants with criminal histories and those without that are in custody. Here are the major cities where arrests have unfolded: In Chicago, migrant arrest crackdowns took place on Sunday. Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan,told NBC Newsthat among the people arrested in Chicago, six were convicted of serious offenses, two were previously convicted of murder and aggravated sexual battery, and multiple others were gang members. Arrest efforts continued Monday. There are 10 separate teams of about 10 federal agents each fanned out across the city, a source familiar with the operations said Monday. Teams include officers from multiple federal agencies, not just ICE, the source said. Chicago is a sanctuary city which protects migrants seeking citizenship. Under those protections, cooperation between city police and immigration agents is prohibited,NBC Chicagoreported. Mayor Brandon Johnson confirmed in a statement on X thatChicago police were not involvedin the ICE activity. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CNN on Sunday he supports deporting people convicted of violent crimes, but disagrees with targeting those who follow the law, saying: “These are not people who are causing problems in our country, and what we need is a path to citizenship for them.” Immigrant rights groups and city officials have prepared for the crackdown, with campaigns publishing information for immigrants to know their rights in case of an arrest. The Los Angeles offices of Homeland Security Investigations and the DEA said they were working with partners to conduct law enforcement operations in accordance with the Trump administration’s immigration priorities. The offices sharedphotos of law enforcement agents in green garbtaking people into custody. The city council formally adopted a sanctuary city ordinance late last year which prohibits city resources or personnel from being used to aid in federal enforcement of immigration laws,NBC Los Angelesreported. ThePhoenix office of the DEAsaid Sunday it was working with the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security “with their immigration efforts,” sharing photos of officers in law enforcement vests. The DEA’s San Diego office alsoshared on X photos of agents arresting peopleon Sunday. On Sunday, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Rocky Mountain Field Division executed a search warrant at a makeshift club in Denver and arrested “numerous individuals” associated and connected with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, or TdA. Forty-nine people were inside the location at the time and ICE determined at least 41 were in the U.S. illegally. Raids also unfolded in Miami on Sunday. The ICE Miami office said that among those arrested wasa Nicaraguan nationalwho was being held at the Broward County Jail with pending charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, unlawful carry of concealed weapon, discharging a firearm in public and driving with a suspended license. AJamaican national was also arrestedon charges of possession of oxycodone, displaying a firearm during a felony offense and operating a vehicle without a valid license. The Homeland Security Investigation office in Miami shared on X photos showing agents detaining people. The office said the arrests were the result of “excellent collaboration” to enforce “U.S. immigration laws and ensuring the safety of our communities.” The DEA’s Atlanta office said Sunday it participated in an operation supporting the Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security and other federal law enforcement partners with “their immigration enforcement efforts” in Atlanta. Wilson Rogelio Velásquez Cruz, a Honduran immigrant, was arrested at Iglesia Fuente de Vida, a church in Tucker, his family told NBC affiliateWXIA of Atlanta. His family said agents went to his home first, then his church. His wife told the station that he arrived in the U.S. in 2022 with his wife and three children under a work permit while awaiting a pending asylum case, and that permit was valid for four more years. He had been issued an immigration GPS monitor and his arrest marked the first time he was detained since crossing the border. ICE conducted “targeted operations” in North Texas on Sunday, including in Dallas, Irving, Arlington, Fort Worth and Collin County that resulted in at least 84 people apprehended, an ICE official told NBC News. Many of them were targeted due to “varying degrees of criminality” in their background, the official said. Some of the apprehensions were “collateral” arrests — meaning people who happened to be where a targeted individual was located. It’s unclear how many of the 84 were collateral arrests. San Juan Mayor Miguel Romero acknowledged the implementation of Trump’s immigration executive order on Sunday, saying: “I would like to express my solidarity with all the families affected by these measures. Likewise, I would like to clarify that, up to this moment, I have not been officially notified by any federal authority about the details of the processes that are being carried out in our city.” He said that neither municipal police nor government entities under San Juan's jurisdiction are collaborating or supporting the operations. The mayor said San Juan will offer support and provide “orientation, citizenship classes and assistance to those who need it to ensure that their rights are respected and that due process of law is complied with. I have directed the Office of Immigrant Assistance to make available the necessary resources to maximize our efforts,” Romero also said. “Under my administration, San Juan will continue to be a place where diversity and inclusion are deeply valued,” he added.

It will be worth it in areas that can’t be set up with cell towers, or, more importantly, in areas where war or repressive governments, don’t allow unfiltered access to the internet.  This includes China, which bans or severely restricts all the major social media outlets and sites, from X to the NY Times and dozens more.If any ordinary cellphone can get access to the world, China will basically have to forbid sale of any cellphone the world enjoys: Apple, Samsung, Google etc.  That’s going to be hard to do in so many large countries & it’ll take so much manpower and vigilance that such an effort alone could be enough to restrict growth and even topple governments.Information wants to be free. If (when) China puts pressure on Musk to restrict Starlink signals over China to what the Chinese government approves, would it be technically feasible to do such restrictions over China & not over adjacent parts of the world?

It is “the people” who benefit from private employment! By all means, take the modern world’s benefits as they come up, but look to restore the private industry which provides most of the real income for individuals, to restore the quality of life in the community and lower the “cost of living”. A strong America is vitally needed to help balance a very disturbed and violent world!America’s economic success provides a shining example to those who are caught in a “race to the bottom”, which produces violent domestic cultures like in Haiti and Sudan. Manchurian Candidate Trojan included? Is this the equivalent of finding a USB on the ground outside your office building? Embedding a “back door” into Deepseek dl’s seems too good an opportunity for the Bosses to pass up. People are plugging these things in without a healthy level of paranoia, and that seems reckless. The AI business plans of Meta, Azure, Tesla, and Google just went up in smoke. Money will be made selling preloaded trainable deepseek models on home computers and laptops. Hardware is king. Software is free. Sorry but the US (and companies who bend the knee on production- and engineering- and home office-to the US) always wins.China makes it first and better, we steal it and privatize itChina steals it and makes it cheaper, we tariff it; regulate it; bottleneck itChina has no vertical intergration strategy that benefits that country as a whole; they are disjointed, government-apppeasing, flash-in-the-pan, localized tech wannabe/ follower/ sheepChina will never get Taiwan intact; Russia will never get Ukraine intact.China will always be a BRIC; Russia will always be G20;The US needs to merely stay-the-course on Mars First, Moon best, commercialization and consumerization of everything and everyone, individualism in the context of right-wing family/ anti-DEI, anti-GlobWarm, anti-immigration and All will be Well and Self-Actualized in to 2050. No need to Compete with the Future World’s 2nd-World. The full-size R1 is >670 billion parameters — you ain’t running that on your laptop. Although you could spend $6,000 USD on a couple NVidia Project DIGITS, quantized. [ asking ‘deepseek’ about the formation rate for fossil fuels on valid information about timescale and consumed/stored amount of energy: “Global fossil fuel consumption is approximately 160,000 TWh/year (as of 2023). This means:The natural formation rate of fossil fuels (0.09 TWh/year) is 1.75 million times slower than the current consumption rate.” and requested explanation on heat transmission to space with global warming:“Earth currently radiates approximately 1.74 million TWh/year of heat into space. With a 1°C increase in global average temperature, the heat radiation increases to 1.76 million TWh/year. At +5°C, the heat radiation reaches 1.84 million TWh/year. This increase in heat radiation is a natural response to higher temperatures, but it is not sufficient to offset the additional energy trapped by greenhouse gases, which contributes to global warming.” ] A classic case of a small team who are specifically picked and continually monitored/encouraged based on, 1/ Inherent capability (incorporating both “Vertical” and “Lateral” high performance thinkers).2/ High performance when working as a small team.3/ High levels of team desire to help reach the clearly stated goals and milestones.4/ Ongoing Quality Assurance  (PDCA loop)…….5/ Such as …. Continual improvement methodology……6/ Continual rewards/motivation schemes with ongoing monitoring/rectification for abusive bullying/coverups of poor performance.7/ A sensitive and inclusive, non-judgmental, management that supports/(does not abandon) useful workers.8/ Ongoing validation schemes/testing to ensure project trajectory/timeliness/ROI is maintained. impressive no doubt.The company with the most compute still wins.They will dissect this, figure it out, implement it themselves, and now with all their extra compute, be that much better.This is a win. So we could make huge parent model with particular specialization then distill it into small model that can run locally. Because computational requirements are low enough, we could apply it to every day tasks without any need to be connected to internet. From “intelligent” lawn mowers which dont need bunch of wires or too much computing power to smart home cameras, smart drones, robots,… Basically if I understand it correctly Chinese just showed that this is possible. You do not need to write specialized software for your particular product,… You just need specialized distilled LLM model, which can run well with low computation requirements. The panic is that they showed that even if you can pay for talent, paying a lot doesn’t mean you have a lot of talent. These guys cooked and did it well. I now laugh thinking about the half trillion boondoggle Sam Altman was salivating about building with crony capitalism, without knowing if that investment could get you a thousand Qwens instead. China has 1.4 billion population. Naturally they have some very smart people and they proved that partly brute forcing with raw computational power is not the only way to do it,….. Now others with more comp power will try to apply that to get better models for less comp costs. Comment ",

        "source": "https://www.nextbigfuture.com/",
        "content": "Home»Energy»Nextbigfuture Covered Nanonuclear Before it Went Up 10X to $1.6 Billion Value In March ,2024, Nextbigfuture started covering NANO Nuclear.It was then a startup that had raised over $8 million to develop micro nuclear fission reactors with up to 2 megawatts of power. The reactors will be transported by Semi Trucks. I, Brian Wang of Nextbigfuture, was contacted by the Nano Nuclear team for a correction that their initial nuclear fission reactors will be 1-2 megawatts of power. In May 2024, they announced the closing of a $10.2 million public offering (IPO).They started trading at about $4 per share and a $150 million valuation. They have since increased to $44 per share and a $1.6 billion valuation. They have become a unicorn. In July 2024, they had an upsized underwritten offering at $20 per share. I published an interview with the CEO of Nanonuclear. James Walker is the CEO and a board member of Nano Nuclear Energy Inc. (NANO Nuclear). He is a nuclear engineer with over 15 years of experience in project management.  They plan to sell 1,000 microreactors on a yearly basis for a trillion-dollar industry. The products are ZEUS which is a solid core battery reactor and ODIN, a low-pressure coolant reactor, each representing advanced developments in portable, on-demand capable. The Zeus nuclear microreactor is engineered for safe operation in remote locations. Its ‘walk-away safe’ feature ensures stability and safety, minimizing risks in varied environments. This aspect is critical for ensuring consistent operation without the need for active intervention. Portability and Adaptability: The modular components fit within standard shipping containers, facilitating transportation to remote sites. This feature enhances its utility in areas where traditional energy infrastructure is not feasible. In December, 2024, Nextbigfuture covered NANO Nuclear Space (NNS).They will focus on optimizing “ZEUS”, a solid core battery reactor, and “ODIN”, a low-pressure coolant reactor, for applications such as power systems for extraterrestrial projects and human sustaining environments, and potentially propulsion technology for long haul space missions. NNS’ initial focus will be on cis-lunar applications, referring to uses in the space region extending from Earth to the area surrounding the Moon’s surface.  In December, 2024, Nextbigfuture covered Nanonuclear acquiring the reactor technology of Ultrasafe nuclear. They executed a definitive agreement to acquire select nuclear energy technology assets from Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. The acquired assets include USNC’s patented Micro Modular Reactor (MMR) system, along with all associated patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as its Pylon reactor technology and related intellectual property, and certain demonstration project partnerships related to the MMR system. The assets are being acquired for $8.5 million in cash through an auction process conducted pursuant to Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in connection with USNC’s pending Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The deal is expected to occur in the near future subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions in a bankruptcy proceeding. The MMR® Energy System is a zero-carbon nuclear power plant, integrating one or several standardized micro reactors with a heat storage unit and the adjacent plant for power conversion and utilization. The system, which is under development, could be used to provide carbon-free, high-quality process heat for co-located industrial applications, and for high-efficiency hydrogen production. The MMR Energy System compliments NANO Nuclear’s own ‘ZEUS’ and “ODIN’ microreactors in development. However, whereas ‘ZEUS’ and “ODIN’ are being designed to be portable and produce 1 to 1.5 megawatts thermal (“MWth”) of power, the MMR Energy System is stationary and designed to produce power up to 45 MWth, opening additional potential markets to NANO Nuclear. The MMR Energy System is being demonstrated at the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories with Ontario Power Generation and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was also the first small modular reactor to enter the formal licensing review phase with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.    The Pylon reactor is a compact nuclear reactor designed for versatility in application and deployment. It is designed to provide between 1 MWth and 5MWth of power and can be integrated with modular balance of plants tailored to specific applications including remote terrestrial, marine, and space deployments. The Pylon reactor is scheduled to be demonstrated at the Idaho National Laboratory’s DOME facility by 2027, following USNC’s selection for the National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC) Front-End Engineering program.

Their MO becomes apparent reading Nano’s “Management and Staff” page: As CFO, John oversaw all financial matters for the Department of Energy. He was also appointed by the President as Acting Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)… Dr. Norato recently retired from INL, where he served as a Senior Advisor for Research Operations and Strategic Projects… Mr. Tiktinsky previously had 39 years of licensing and project management experience working for the NRC. Mr. Oesterle previously had over 38 years of licensing, regulatory, project management, engineering, industrial and construction experience primarily in the nuclear power industry and at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Mr. Chow has served as Senior Advisor to the U.S. Department of Energy on East Asia, where he implemented two US-China Agreements on clean energy between Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao… Either they figure their government experience will lube the gears, or this is the typical revolving door insider treatment we hear about. This is just going to increase cynicism. It really is Wallstreetbets and nukebro bag holders.  Imagine picking this over Westinghouse eVinci (DOE grant driven). I have to say I did not see the nuclear pump and dump coming. I certainly would never have put my hard-earned money into something like this.  Bravo to the Kings and sympathies to those that eventually lose. The significance of eVinci being “grant driven” is that Westinghouse wouldn’t develop it otherwise.  Here is a comparative allegory: Back in 2012 when the 200 engineers, Westinghouse pulled the plug on their integral PWR concept, stating that they could license it and build it, but nobody would buy it.  Westinghouse was going to use a similar straight tube steam generator as the eMpower, but operate it saturated (flooded, bulk boiling) and take the boiling water off to a steam drum, like was done in some early reactors.  To this day Westinghouse periodically mentions that they will sell you a single steam generator ap1000, the ap300, if any customer wants it. They feel it would be trivial to license. But the concept is out there if these GE BWRX300s or NuScale start taking firm orders. some kind of ‘on-the-fly’ redaction removed information regarding mention of the BeeDoubleYouExTee emmP0wer that had staffed-up to 200 engineers and a hundred million per year payroll at the time Westinghouse pulled plug on their SMR. It’s hard to find the required regulatory pathway for this in US/Canada/UK. There are at least some timeline/ milestone papers with legacy refurbushments past decade, same site upgrades, and various 20-Yr old tech new builds… I really hope nuclear plays a big role going forward, it’s the best source of virtually infinite 24/7 power.  Smaller reactors like this are the clear path forward, where they can be built on an assembly line, finally making it an affordable power option. in the article, it is stated that:“The MMR Energy System is being demonstrated at the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories with Ontario Power Generation and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.” But from the homepage of the University of Illinois Urbana-champaign: “The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, through the Department of Nuclear, Plasma & Radiological Engineering, is in the process of applying for a license to construct and operate a new research reactor on campus.” So, it does not seem that a demonstrator has been built there yet.

The 🐋 is cookin'pic.twitter.com/yCmDQoke0f — Rowan Cheung (@rowancheung)January 27, 2025  Here is the Huggingface area for DeepSeek Janus Pro 7B. Janus-Pro is a novel autoregressive framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation. It addresses the limitations of previous approaches by decoupling visual encoding into separate pathways, while still utilizing a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder’s roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework’s flexibility. Janus-Pro surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. The simplicity, high flexibility, and effectiveness of Janus-Pro make it a strong candidate for next-generation unified multimodal models. Model Summary Janus-Pro is a unified understanding and generation MLLM, which decouples visual encoding for multimodal understanding and generation. Janus-Pro is constructed based on the DeepSeek-LLM-1.5b-base/DeepSeek-LLM-7b-base. For multimodal understanding, it uses the SigLIP-L as the vision encoder, which supports 384 x 384 image input. For image generation, Janus-Pro uses the tokenizer from here with a downsample rate of 16. Brian Wang is a Futurist Thought Leader and a popular Science blogger with 1 million readers per month.

Not to mention simple things like waiting at red lights. Install few cameras with image recognition, model which is smart enough to run, understand what it needs to do and using safeguards not to have multiple green lights at the same time,… So much time could be saved, when you need to wait before red light and nobody is there, not to mention other inefficiencies. This kind of models are even not specialized for particular task. More broad knowledge, which expands with more parameters. For lots of programmers days are numbered.– The models will get better.– The distilled version of models will become more specialized for particular task, dont need all that broad knowledge for one task.– There wont be so much need for writing software for particular product, just add distilled specialized version of it and it will be smart enough to do it well.– More specialized hardware to low that low end local models. For example robot patrolling one area doesnt need knowledge of wikipedia or everything. It needs to be smart enough and good at few tasks.Same for robotic lawn mowers and many other examples. At least this is my opinion and take on it. You know, if this were Grok, I’d be excited. But  in light of “DeepSeek Model Has Restrictions and Bias”, my joy in finding that I could run a Chinese political commissar on my son’s Raspberry Pi leaves me unmoved. Let’s hope less compromised AIs achieve this kind of efficiency. Ultimately every retail computer will come with AI preinstalled.  Personally I’d rather it run on Linux.  An essential feature will be how to retrain the AI on personal data. Yay, now the OS will be 10GB.  We need more bloat! Comment ",

Keiko resurfaces near a Norwegian fishing village, causing a stir among the residents — and his own team. Subscribe to The Timesto access all episodes. In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try. Keiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach. “The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.

From the powerful forces shaping our public schools to a mystery at the heart of a scandal that rocked Britain, Serial expands the boundaries of audio investigative storytelling.Learn more Advertisement",

        "content": "Advertisement We independently review everything we recommend. When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.Learn more› BySabine Heinlein Sabine Heinlein is a writer covering floor care. Keeping her multi-pet home clean is one of her more acceptable obsessions. After a new round of testing, we’re updating and adding picks to this guide. TheDyson V12remains our top pick. If you deal with frequent small messes, or if you hate lugging out your full-size, plug-in vacuum cleaner, a cordless stick vacuum could be your dream cleaning partner. But like a good marriage, using a cordless stick vacuum requires you to make some compromises. We’ve tested dozens of them, and the perfect model just doesn’t exist. Depending on your priorities, we recommend theDyson V12 Detect Slimand theRyobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar. If you’re on a tight budget (and willing to overlook some red flags), consider theKenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095. This nimble, high-tech model is light, powerful, and easy to maneuver. But it doesn’t stand up on its own, and its dustbin is small. You save $100 (22%) This sturdy, versatile vacuum has several useful attachments and a large dustbin. It stands on its own and recharges quickly, but it’s heavier and less agile. This model is cheap, lightweight, and agile, and it cleans a variety of floor types well. But its non-replaceable battery and one-year warranty are disappointing. We’ve tested hundreds of vacuums over more than a decade, most recently evaluating 25 cordless stick models priced from $100 to $1,000. We measured how much baking soda, cereal, birdseed, glitter, and hair each vac pulled from four types of rugs and bare floors. We looked for cordless stick vacuums with at least a two-year warranty, as well as a replaceable battery—a major plus. We considered how easy and comfortable it was to maneuver each vacuum, and whether its attachments fit their purpose. This nimble, high-tech model is light, powerful, and easy to maneuver. But it doesn’t stand up on its own, and its dustbin is small. You save $100 (22%) TheDyson V12 Detect Slimcomes closer to an ideal stick vac than any model we’ve tested. It’s light and nimble around furniture and on stairs, and it even works on shelves, walls, and ceilings. The V12 Detect Slim rivals more expensive vacuums (such as the Dyson V15) in suction, airflow, and cleaning power, and it comes with multiple brushes and attachments, including a motorized brush for pet hair. It runs for 45 minutes on a single charge, longer than most of the other vacuums we’ve tested. It has high-tech features that make it almost fun to use, including a sensor that automatically adjusts suction, a laser headlight that illuminates dust in dim corners, and an LCD screen with a battery countdown and other information. It’s also one of the quietest models we’ve tested. The biggest downside of the V12 Detect Slim is its tiny, 12-ounce dustbin, which requires frequent emptying. You also have to swap between two different brushes depending on whether you use it on carpet or bare floor. It takes four hours to recharge—longer than most other models—and doesn’t stand up on its own. Dyson covers it with a two-year warranty. Advertisement This sturdy, versatile vacuum has several useful attachments and a large dustbin. It stands on its own and recharges quickly, but it’s heavier and less agile. Note: TheRyobi One+ 18V Brushless Cordless Advanced Whisper Series Stick Vacuum Kit, an updated version of the discontinued Ryobi model we currently recommend, will be our pick for people who want a heavy-duty cordless stick vacuum. We will update this guide soon. TheRyobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Baris a well-rounded workhorse, though it’s heavy and harder to maneuver on stairs. In our tests, it offered outstanding performance, picking up debris particles of different sizes and weights on all types of floors. Its large, 27-ounce dustbin, which is more than double the size of our other top pick’s bin, won’t quickly fill up with debris or fur. Its motorized cleaner head works equally well on bare floors and carpet (you don’t have to swap brushes, as with the Dyson V12 Detect Slim), and it comes with a variety of useful attachments, including a motorized brush for pet hair and a surprisingly useful micro crevice tool for tight cracks. The vacuum stands upright on its own and runs for about 35 minutes. The battery charges in two hours (one of the fastest charge times we saw in our tests) and is compatible with a variety of Ryobi tools. The Ryobi 18V One+ HP kit (which includes the battery and charger) is sold only through Home Depot and has gone out of stock at times, sometimes for several days or weeks. This model has a three-year warranty—longer than the coverage on most other stick vacs we’ve tested. This model is cheap, lightweight, and agile, and it cleans a variety of floor types well. But its non-replaceable battery and one-year warranty are disappointing. Most cordless stick vacuums that cost less than $200 are terrible. TheKenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095is a rare exception, but it still makes major trade-offs. We found that it’s a superb cleaner on both rugs and bare floors, picking up fur and debris almost as effectively as our top picks. This lightweight model cleverly folds in half for easier cleaning under furniture, and it has an extra-large, 33-ounce dustbin. It offers a solid 38-minute run time and recharges in four hours, similar to the Dyson V12 Detect Slim. It lacks the convenient, versatile attachments that our top picks have for cleaning fur off upholstery, dusting shelves, or reaching into crannies. But its biggest drawbacks are its weak one-year warranty and non-replaceable battery. Advertisement Staff writer Sabine Heinlein has been a journalist for over two decades. With a menagerie of rabbits and cats, she obsesses over how different types of fur adhere to upholstery andhow to remove hairballs from heirloom rugs. Liam McCabe wrote the previous versions of this guide, testing more than a hundred vacuums for this and othervacuum guides. For this guide: At their best, cordless stick vacuums are versatile, shape-shifting creatures that transform into different configurations with the help of useful attachments. They promise to clean everywhere, all at once, untethered by cords. Most cordless models are lithe and comfortable to use, even in cramped spaces or on stairs. Because cordless vacuums are compact and often packaged with either a wall-mountable charging dock or a floor stand, it’s common to store them within arm’s reach in plain sight. But even the priciest cordless stick vacuum can’t match the suction and deep-cleaning power of a goodupright or canister vacuum, especially if you have wall-to-wall carpeting, lots of rugs, or shedding pets. Their batteries typically last 30 to 40 minutes on a full charge, enough to clean a room or two but unlikely to tackle your whole home top to bottom. Cordless stick vacuums also have a shorter life expectancy than good plug-in vacuums. For most people, a cordless stick vac should be a sidekick to a plug-in vacuum. Advertisement In our most recent round of testing, we tried 25 cordless stick vacuums. Here’s how we evaluated them: We first measured each vacuum’s airflow with ananemometerand evaluated its suction with aspecialized suction gauge. You need high airflow because suction alone can’t move debris up the wand and into the bin, explained James Brown, service specialist and museum curator atMr. Vacuum Cleaner. “If I put a penny on my hand, put the nozzle over the penny, switched the machine on, switched it off and let it wind down, the penny would still be there because there’s no air moving down the tube to take it to where it needs to go. But you can still feel the pressure of it pulling your hand to the nozzle.” We paid special attention to each cleaner head, ruling out models without a motorized brush roll, because suction and airflow alone can’t remove dirt. “You need agitation, which is what the brushes do,” explained Brown. “They vibrate and sweep the carpet and dislodge the dirt. The airflow takes it away.” We also preferred models from which we could easily remove the brush roll for detangling and cleaning without special tools. We then tried each vacuum on different types of rugs and on bare floors strewn with Cheerios, fur, baking soda, birdseed, and glitter. We looked for models that didn’t snowplow (when a vacuum’s low-riding cleaner head pushes around heavier debris instead of sucking it up), dump (when debris falls back out of a vacuum that’s turned off), or jam (when the motorized brush seizes on certain types of rugs and rug pads). We also checked each model’s anti-tangling technology by vacuuming up colorful hair extensions. We then ran the top performers in a multi-person, multi-pet, multi-rug home for several weeks to see how they handled a variety of surfaces and messes (cat and bunny litter included). We tested the comfort and maneuverability of each vacuum. To measure the performance of above-floor attachments, we tried them in a dirty car, a sewing room, and a laundry room, as well as on different types of upholstery. We also examined other sources of delight or dismay, including the dustbin emptying process, the vacuum’s ability to stand up on its own, and the presence of any extras such as a headlight or an LCD screen. We also measured each vacuum’s noise level with theSPLnFFT app. Several company spokespeople told us that advertised run time is typically measured on a vacuum’s low power setting in handheld mode. That number rarely holds up in real life: Running a cordless stick vacuum’s motorized brush on bare floors and rugs draws more power and depletes its battery faster. We considered anything over 30 minutes an acceptable real-life run time. We looked for batteries that charged within four hours or less, and we considered it a plus if a vacuum’s run time exceeded 30 minutes and its battery could also work in a variety of tools from the same company. In addition to suffering from battery failure on occasion, cordless stick vacs are prone to the same clogs, cracked plastic, and other mechanical failures as plug-in machines. We combed through owner reviews provided by an AI-assisted analysis service calledFindOurViewto pinpoint obvious design flaws or quality-control issues. We called customer service for each of our top performers to experience the process and to determine how easy it was to order new parts. We favored models with a warranty of more than two years. Damian Lee, a former engineer at Dyson and Shark, agreed that a long warranty is meaningful when you’re making a buying decision: “[It] gives you confidence that a company is standing behind their product.” Most cordless stick vacuums have HEPA filters, but the existence of such a filter wasn’t a major factor in our decision-making. Even with a HEPA filter, a cordless stick vac is likely to expose you to dust and other allergens when you empty the bin. If you have serious allergies or asthma, you’re better off with avacuum that collects debris in a self-sealing, disposable bag. This nimble, high-tech model is light, powerful, and easy to maneuver. But it doesn’t stand up on its own, and its dustbin is small. You save $100 (22%) Of all the models we’ve tested, the nimble and powerfulDyson V12 Detect Slimcomes closest to being the ideal cordless stick vacuum. It’s lithe and graceful.Weighing just over 5 pounds, the V12 Detect Slim maneuvers easily in awkward spaces and on stairs. Though most of its weight sits on top, we found the V12 Detect Slim comfortable for our hands and wrists. Its cleaner head swivels 180 degrees, allowing it to reach into tight corners, around table legs, and between furniture better than other vacuums we’ve tested. It’s also very quiet (73 dB) compared with other models. Whereas previous Dyson models featured an uncomfortable trigger-style switch that you needed to squeeze for operation, the V12 Detect Slim has an on/off button. It sucks (in a good way).The V12 Detect Slim offers powerful suction and airflow, and it excels at picking up dust and debris on both bare floors and rugs. In our controlled rug-cleaning test, it devoured almost 100% of the baking soda we had spread out on medium-pile rugs—a clear sign that it is capable of targeting deeper-sitting dust and dander that other cordless sticks might miss. (One competitor picked up only a bit over 40%.) It also extracted fur from rugs well. The V12 Detect Slim has three suction modes: eco (lower suction, which conserves battery), boost (stronger suction), and auto. The auto mode is particularly helpful, as the dust sensor detects dirt and triggers increased suction power when necessary; for example, in our tests the V12 Detect Slim regularly went into boost mode near a cat litter box. It has two effective cleaner heads for different types of flooring.Designed to deep-clean rugs and carpet, the V12’s Motorbar cleaner head has tooth-like rubber vanes that, Dyson claims, automatically clear wrapped hair during cleaning. In our testing, the head readily captured 6-inch strands of hair, but the brush was less effective with 18-inch-long hair. (You can remove the brush, and you can cut off long lockswith scissors or a box cutter.) On bare floors, the Motorbar head efficiently cleaned baking soda and seeds, but it tended to snowplow Cheerios. The second cleaner head, the Laser Slim Fluffy, is made of soft microfiber fabric and is specifically designed to snag dust and fur from bare floors. It features a laser light that spookily illuminates dark corners—one moment the dust is spotlighted, the next it’s gone. In our testing, we found that the Fluffy head picked up larger debris that the Motorbar head tended to snowplow. The Fluffy head swallowed everything we presented it with, aside from a large mound of Cheerios (which it choked on) and a huge cockroach (which got stuck in the brush housing). It converts to a handheld vacuum with useful attachments.The V12 Detect Slim easily converts into a handheld vacuum and comes with helpful attachments for tasks around the home and in the car. Its mini motorized brush tool was one of the best we tested for removing pet hair from couches, cat beds, and car upholstery. Its combination tool allowed for quick switching between a wide nozzle and a brush; we found the brush particularly handy for dusting bookshelves and windowsills. It has a decent warranty, and its battery and many of its parts are replaceable.Dyson’s two-year warranty on this model is decent, though that’s less coverage time than we’ve seen for many other high-performing cordless sticks. The V12 Detect Slim uses swappable, click-in batteries, and you can buyspare packsto extend the run time—though we’ve noticed that they are routinely out of stock on the website. (Often you can still get them by calling the company. Or you can find cheaper knockoff batteries, butwe don’t recommend them.) The battery is one of the most common failure points on cordless stick vacuums, so Dyson’s swappable design means you won’t have to toss the whole vacuum if the battery goes bad. Many of itsother parts, including its washable filter, are replaceable, as well. It has cool features.The V12 Detect Slim’s LCD screen shows animated maintenance reminders, troubleshooting tips, and, most important, a battery-life countdown. Its chief gimmick is its particle counter, which estimates the number of differently sized particles collected and displays the tallies in a bar graph—supposedly to help you feel confident that you’vedeep-cleanedyour flooring. We don’t know how accurate or useful the particle counter is, but it can be a fun motivator. Advertisement In general, Dyson is a reliable brand with a well-earned and particularly devoted following. If the Dyson V12 Detect Slim isn’t for you, the Dyson line includes other options (although they come with triggers). We reviewedtheGen5detectand it is a great cleaner that is equipped with a couple of meaningful upgrades, like a suction bleed valve, a longer runtime, and a (relatively) large dustbin that is twice the size of the V12’s. But it is heavier than the V12 and feels less comfortable and less convenient to maneuver and store than its smaller cousin. TheV15 Detect’s dustbin is also twice the size of the V12 Detect Slim’s bin. Even though the V15 Detect’s motor has more muscle, it did not clean significantly better than the V12 Detect Slim in our tests. TheV8 Absoluteis less powerful than the V12 Detect Slim and the V15 Detect, but it’s still a good value. Its bin capacity lies between that of the other two models, and it comes with many useful attachments. TheOutsize Plushas a wider brush and an even larger bin than the V15 Detect, but its motor is slightly less powerful. This sturdy, versatile vacuum has several useful attachments and a large dustbin. It stands on its own and recharges quickly, but it’s heavier and less agile. Note: TheRyobi One+ 18V Brushless Cordless Advanced Whisper Series Stick Vacuum Kit, an updated version of the discontinued Ryobi model we currently recommend, will be our pick for people who want a heavy-duty cordless stick vacuum. We will update this guide soon. TheRyobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Barisn’t as lightweight, nimble, or snazzy as the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, but it stands out in several ways—and it costs much less. It’s an excellent cleaner.In suction and airflow, the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum performs almost as well as its most powerful competitors. We tried it on rugs, bare floors, car seats, and upholstery, and it did an excellent job of picking up all kinds of debris. In our baking-soda cleaning test, this Ryobi model extracted 96% of the debris—nearly as much as theDyson V12 Detect Slimpicked up. The Ryobi 18V One+ HP vac has two cleaning modes, eco and boost. We found that eco worked fine for most surfaces and dirt—and it saved battery life—but we also appreciated boost mode when confronted with a dry, set-in hairball in a Tibetan rug. Its all-in-one cleaner head is effective on a variety of surfaces.In contrast to our pick from Dyson, this Ryobi model has a headlight on its single cleaner head, with a plush roll in the front for bare floors and a stiff-bristled brush in the back for rugs. Unlike with the V12 Detect Slim, you don’t have to swap between cleaner heads to optimize this vacuum’s cleaning performance. In our tests, it was equally effective at picking up Cheerios on slippery tiles and pet fur on a medium-pile rug. Despite the cleaner head’s size—about double that of the V12 Detect Slim’s Motorbar—it swivels smoothly around corners and furniture. With the help of a quarter, you can easily remove the brush rolls from the cleaner head to clear tangled hair. It has an extra-large dustbin.The dustbin of the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum holds 27 ounces—more than twice the capacity of the bin in the V12 Detect Slim. Emptying the dustbin is easy, and you can clean and replace the filter. It has an okay run time, and it charges especially quickly.This model runs for about 35 minutes in eco mode, enough time to vacuum a small or medium-size apartment and plenty of time for quick cleanups. Its battery recharges in under two hours—faster than that of any other vacuum we tested in our latest round. The battery has a helpful charge-level indicator light. It stands on its own.The vacuum stands unsupported, so no need to scramble to find a place to prop it up if you get pulled away. It morphs into a handheld vacuum and has useful attachments.The Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum easily transforms into a handheld vacuum, and its attachments are versatile and better designed than those of other models we’ve tested. In our experience, the crevice tool and pivoting brush worked great in a car’s tight storage compartments, and the motorized mini brush was one of the few tested tools that made a dent in the thick layer of fur on a car’s clingy trunk upholstery. This Ryobi vacuum also includes a micro crevice tool with thin, flexible straws that we found ideal for cleaning the interior of a dusty sewing machine and a dryer vent. It has a generous warranty and replaceable parts. Ryobi’s three-year warranty on this model is longer than the coverage on most other stick vacuums, including Dyson’s. (Of all the cordless stick vacs we’ve tested, only theShark modelshave longer warranties, but those are considerably more expensive.) This Ryobi stick vac is made from thick plastic and metal, and it feels sturdier in construction than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim. Its battery and most of itsparts and accessoriesare replaceable. The battery is compatible with many othercordless Ryobi tools. Advertisement This model is cheap, lightweight, and agile, and it cleans a variety of floor types well. But its non-replaceable battery and one-year warranty are disappointing. We tested four cordless stick vacuums under $200, and all of them were terrible, with the exception of theKenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095. It’s the only cheap cordless stick vacuum we’ve considered recommending—and we’re doing so with major caveats. It’s a powerful cleaner, with an excellent brush roll.The DS4095’s ability to effectively pick up fur and debris doesn’t quite match that of the Dyson V12 Detect Slim. But a Wirecutter staffer who has been using it several times a week for the last six months to pick up fur and debris says it hasn’t lost any of its cleaning power. It has a big dustbin.This model’s 33-ounce dustbin is much larger than those of our picks. In our tests, we were able to vacuum a fur-ridden 650-square-foot space without having to empty the dustbin once. It’s cheap.The DS4095 typically costs nearly a quarter of the V12 Detect Slim. It’s lightweight.Weighing less than 6 pounds—about as much as theDyson V12 Detect Slimand considerably less than the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum—the DS4095 feels almost buoyant to use. It’s foldable.The wand folds in half with the click of a button, a feat that proved helpful when we were rounding up dust bunnies from under the couch. It has a decent run time.The DS4095 has a real-life run time of 38 minutes—shorter than that of the Dyson V12 Detect Slim (45 minutes), but a bit longer than that of theRyobi 18V One+ HP vac(35 minutes). It recharges in four hours, which is standard. It’s also the quietest stick vac we tested (68 dB) in our latest round. If you’re a Miele devotee:You might like theMiele Triflex HX2 Cat & Dog. This model, which cleans about as well as our picks, is beautifully designed, nimble, and a pleasure to maneuver. It can work in three configurations: as a handheld vacuum cleaner, with the bin and motor (the heaviest part) below the handle, or with the bin and motor directly above the cleaner head. (We found the last configuration to be the best.) But it’s expensive, priced around $740 at this writing. Its cleaner head jammed easily on certain rug and rug pad combinations in our tests, and we found opening the dustbin to be a hassle. On top of all that, its 25-minute real-life run time and two-year warranty are disappointing. If you frequently vacuum up long hair:Consider theShark IZ862H Stratos Cordless Vacuum. It’s the only stick vacuum in our test group whose brush was able to handle 18-inch-long hair without requiring us to manually untangle it. This model is an excellent cleaner with an impressive five-year warranty. But we didn’t like the strong, artificial smell of its odor-neutralizing cartridge. The manual advises to avoid direct contact with the fragrance pod and to keep it away from children and pets, and Shark wouldn’t give us information about its ingredients. Advertisement We found theDyson V15s Detect Submarinewet-and-dry vacuum cleaner to be heavy, awkward, and, at nearly $1,000, ridiculously pricey. Like theV15 Detect—its much lighter, vacuum-only cousin—this model has a trigger instead of a button. Its mopping performance pales in comparison to an old-fashioned mop; it’s also leaky, and its five separate parts need to be painstakingly disassembled to be cleaned. TheTineco Pure One S11was our previous top pick, and we still think it’s a decent stick vacuum. But our current picks are better cleaners. We also tested the newTineco Pure One S15 Petand theTineco Pure One Air, its lighter, less powerful cousin, but both models allowed heavier debris to drop back out when we shut them off. Tineco’s product team told us that they were working to improve the issue. The priceySamsung Bespoke Jetcomes with a freestanding (and bulky) charging and auto-emptying station. But when we tested this model, it wasn’t any better than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim or the Ryobi 18V One+ HP vacuum. Although theHoover OnePwr Emerge Pet+is similar in looks and performance to the Ryobi 18V One+ HP model, it costs more, has a smaller dustbin, and runs for a meager 25 minutes. We also tried theHoover OnePwr Evolve Pet Elite, but we found it to be less versatile than the Emerge Pet+ because it lacked attachments for cleaning shelves, stairs, and ceilings. In addition, we were unable to disassemble the Evolve Pet Elite for storage after using it because its stick wouldn’t detach from its body. (We ran into a similar problem with theBissell ICONpet Turbo Edge: After we emptied its bin, reinserting the bin was impossible.) For its price, around $350 at the time of our testing, theElectrolux WellQ7felt flimsy. It was a worse cleaner than our picks, too. Several contenders—including theGreenworks 24V Cordless Green Stick Vacuumand theFabuletta FSV001 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner—had cool LED displays or LCD screens but were incapable of sucking up and holding in debris effectively. In our tests, theDreametech T30 Cordless Vacuum Cleaneremitted a high-pitched whine and struggled to pick up medium and large debris. Its uncharacteristically long wand may make it awkward to use for shorter people. TheBlack+Decker PowerSeries+ 16V Max Cordless Stick Vacuumsnowplowed debris and dumped some back out once we switched it off. TheShark Wandvac Self-Empty Systemcomes bundled with an auto-emptying station, which in our testing failed to extract all of the debris from the vacuum’s teeny dustbin. Emptying the dustbin manually was awkward and easily led to spills. We plan to test several new cordless stick vacuums next: TheTineco Pure One Station Furfree Smart Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaneris advertised as a hands-free self-cleaning unit that empties its dustbin and cleans its brush roll and filters automatically, and theLG CordZero All in One Cordless Stick Vacuumempties its dustbin into a bag at its docking station. We are also curious how theRyobi 18V ONE+ HP Advanced Stick Vacuum Kitand theRyobi 18V ONE+ HP High-Capacity Stick Vacuum Kitcompare to our currentRyobi pick. The former is advertised as Ryobi’s most powerful and quietest stick vac. The latter carries its weight on the bottom of the vacuum versus below the hand. Both models come with a generous 34-ounce dustbin, larger even than that of our pick. Advertisement Vacuum owners often think that their machine is broken when all it needs is a cleaning. Cordless stick vacuums are sold on the convenience of not needing bags, but they do require regular maintenance. “The number one problem is that people buy [cordless stick] vacuums, but they never clean the filter,” said vacuum repair specialist and collector Tom Gasko. Our full article onhow to clean a vacuum cleanerhas information for cleaning all types of vacuums, but here are six ways to keep your stick vacuum clean and maintained: Wash or replace the filter.Check the manufacturer’s guide for specific instructions on cleaning the filter. TheDyson V12 Detect Slim, theRyobi 18V One+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar, and theKenmore Elite CSV Max Cordless Stick Vacuum DS4095 (PDF)all have washable filters. “Remember that the motor is trying to draw air to breathe through the filter,” said Gasko. “Clean the filters often, like at least every other use.” Empty and clean the bin.An overstuffed bin inhibits airflow and suction. Hold the bin over a trash can and tap it until it’s empty. If the bin gets grimy, pop out the bin and clean the whole bowl (consult the manual first). Let it dry fully. Check for clogs.Anything oversized or slightly sticky runs the risk of gumming up the works. Peer into the mechanism and pull out anything that’s stuck. If any part of the vacuum cleaner is clogged up, the machine loses suction power. Clean the attachments.It’s important to clean out any fur, hair, or strings. (And in my house, hay.) Tangled-up brushes don’t just affect cleaning performance but also reduce battery life. “A brush clogged with hair means the motor is going to draw a lot more juice out of the battery and really reduce the amount of time that you can get out of the vacuum,” Gasko explained. Don’t run your vacuum on high for more than a minute or two.Keep it on low or an “eco” setting as much as possible and save the high-power or “boost” mode for spot cleaning. Running your vacuum for long periods on the high setting can damage the battery, said James Brown, service specialist and museum curator atMr. Vacuum Cleaner. Maintain the battery and charger.Unplug your vacuum once it’s fully charged—or better yet, charge it only when you need it. Keeping the battery in the charging dock can shorten its lifespan, said Matthew Childe, director of energy storage at Dyson. Make sure that the charging contacts are clean and that the power adapter is in working order. This guide was edited by Ingrid Skjong and Courtney Schley.

        "content": "As voted on by 503 novelists, nonfiction writers, poets, critics and other book lovers — with a little help from the staff ofThe New York Times Book Review. Many of us find joy in looking back and taking stock of our reading lives, which is why we here at The New York Times Book Review decided to mark the first 25 years of this century with an ambitious project: to take a first swing at determining the most important, influential books of the era. In collaboration with the Upshot,we sent a survey to hundreds of literary luminaries, asking them to name the 10 best books published since Jan. 1, 2000. Stephen King took part. So did Bonnie Garmus, Claudia Rankine, James Patterson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Elin Hilderbrand, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Roxane Gay, Marlon James, Sarah MacLean, Min Jin Lee, Jonathan Lethem and Jenna Bush Hager,to name just a few. And you can also take part!Vote here and let us knowwhat your top 10 books of the century are. We hope you’ll discover a book you’ve always meant to read, or encounter a beloved favorite you’d like to pick up again. Above all, we hope you’re as inspired and dazzled as we are by the breadth of subjects, voices, opinions, experiences and imagination represented here. I’ve read00 I want to read00 Denis Johnson2007 Like the project of the title — an intelligence report that the newly minted C.I.A. operative William “Skip” Sands comes to find both quixotic and useless — the Vietnam-era warfare of Johnson’s rueful, soulful novel lives in shadows, diversions and half-truths. There are no heroes here among the lawless colonels, assassinated priests and faith-stricken NGO nurses; only villainy and vast indifference. Liked it?

Ali Smith2014 This elegant double helix of a novel entwines the stories of a fictional modern-day British girl and a real-life 15th-century Italian painter. A more conventional book might have explored the ways the past and present mirror each other, but Smith is after something much more radical. “How to Be Both” is a passionate, dialectical critique of the binaries that define and confine us. Not only male and female, but also real and imaginary, poetry and prose, living and dead. The way to be “both” is to recognize the extent to which everything already is.— A.O.Scott, critic at large for The Times Liked it?

Ann Patchett2001 A famed opera singer performs for a Japanese executive’s birthday at a luxe private home in South America; it’sthatkind of party. But when a group of young guerrillas swoops in and takes everyone in the house hostage, Patchett’s exquisitely calibrated novel — inspired by a real incident — becomes a piano wire of tension, vibrating on high. My wife and I share books we love with our kids, and after I raved about “Bel Canto” — the voice, the setting, the way romance and suspense are so perfectly braided — I gave copies to my kids, and they all loved it, too. My son was in high school then, and he became a kind of lit-pusher, pressing his beloved copy into friends’ hands. We used to call him the Keeper of the Bel Canto.— JessWalter, author of “Beautiful Ruins” Liked it? Try “Nocturnes,” by Kazuo Ishiguro or “The Piano Tuner,” by Daniel Mason.

Jesmyn Ward2013 Sandwiched between her two National Book Award-winning novels, Ward’s memoir carries more than fiction’s force in its aching elegy for five young Black men (a brother, a cousin, three friends) whose untimely exits from her life came violently and without warning. Their deaths — from suicide and homicide, addiction and accident — place the hidden contours of race, justice and cruel circumstance in stark relief. Liked it?

Saidiya Hartman2019 A beautiful, meticulously researched exploration of the lives of Black girls whom early-20th-century laws designated as “wayward” for such crimes as having serial lovers, or an excess of desire, or a style of comportment that was outside white norms. Hartman grapples with “the power and authority of the archive and the limits it sets on what can be known” about poor Black women, but from the few traces she uncovers in the historical record, she manages to sketch moving portraits, restoring joy and freedom and movement to what, in other hands, might have been mere statistics.— LailaLalami, author of “The Other Americans” Liked it?

Hilary Mantel2012 The title comes from an old English legal phrase for summoning men who have been accused of treason to trial; in the court’s eyes, effectively, they are already dead. But Mantel’s tour-de-force portrait of Thomas Cromwell, the second installment in her vaunted “Wolf Hall” series, thrums with thrilling, obstinate life: a lowborn statesman on the rise; a king in love (and out of love, and in love again); a mad roundelay of power plays, poisoned loyalties and fateful realignments. It’s only empires, after all. Liked it? Try “This Is Happiness,” by Niall Williams or “The Western Wind,” by Samantha Harvey. Interested?Read our review.

Zadie Smith2005 Consider it a bold reinvention of “Howards End,” or take Smith’s sprawling third novel as its own golden thing: a tale of two professors — one proudly liberal, the other staunchly right-wing — whose respective families’ rivalries and friendships unspool over nearly 450 provocative, subplot-mad pages. “You don’t have favorites among your children, but you do have allies.” Let’s admit it: Family is often a kind of war, even if telepathically conducted.— AlexandraJacobs, book critic for The Times Liked it?

Emily St. John Mandel2014 Increasingly, and for obvious reasons, end-times novels are not hard to find. But few have conjured the strange luck of surviving an apocalypse — civilization preserved via the ad hoc Shakespeare of a traveling theater troupe; entire human ecosystems contained in an abandoned airport —  with as much spooky melancholic beauty as Mandel does in her beguiling fourth novel.

Elena Ferrante; translated by Ann Goldstein2005 There is something scandalous about this picture of a sensible, adult woman almost deranged by the breakup of her marriage, to the point of neglecting her children. The psychodrama is naked — sometimes hard to read, at other moments approaching farce. Just as Ferrante drew an indelible portrait of female friendship in her quartet of Neapolitan novels, here, she brings her all-seeing eye to female solitude. “The circle of an empty day is brutal, and at night it tightens around your neck like a noose.” It so simply encapsulates how solitude can, with the inexorable passage of time, calcify into loneliness and then despair.— AlexandraJacobs Liked it?

Philip Roth2000 Set during the Clinton impeachment imbroglio, this is partly a furious indictment of what would later be called cancel culture, partly an inquiry into the paradoxes of class, sex and race in America. A college professor named Coleman Silk is persecuted for making supposedly racist remarks in class. Nathan Zuckerman, his neighbor (and Roth’s trusty alter ego), learns that Silk, a fellow son of Newark, is a Black man who has spent most of his adult life passing for white. Of all the Zuckerman novels, this one may be the most incendiary, and the most unsettling.— A.O.Scott Liked it? Try “Vladimir,” by Julia May Jonas or “Blue Angel,” by Francine Prose.

Viet Thanh Nguyen2015 Penned as a book-length confession from a nameless North Vietnamese spy as Saigon falls and new duties in America beckon, Nguyen’s richly faceted novel seems to swallow multiple genres whole, like a satisfied python: political thriller and personal history, cracked metafiction and tar-black comedy.

Hisham Matar2016 Though its Pulitzer Prize was bestowed in the category of biography, Matar’s account of searching for the father he lost to a 1990 kidnapping in Cairo functions equally as absorbing detective story, personal elegy and acute portrait of doomed geopolitics — all merged, somehow, with the discipline and cinematic verve of a novel.

If her work has become a byword for short (nay, microdose) fiction, this collection proves why it is also hard to shake; a conflagration of odd little umami bombs — sometimes several pages, sometimes no more than a sentence — whose casual, almost careless wordsmithery defies their deadpan resonance.

But when the novel’s messy triangular romance — between two trans characters and a cis-gendered woman — becomes an unlikely story about parenthood, the plot deepens, and so does its emotional resonance: a poignant and gratifyingly cleareyed portrait of found family. Peters’s sly wit and observational genius, her ability to balance so many intimate realities, cultural forces and zeitgeisty happenings made my head spin. It got me hot, cracked me up, punched my heart with grief and understanding. I’m in awe of her abilities, and will re-read this book periodically just to remember how it’s done.— MichelleTea, author of “Against Memoir” Liked it?

Blight2018 It is not hard to throw a rock and hit a Great Man biography; Blight’s earns its stripes by smartly and judiciously excavating the flesh-and-bone man beneath the myth. Though Douglass famously wrote three autobiographies of his own, there turned out to be much between the lines that is illuminated here with rigor, flair and refreshing candor. Liked it?

George Saunders2000 An ersatz caveman languishes at a theme park; a dead maiden aunt comes back to screaming, scatological life; a bachelor barber born with no toes dreams of true love, or at least of getting his toe-nubs licked. The stories in Saunders’s second collection are profane, unsettling and patently absurd. They’re also freighted with bittersweet humanity, and rendered in language so strange and wonderful, it sings.

Siddhartha Mukherjee2010 The subtitle, “A Biography of Cancer,” provides some helpful context for what lies between the covers of Mukherjee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, though it hardly conveys the extraordinary ambition and empathy of his telling, as the trained oncologist weaves together disparate strands of large-scale history, biology and devastating personal anecdote.

Benjamín Labatut; translated by Adrian Nathan West2021 You don’t have to know anything about quantum theory to start reading this book, a deeply researched, exquisitely imagined group portrait of tormented geniuses. By the end, you’ll know enough to be terrified. Labatut is interested in how the pursuit of scientific certainty can lead to, or arise from, states of extreme psychological and spiritual upheaval. His characters — Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger, among others — discover a universe that defies rational comprehension. After them, “scientific method and its object could no longer be prised apart.” That may sound abstract, but in Labatut’s hands the story of quantum physics is violent, suspenseful and finally heartbreaking.— A.O.Scott Liked it?

Fernanda Melchor; translated by Sophie Hughes2020 Her sentences are sloping hills; her paragraphs, whole mountains. It’s no wonder that Melchor was dubbed a sort of south-of-the-border Faulkner for her baroque and often brutally harrowing tale of poverty, paranoia and murder (also: witches, or at least the idea of them) in a fictional Mexican village. When a young girl impregnated by her pedophile stepfather unwittingly lands there, her arrival is the spark that lights a tinderbox. Liked it?

John Jeremiah Sullivan2011 When this book of essays came out, it bookended a fading genre: collected pieces written on deadline by “pulpheads,” or magazine writers. Whether it’s Sullivan’s visit to a Christian rock festival, his profile of Axl Rose or a tribute to an early American botanist, he brings to his subjects not just depth, but an open-hearted curiosity. Indeed, if this book feels as if it’s from a different time, perhaps that’s because of its generous receptivity to other ways of being, which offers both reader and subject a kind of grace. Liked it?

Elena Ferrante; translated by Ann Goldstein2015 All things, even modern literature’s most fraught female friendship, must come to an end. As the now middle-aged Elena and Lila continue the dance of envy and devotion forged in their scrappy Neapolitan youth, the conclusion of Ferrante’s four-book saga defies the laws of diminishing returns, illuminating the twined psychologies of its central pair — intractable, indelible, inseparable — in one last blast of X-ray prose.

Lucia Berlin2015 Berlin began writing in the 1960s, and collections of her careworn, haunted, messily alluring yet casually droll short stories were published in the 1980s and ’90s. But it wasn’t until 2015, when the best were collected into a volume called “A Manual for Cleaning Women,” that her prodigious talent was recognized. Berlin writes about harried and divorced single women, many of them in working-class jobs, with uncanny grace. She is the real deal.— DwightGarner, book critic for The Times “I hate to see anything lovely by myself.” It’s so true, to me at least, and I have heard no other writer express it.— DwightGarner Liked it?

Jon Fosse; translated by Damion Searls2022 You may not be champing at the bit to read a seven-part, nearly 700-page novel written in a single stream-of-consciousness sentence with few paragraph breaks and two central characters with the same name. But this Norwegian masterpiece, by the winner of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature, is the kind of soul-cleansing work that seems to silence the cacophony of the modern world — a pair of noise-canceling headphones in book form. The narrator, a painter named Asle, drives out to visit his doppelgänger, Asle, an ailing alcoholic. Then the narrator takes a boat ride to have Christmas dinner with some friends. That, more or less, is the plot. But throughout, Fosse’s searching reflections on God, art and death are at once haunting and deeply comforting. I had not read Fosse before he won the Nobel Prize, and I wanted to catch up. Luckily for me, the critic Merve Emre (who has championed his work) is my colleague at Wesleyan, so I asked her where to start. I was hoping for a shortcut, but she sternly told me that there was nothing to do but to read the seven-volume “Septology” translated by Damion Searls. Luckily for me, I had 30 hours of plane travel in the next week or so, and I had a Kindle. Reading “Septology” in the cocoon of a plane was one of the great aesthetic experiences of my life. The hypnotic effects of the book were amplified by my confinement, and the paucity of distractions helped me settle into its exquisite rhythms. The repetitive patterns of Fosse’s prose made its emotional waves, when they came, so much more powerful.— MichaelRoth, president of Wesleyan University Liked it?

Tayari Jones2018 Life changes in an instant for Celestial and Roy, the young Black newlyweds at the beating, uncomfortably realistic heart of Jones’s fourth novel. On a mostly ordinary night, during a hotel stay near his Louisiana hometown, Roy is accused of rape. He is then swiftly and wrongfully convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The couple’s complicated future unfolds, often in letters, across two worlds. The stain of racism covers both places. Liked it?

Neither of those bare facts telegraphs the emotional and narrative breadth of Zevin’s breakout novel, her fifth for adults. As the childhood friendship between two future game-makers blooms into a rich creative collaboration and, later, alienation, the book becomes a dazzling disquisition on art, ambition and the endurance of platonic love.

Elizabeth Strout2008 When this novel-in-stories won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2009, it was a victory for crotchety, unapologetic women everywhere, especially ones who weren’t, as Olive herself might have put it, spring chickens. The patron saint of plain-spokenness — and the titular character of Strout’s 13 tales — is a long-married Mainer with regrets, hopes and a lobster boat’s worth of quiet empathy. Her small-town travails instantly became stand-ins for something much bigger, even universal. Liked it?

Robert Caro2012 The fourth volume of Caro’s epic chronicle of Lyndon Johnson’s life and times is a political biography elevated to the level of great literature. His L.B.J. is a figure of  Shakespearean magnitude, whose sudden ascension from the abject humiliations of the vice presidency to the summit of political power is a turn of fortune worthy of a Greek myth. Caro makes you feel the shock of J.F.K.’s assassination, and brings you inside Johnson’s head on the blood-drenched day when his lifelong dream finally comes true.

The death of the dream of Communism reverberates through the Nobel-winning Alexievich’s oral history, and her unflinching portrait of the people who survived the Soviet state (or didn’t) —  ex-prisoners, Communist Party officials, ordinary citizens of all stripes — makes for an excoriating, eye-opening read.

The books detail Ditlevsen’s hardscrabble childhood, her flourishing early career as a poet and her catastrophic addictions, which left her wedded to a psychotic doctor and hopelessly dependent on opioids by her 30s. But her writing, however dire her circumstances, projects a breathtaking clarity and candidness, and it nails what is so inexplicable about human nature. Liked it?

Jones2006 Jones’s follow-up to his Pulitzer-anointed historical novel, “The Known World,” forsakes a single narrative for 14 interconnected stories, disparate in both direction and tone. His tales of 20th-century Black life in and around Washington, D.C., are haunted by cumulative loss and touched, at times, by dark magical realism — one character meets the Devil himself in a Safeway parking lot — but girded too by loveliness, and something like hope. “It was, I later learned about myself, as if my heart, on the path that was my life, had come to a puddle in the road and had faltered, hesitated, trying to decide whether to walk over the puddle or around it, or even to go back.” The metaphor is right at the edge of corniness, but it's rendered with such specificity that it catches you off guard, and the temporal complexity — the way the perspective moves forward, backward and sideways in time — captures an essential truth about memory and regret.— A.O.Scott Liked it?

Ben Lerner2014 How closely does Ben Lerner, the very clever author of  “10:04,” overlap with its unnamed narrator, himself a poet-novelist who bears a remarkable resemblance to the man pictured on its biography page? Definitive answers are scant in this metaphysical turducken of a novel, which is nominally about the attempts of a Brooklyn author, burdened with a hefty publishing advance, to finish his second book. But the delights of Lerner’s shimmering self-reflexive prose, lightly dusted with photographs and illustrations, are endless. “Shaving is a way to start the workday by ritually not cutting your throat when you’ve the chance.” “10:04” is filled with sentences that cut this close to the bone. Comedy blends with intimations of the darkest aspects of our natures, and of everyday life. Who can shave anymore without recalling this “Sweeney Todd”-like observation?— DwightGarner Liked it?

George Saunders2013 For all of their linguistic invention and anarchic glee, Saunders’s stories are held together by a strict understanding of the form and its requirements. Take plot: In “Tenth of December,” his fourth and best collection, readers will encounter an abduction, a rape, a chemically induced suicide, the suppressed rage of a milquetoast or two, a veteran’s post-­traumatic impulse to burn down his mother’s house — all of it buffeted by gusts of such merriment and tender regard and daffy good cheer that you realize only in retrospect how dark these morality tales really are. Nobody writes like George Saunders. He has cultivated a genuinely original voice, one that is hilarious and profound, tender and monstrous, otherworldly and deeply familiar, much like the American psyche itself.

Are there choices that would lead, finally, to justice or happiness or save us from pain? Atkinson wrestles with these questions in her brilliant “Life After Life” —  a historical novel, a speculative novel, a tale of time travel, a moving portrait of life before, during and in the aftermath of war.

It starts out as a tale of wealth and power in 1920s New York — something Theodore Dreiser or Edith Wharton might have taken up — and leaps forward in time, across the boroughs and down the social ladder, breathing new vitality into the weary tropes of historical fiction.— A.O.Scott Be prepared for some serious mind games! Set in New York City in the 1920s and ’30s, the story of a Manhattan financier and his high-society wife is told through four “books” — a novel, a manuscript, a memoir and a journal. But which version should you trust? Is there even one true reality? As we sift our way through these competing narratives, Diaz serves us clues and red herrings in equal measure. We know we are being gamed, but we’re not sure exactly which character is gaming us. While each reader will draw their own conclusion when they reach the end of this complex and thrilling book, what is never disputed is the ease with which money and power can bend reality itself.— DuaLipa, singer and songwriter behind the Service95 Book Club Liked it?

That 13-year-old Theo Decker survives the museum bombing that kills his mother is a minor miracle; the tiny, priceless souvenir he inadvertently grabs from the rubble becomes both a talisman and an albatross in this heady, haunted symphony of a novel.

An account of her pregnancy, her relationship with the artist Harry Dodge and the early stages of motherhood, “The Argonauts” explores queer identity, gender politics and the meaning of family. What makes Nelson such a valuable writer is her willingness to follow the sometimes contradictory rhythms of her own thinking in prose that is sharp, supple and disarmingly heartfelt.— A.O.Scott Liked it?

From its heartbreaking opening (a mother’s murdered child) to its shattering conclusion, Jemisin shows the power of what good fantasy fiction can do. “The Fifth Season” explores loss, grief and personhood on an intimate level. But it also takes on themes of discrimination, human breeding and ecological collapse with an unflinching eye and a particular nuance.

Moralistically, though, it might as well be the Middle Ages as he reckons with the ongoing sins of the Catholic Church and the everyday tragedies wrought by repression, fear and rank hypocrisy.

Jennifer Egan2010 In the good old pre-digital days, artists used to cram 15 or 20 two-and-a-half-minute songs onto a single vinyl LP. Egan accomplished a similar feat of compression in this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, a compact, chronologically splintered rock opera with (as they say nowadays) no skips. The 13 linked stories jump from past to present to future while reshuffling a handful of vivid characters. The themes are mighty but the mood is funny, wistful and intimate, as startling and familiar as your favorite pop album.— A.O.Scott Liked it?

Roberto Bolaño; translated by Natasha Wimmer2007 “The Savage Detectives” is brash, hilarious, beautiful, moving. It’s also over 600 pages long, which is why I know that my memory of reading it in a single sitting is definitely not true. Still, the fact that it feels that way is telling. I was not the same writer I’d been before reading it, not the same person. Arturo Belano and Ulises Lima, the wayward poets whose youth is chronicled in “Detectives,”  became personal heroes, and everything I’ve written since has been shaped by Bolaño’s masterpiece.— DanielAlarcón, author of “At Night We Walk in Circles” Liked it?

Strayer2018 Spanning decades, this is an outlier in Ernaux’s oeuvre; unlike her other books, with their tight close-ups on moments in her life, here such intimacies are embedded in the larger sweep of social history. She moves between the chorus of conventional wisdom and the specifics of her own experiences, showing how even an artist with such a singular vision could recognize herself as a creature of her cohort and her culture. Most moving to me is how she begins and ends by listing images she can still recall — a merry-go-round in the park; graffiti in a restroom — that have been inscribed into her memory, yet are ultimately ephemeral.— JenniferSzalai Liked it?

Ta-Nehisi Coates2015 Framed, like James Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time,” as both instruction and warning to a young relative on “how one should live within a Black body,” Coates’s book-length letter to his 15-year-old son lands like forked lightning. In pages suffused with both fury and tenderness, his memoir-manifesto delineates a world in which the political remains mortally, maddeningly inseparable from the personal. Liked it?

Alison Bechdel2006 “A queer business.” That’s how Bechdel describes her closeted father’s death after he steps in the path of a Sunbeam Bread truck. The phrase also applies to her family’s funeral home concern; their own Victorian, Addams-like dwelling; and this marvelous graphic memoir of growing up gay and O.C.D.-afflicted (which generated a remarkable Broadway musical). You forget, returning to “Fun Home,” that the only color used is a dreamy gray-blue; that’s how vivid and particular the story is. Even the corpses crackle with life.— AlexandraJacobs I read “Fun Home” with creative writing students in a course I teach at Dartmouth College called “Investigative Memoir.” The first time I taught it, a student wrote in their anonymous course evaluation, “I should not have been exposed to this” — the censorious voice tends to be passive. The last time I taught it, a student said that if they’d found this in their high school library — in a state in which such books are now all but illegal in high school libraries — it would have changed their life. I’m long past my schooling, but “Fun Home” still changes my life every time I return.— JeffSharlet, author of “The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War” Liked it?

This collection — which appeared two years after Trayvon Martin’s death, and pointedly displays a hoodie on its cover like the one Martin wore when he was killed — lays out a damning indictment of American racism through a mix of free verse, essayistic prose poems and visual art; a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist in both poetry and criticism (the first book ever nominated in two categories), it took home the prize in poetry in a deserving recognition of Rankine’s subtle, supple literary gifts.

Jesmyn Ward2017 Road trips aren’t supposed to be like this: an addled addict mother dragging her 13-year-old son and his toddler sister across Mississippi to retrieve their father from prison, and feeding her worst habits along the way. Grief and generational trauma haunt the novel, as do actual ghosts, the unrestful spirits of men badly done by. But Ward’s unflinching prose is not a punishment; it loops and soars in bruising, beautiful arias. “Home is about the earth. Whether the earth open up to you. Whether it pull you so close the space between you and it melt and it beats like your heart. Same Time.” “This passage from ‘Sing, Unburied, Sing’ means so much to me.

Two questions arise: 1) Who is the real genius? 2) Who is Ludo’s father? Ludo’s search for the answer to No. 2 propels the plot of this funny, cruel, compassionate, typographically bananas novel.

David Mitchell2004 Mitchell’s almost comically ambitious novel is indeed a kind of cumulus: a wild and woolly condensation of ideas, styles and far-flung milieus whose only true commonality is the reincarnated soul at its center. The book’s six nesting narratives — from 1850s New Zealand through 1930s Belgium, groovy California, recent-ish England, dystopian Korea and Hawaii — also often feel like a postmodern puzzle-box that whirls and clicks as its great world(s) spin, throwing off sparks of pulp, philosophy and fervid humanism.

(In the sequel, she’d have a Substack.) Ifemelu’s entanglements with various men undergird a rich and rough tapestry of life in Barack Obama’s America and beyond. And Adichie’s sustained examination of absurd social rituals — like the painful relaxation of professionally “unacceptable” hair, for example — is revolutionary.— AlexandraJacobs Liked it?

Adrian Nicole LeBlanc2003 More than 20 years after it was published, “Random Family” still remains unmatched in depth and power and grace.

In place of triumph-of-the-human-spirit bromides, though, what the book delivers is its own kind of cinema, harsh and true. Liked it?

Patrick Radden Keefe2019 “Say Nothing”  is an amazing accomplishment — a definitive, impeccably researched history of the Troubles, a grim, gripping thriller, an illuminating portrait of  extraordinary people who did unspeakable things, driven by what they saw as the justness of their cause.  Those of us who lived in the U.K. in the last three decades of the 20th century know the names and the events — we were all affected, in some way or another, by the bombs, the bomb threats, the assassinations and attempted assassinations.

The only novel to date by a writer revered for his satirical short stories, this book marks less a change of course than a foregrounding of what has distinguished his work all along — a generosity of spirit, an ear acutely tuned to human suffering.

Paul Beatty2015 Part of this wild satire on matters racial, post-racial, maybe-racial and Definitely Not Racial in American life concerns a group known as the Dum Dum Donut Intellectuals. One of them has produced an expurgated edition of an American classic titled “The Pejorative-Free Adventures and Intellectual and Spiritual Journeys of African-American Jim and His Young Protégé, White Brother Huckleberry Finn, as They Go in Search of the Lost Black Family Unit.” Beatty’s method is the exact opposite: In his hands, everything sacred is profaned, from the Supreme Court to the Little Rascals. “The Sellout” is explosively funny and not a little bit dangerous: an incendiary device disguised as a whoopee cushion, or maybe vice versa.— A.O.Scott Some voices are so sharp they slice right through reality to reveal everything we’ve been hiding or ignoring or didn’t know was there.

Michael Chabon2000 Set during the first heyday of the American comic book industry, from the late 1930s to the early 1950s, Chabon’s exuberant epic centers on the Brooklyn-raised Sammy Clay and his Czech immigrant cousin, Joe Kavalier, who together pour their hopes and fears into a successful comic series even as life delivers them some nearly unbearable tragedies. Besotted with language and brimming with pop culture, political relevance and bravura storytelling, the novel won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2001. “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay” combines eloquent prose, captivating characters, a deeply researched setting and an adventure that previously only belonged to the pulps. High art and low art and who the heck cares? Chabon opened the doors not just for comic book nerds, but for every kind of nerd, including this gay one.

Yet McCarthy renders his deathscape in curious, riveting detail punctuated by flashes of a lost world from the man’s memory that become colorful myths for his son. In the end, “The Road” is a paean to parental love:  A father nurtures and protects his child with ingenuity and tenderness, a triumph that feels redemptive even in a world without hope.— JenniferEgan, author of “A Visit From the Goon Squad” Liked it?

Marilynne Robinson2004 The first installment in what is so far a tetralogy — followed by “Home,” “Lila” and “Jack” — “Gilead” takes its title from the fictional town in Iowa where the Boughton and Ames families reside. And also from the Book of Jeremiah, which names a place where healing may or may not be found: “Is there no balm in Gilead?” For John Ames, who narrates this novel, the answer seems to be yes. An elderly Congregationalist minister who has recently become a husband and father, he finds fulfillment in both vocation and family. Robinson allows him, and us, the full measure of his hard-earned joy, but she also has an acute sense of the reality of sin. If this book is a celebration of the quiet decency of small-town life (and mainline Protestantism) in the 1950s, it is equally an unsparing critique of how the moral fervor and religious vision of the abolitionist movement curdled, a century later, into complacency.— A.O.Scott “Then he put his hat back on and stalked off into the trees again and left us standing there in that glistening river, amazed at ourselves and shining like the apostles. I mention this because it seems to me transformations just that abrupt do occur in this life, and they occur unsought and unawaited, and they beggar your hopes and your deserving.” From a dog-eared, battered, underlined copy of Marilynne Robinson’s “Gilead,” I offer the following quote which undoes me every time I read it — transformation and its possibility is so much a part of what I read for.— KateDiCamillo, novelist Liked it?

Kazuo Ishiguro2005 Kathy, Ruth and Tommy are boarders at an elite English school called Hailsham. Supervised by a group of “guardians,” the friends share music and rumors while navigating the shifting loyalties and heartbreaks of growing up. It’s all achingly familiar — at times, even funny. But things begin to feel first off, then sinister and, ultimately, tragic.  As in so much of the best dystopian fiction, the power of “Never Let Me Go” to move and disturb arises from the persistence of human warmth in a chilly universe  — and in its ability to make us see ourselves through its uncanny mirror. Is Ishiguro commenting on biotechnology, reproductive science, the cognitive dissonance necessary for life under late-stage capitalism? He’d never be so didactic as to tell you.

Colson Whitehead2016 “The Underground Railroad” is a profound revelation of the intricate aspects of slavery and nebulous shapes of freedom featuring an indomitable female protagonist: Cora from Georgia. The novel seamlessly combines history, horror and fantasy with philosophical speculation and cultural criticism to tell a compulsively readable, terror-laden narrative of a girl with a fierce inner spark who follows the mysterious path of her mother, Mabel, the only person ever known to have escaped from the Randall plantations. I could hardly make it through this plaintively brutal novel. Neither could I put it down. “The Underground Railroad” bleeds truth in a way that few treatments of slavery can, fiction or nonfiction. Whitehead’s portrayals of human motivation, interaction and emotional range astonish in their complexity. Here brutality is bone deep and vulnerability is ocean wide, yet bravery and hope shine through in Cora’s insistence on escape. I rooted for Cora in a way that I never had for a character, my heart breaking with each violation of her spirit. Just as Cora inherits her mother’s symbolic victory garden, we readers of Whitehead’s imaginary world can inherit Cora’s courage.— TiyaMiles, author of “All That She Carried: The Journey of Ashley’s Sack, a Black Family Keepsake” “Mabel had packed for her adventure. A machete. Flint and tinder. She stole a cabin mate’s shoes, which were in better shape. For weeks, her empty garden testified to her miracle. Before she lit out she dug up every yam from their plot, a cumbersome load and ill-advised for a journey that required a fleet foot. The lumps and burrows in the dirt were a reminder to all who walked by. Then one morning they were all smoothed over. Cora got on her knees and planted anew.

Roberto Bolaño; translated by Natasha Wimmer2008 Bolaño’s feverish, vertiginous novel opens with an epigraph from Baudelaire — “An oasis of horror in a desert of boredom” — and then proceeds, over the course of some 900 pages, to call into being an entire world governed in equal parts by boredom and the deepest horror. The book (published posthumously) is divided into five loosely conjoined sections, following characters who are drawn for varying reasons to the fictional Mexican city of Santa Teresa: a group of academics obsessed with an obscure novelist, a doddering philosophy professor, a lovelorn police officer and an American reporter investigating the serial murders of women in a case with echoes of the real-life femicide that has plagued Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. In Natasha Wimmer’s spotless translation, Bolaño’s novel is profound, mysterious, teeming and giddy: Reading it, you go from feeling like a tornado watcher to feeling swept up in the vortex, and finally suspect you might be the tornado yourself.

Jonathan Franzen2001 With its satirical take on mental health, self-improvement and instant gratification, Franzen’s comic novel of family disintegration is as scathingly entertaining today as it was when it was published at the turn of the millennium. The story, about a Midwestern matron named Enid Lambert who is determined to bring her three adult children home for what might be their father’s last Christmas, touches on everything from yuppie excess to foodie culture to Eastern Europe’s unbridled economy after the fall of communism — but it is held together, always, by family ties. The novel jumps deftly from character to character, and the reader’s sympathies jump with it; in a novel as alert to human failings as this one is, it is to Franzen’s enduring credit that his genuine affection for all of the characters shines through. Sometimes we have a totemic connection to a book that deepens our appreciation. I had Jonathan Franzen's brand-new doorstop of a hardcover with me when I was trapped in an office park hotel outside Denver after 9/11. The marvelous, moving, often very funny novel kept me company when I needed company most. As Franzen himself wrote, “Fiction is a solution, the best solution, to the problem of existential solitude.”— ChrisBohjalian, author of “The Flight Attendant” Liked it?

Jones2003 This novel, about a Black farmer, bootmaker and former slave named Henry Townsend, is a humane epic and a staggering feat of wily American storytelling. Set in Virginia during the antebellum era, the milieu — politics, moods, manners — is starkly and intensely realized. When Henry becomes the proprietor of a plantation, with slaves of his own, the moral sands shift under the reader’s feet. Grief piles upon grief. But there is a glowing humanity at work here as well. Moments of humor and unlikely good will bubble up organically. Jones is a confident storyteller, and in “The Known World” that confidence casts a spell. This is a large novel that moves nimbly, and stays with the reader for a long time.— DwightGarner Liked it? Try “The Water Dancer,” by Ta-Nehisi Coates or “A Mercy,” by Toni Morrison.

Hilary Mantel2009 It was hard choosing the books for my list, but the first and easiest choice I made was “Wolf Hall.” (“The Mirror and the Light,” the third book in Mantel’s trilogy, was the second easiest.) We see the past the way we see the stars, dimly, through a dull blurry scrim of atmosphere, but Mantel was like an orbital telescope: She saw history with cold, hard, absolute clarity. In “Wolf Hall” she took a starchy historical personage, Thomas Cromwell, and saw the vivid, relentless, blind-spotted, memory-haunted, grandly alive human being he must have been. Then she used him as a lens to show us the age he lived in, the vast, intricate spider web of power and money and love and need — right up until the moment the spider got him.— LevGrossman, author of “The Bright Sword” Liked it?

Isabel Wilkerson2010 Wilkerson’s intimate, stirring, meticulously researched and myth-dispelling book, which details the Great Migration of Black Americans from South to North and West from 1915 to 1970, is the most vital and compulsively readable work of history in recent memory. This migration, she writes, “would become perhaps the biggest underreported story of the 20th century. It was vast. It was leaderless. It crept along so many thousands of currents over so long a stretch of time as to be difficult for the press truly to capture while it was under way.” Wilkerson blends the stories of individual men and women with a masterful grasp of the big picture, and a great deal of literary finesse. “The Warmth of Other Suns” reads like a novel. It bears down on the reader like a locomotive.— DwightGarner Liked it? Try “The Twelve Tribes of Hattie,” by Ayana Mathis, “All Aunt Hagar’s Children,” by Edward P.

Elena Ferrante; translated by Ann Goldstein2012 The first volume of what would become Ferrante’s riveting four-book series of Neapolitan novels introduced readers to two girls growing up in a poor, violent neighborhood in Naples, Italy: the diligent, dutiful Elena and her charismatic, wilder friend Lila, who despite her fierce intelligence is seemingly constrained by her family’s meager means. From there the book (like the series as a whole) expands as propulsively as the early universe, encompassing ideas about art and politics, class and gender, philosophy and fate, all through a dedicated focus on the conflicted, competitive friendship between Elena and Lila as they grow into complicated adults. It’s impossible to say how closely the series tracks the author’s life — Ferrante writes under a pseudonym — but no matter: “My Brilliant Friend” is entrenched as one of the premier examples of so-called autofiction, a category that has dominated the literature of the 21st century. Reading this uncompromising, unforgettable novel is like riding a bike on gravel: It’s gritty and slippery and nerve-racking, all at the same time. Liked it?

Keep track of the books you want to read by checking the box under their entries. Methodology In collaboration with the Upshot — the department at The Times focused on data and analytical journalism — the Book Review sent a survey to hundreds of novelists, nonfiction writers, academics, book editors, journalists, critics, publishers, poets, translators, booksellers, librarians and other literary luminaries, asking them to pick their 10 best books of the 21st century. We let them each define “best” in their own way. For some, this simply meant “favorite.” For others, it meant books that would endure for generations. The only rules: Any book chosen had to be published in the United States, in English, on or after Jan. 1, 2000. (Yes, translations counted!) After casting their ballots, respondents were given the option to answer a series of prompts where they chose their preferred book between two randomly selected titles. We combined data from these prompts with the vote tallies to create the list of the top 100 books. Designed by Aliza Aufrichtig. Produced by Aliza Aufrichtig, Josh Katz and Kevin Quealy.

        "content": "Stewart Rhodes, ex-head of far-right group, had been banned from district and Capitol Hill without court consent A federal judge has rescinded an order barringStewart Rhodes, the former leader of thefar-rightOath Keepers group, and several other defendants charged in connection to the6 January2021attack on Congress, from entering Washington DC and the US Capitol without permission from a court. On Monday, the US district judge Amit Mehta stated inan orderthat while the court is declining to dismiss the supervised release terms entirely – as the justice department had requested – the defendants are “no longer bound by the judicially imposed conditions of supervised release. “It is not for this court to divine why President Trump commuted Defendants’ sentences, or to assess whether it was sensible to do so,” Mehtawrote. “The court’s sole task is to determine the act’s effect.” Mehta noted that the unconditional nature of Donald Trump’s proclamation “can reasonably be read to extinguish enforcement of Defendants’ terms of supervised release”. He added, “it would be improper for the court post-commutation to modify the original sentences” and that “by virtue of the President’s commutation order, the court acknowledges that its conditions of supervision will not be enforced”. The order on Monday comes just three days after the same judge issued theinitial orderrestricting Rhodes and the others from entering Washington DC without permission from the court. After that order was issued on Friday, the US Department of Justice, through acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin,intervenedon behalf of Rhodes and other members of the militia group and asked Mehta to vacate the ban and dismiss the terms of supervised release. In 2023, Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his role in orchestrating the breach of the Capitol on January 6. But last week, he, and the seven others in this order, were amongst the 1,500 individualsgrantedblanket pardons or commutations by Trump shortly after he wasinauguratedas the 47th president of the United States. Rhodes left prison last Tuesday and was later spotted on Capitol Hill.",

When my husband goes away, I get sad and eat nothing but crisps “When I go to see him, love to see him. When it’s time to leave, bye-bye, see you soon. Life is good.” That’sactor Sheryl Lee Ralph, who plays Barbara in the lovely school sitcom Abbott Elementary, telling People magazine about her 19-year long-distance marriage to “Senator Vincent Hughes, Seventh Senatorial District of Philadelphia”, as she describes him, gloriously enunciating every syllable. It is a sign, I think, of how our attitudes to relationships have evolved that the reaction globally has been positive. WhenHelena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton lived next door to each other, it was seen as evidence of their extreme eccentricity, and Gwyneth Paltrow made waves when she revealed in 2019 that she and her TV producer husband Brad Falchuk weren’t cohabiting full-time (though some saw the advantages. “One of my best friends was like: ‘That is my dream. Don’t ever move in,’”Paltrow said in an interview, after they had moved in together). The vibe in media coverage and online commentary on Ralph’s revelationseems to be overwhelmingly: “Why not? Good for them!” There is an ever-richer spectrum of relationship models around us and Ralph and Hughes’s looks like a perfectly reasonable one (enticing, even: a friend says wistfully that they dream of saying: “My husband and I live separate lives” sometimes). It’s nice to remind ourselves occasionally that not everything in the world has got worse. In principle, I am perfectly suited to long-distance loving. I am deeply rigid and intolerant, crave silence and, likePaltrow, “can’t sleep” if there are dirty dishes in the sink. But my husband and I crossed the Rubicon of having spent more of our lives living together than apart a while back and it’s far too late. We are essentially a single organism at this point, albeit one intermittently at war with itself over the acceptable amount of Capital FM and balsamic vinegar (none). I get sad and strange when he goes away for more than 48 hours, eating only crisps, having pass-agg conversations with the extractor fan and lining up tea towels precisely. I could no more live apart from him than from my liver at this point. I hope I never have to. Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Jason Riddle says he rejected pardon because ‘it happened. I did those things, and they weren’t pardonable’ At least one more person who was convicted in connection with the 2021US Capitol attackcarried out by Donald Trump supporters has rejected a pardon from the president, saying he believed his actions “weren’t pardonable”. In an interview published Friday byNew Hampshire Public Radio(NHPR), US navy veteran Jason Riddle said: “It’s almost like [Trump] was trying to say it didn’t happen. And it happened. I did those things, and they weren’t pardonable. “I don’t want the pardon. And I … reject the pardon.” Riddle entered the US Senate parliamentarian’s office, drank a bottle of wine, stole a book and inflicted damage at the Capitol when Trump supporters attacked the building on 6 January 2021 in a desperate attempt to the then president in office after he lost the presidency to Joe Biden weeks earlier, according to court documents. He received a 90-day prison sentence and was fined $750 in April 2022 for pleading guilty to committing misdemeanors in an attack that was linked to several deaths, including officer suicides. After Trump won back the White House by defeating Kamala Harris in November, he gaveblanket pardons or commutationsto 1,500 people charged or convicted in the attack on Congress carried out in his name. But at minimum a couple of Capitol attackers had turned down Trump’s clemency, which was one of his most prominentcampaign promisesas he ran against Harris. Beside Riddle, 71-year-old Pamela Hemphilltoldthe Guardian on Thursday that she was taking responsibility for the hand she had in what was an attempt to prevent the certification of Biden’s victory over Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Hemphill, who received a 60-day misdemeanor prison sentence and three years of probation after pleading guilty in 2022 to illicitly demonstrating, picketing or parading at the Capitol, said accepting Trump’s pardon would contribute to “propaganda that [the attack] was a peaceful protest”. Riddle, for his part, told NHPR that he believed rejecting Trump’s pardon would boost his employment prospects moving forward. “I’m thinking down the road [if] an employer looks in my background, they see misdemeanors … with a presidential pardon – I think that tends to draw more attention,” Riddle said. Referring to the president’s “Make America great again slogan”, Riddle added: “And I’m sure that’s fine in the Maga world with whoever supports Trump, but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life wondering if [those at] the job I’m applying to … like Trump.” There is not a consensus among legal experts over whether people like Riddle and Hemphill can legally reject Trump’s pardon. Hemphill told theIdaho Statesmanthat she plans to file a letter formally rejecting the pardon. And the outlet cited an 1833 US supreme court ruling later upheld in 1915 that a recipient can turn down a presidential pardon. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion In contrast, a formal federal prosecutor recentlywrotethat commutations and pardons do not depend on defendants’ consent. And the New York Times quoted University of St Thomas law school professor Mark Osler as saying: “It would be a novel act to file a court case to reject a pardon of a misdemeanor, in part because of the low stakes.” Riddle served in the US navy from 2006 to 2010, and he has also worked as a corrections officer, restaurant server and mail carrier. Describing himself as a recovering alcoholic, Riddle told NHPR he was not in recovery at the time he partook in the Capitol attack. Riddle stopped supporting the president after he got out of prison and saw Trump ask his supporters to protest as the then ex-president braced to be charged with falsifying business records in a case that involved hush-money payments to adult film actorStormy Daniels. “I remember thinking, ‘What are you doing, Trump?’” Riddle said to NHPR. “Remember what happened at the [Capitol] riot? Someone might get hurt. Why would you ask people to protest?” New York state prosecutors ultimately convicted Trump of 34 felonies in the case, though his winning a second presidency prevented him from receiving a substantial sentence. Riddle’s rejection of Trump’s pardon came months after he ran as a Republican for one of New Hampshire’s two US House seats. He failed to advance out of the election’s primary in September.",

        "content": "Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist calls fellow tech titan ‘super-smart’ but guilty of ‘overreach’ Bill Gateshas labelled Elon Musk’s embrace of far-right politicians and attempt to interfere in the politics of other countries – including the UK – as “insane shit”. Muskhas in recent weekslaunched a series of unfounded smears at British politiciansfor supposedly covering up a rape scandal over a decade ago. The UK is currently preparing a new online safety law that would restrict some of Musk’s businesses, including the social media site X. Musk – the boss of the electric carmaker Tesla and aerospace firm SpaceX –also gave a Nazi-style salute at a recent rally, and responded to the immediate global condemnation he received by posting a series of puns on the word “Nazi” and related terms. Monday was the80th anniversary of the liberationof the Nazi death camp Auschwitz. Gates also lambasted Musk for embracing not just rightwing politicians but even more extreme ones to the far right, including celebrating the British anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson over the rightwing Reform party leader and Brexit championNigel Farage. Musk has also come out in full-throated support of thefar-right, anti-immigrant, nativist party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). “You want to promote the right wing but say Nigel Farage is not rightwing enough,” Gates told the Sunday Times. “I mean, this is insane shit. You are for the AfD … “If someone is super-smart, and he is, they should think how they can help out. But this is populist stirring.” Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist, said that his fellow multibillionaire tech titan was guilty of “overreach”. “It’s really insane that he can destabilise the political situations in countries,” Gates said. “I think in the US foreigners aren’t allowed to give money; other countries maybe should adopt safeguards to make sure super-rich foreigners aren’t distorting their elections. “It’s difficult to understand why someone who has a car factory in both China and in Germany, whose rocket business is ultra-dependent on relationships with sovereign nations and who is busy cutting $2 trillion in US government expenses and running five companies, is obsessing about this grooming story in the UK. I’m like, what?” Gates donated $50m to the campaign of Kamala Harris before she lost toDonald Trumpin November’s US presidential election and has given away nearly $60bn through the Gates Foundation (including support for the Guardian’s Global Development site). Most of the donated Gates Foundation money was meant to help eradicate diseases such as polio, malaria and HIV – yet he was the subject of a backlash from US Republicans after helping fund vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Robert Kennedy Jr called me a child killer trying to make billions of dollars,” he said, of the vaccine skeptic who Trump has picked for his health secretary. “You have to have a sense of humour. The world is not logical now and you have to accept that you might be treated as the Antichrist for trying to help.” Nevertheless, Gates visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on 27 December for a three-hour dinner. “It was quite an engaging conversation where he listened to me talk about HIV and the need to stay generous and to innovate to get a cure,” Gates said. “I talked a lot about polio and energy and nuclear, and he wasn’t dismissive. “In some ways he is feeling more comfortable and vindicated than at any time in his life, so he is confident,” Gates said, explaining that he did not feel any reluctance to visit the populist rightwing president. “Well, he is the most powerful person in the world and his decision over whether to consider changing HIV funding alone would make the trip worth it, or to encourage Pakistan and Afghanistan to take polio eradication seriously.” Gates added that he met Trump more frequently during his first term as president than he did Joe Biden during his Oval Office tenure. He said: “I had a lot of times when I would go to the White House and they would say, ‘We think you are going to see President Biden today,’ but six times in a row it didn’t happen,” adding that he was instead invited to meet the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, or other staff. Trump, Gates said, “has a lot of ability to help me … Is he going to fund infectious disease innovation or end it? I need to stay close. Whoever gets to enthuse President Trump about the right things, that is God’s work.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Acting attorney general says career officials could not be trusted to ‘faithfully implement the president’s agenda’ Acting attorney general James McHenry on Monday fired more than a dozen federal prosecutors who worked on the two criminal cases againstDonald Trump, saying they could not be trusted to implement the president’s agenda for the justice department, two people familiar with the matter said. The precise extent of the firings were unclear because the department did not disclose names. At the time the cases were dismissed last year, after Trump won the election, special counsel Jack Smith had 17 prosecutors attached to his team. The purge was not unexpected given Trump had vowed, on the campaign trail, to fire Smith, but the abrupt firings were jarring as the acting attorney general took aim at career prosecutors who had served at the department for years through changes in administrations and had gone back to their old jobs. Smith charged Trump in two criminal cases: in Florida, for mishandling classified documents at hisMar-a-Lagoclub and defying a subpoena commanding their return; and in Washington, for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. In the termination notices transmitted to the prosecutors who worked on Smith’s team, McHenry wrote that they were being let go as a result of their “significant role in prosecuting President Trump” which meant they could not be trusted to “assist in faithfully implementing the president’s agenda”. The termination of Smith’s team comes as major personnel changes shook the deputy attorney general’s office, where the top career official Brad Weinsheimer was informed he could either be reassigned to a less powerful post or resign, according to a person familiar with the matter. Weinsheimer, a highly respected veteran of the justice department, was appointed to his current role on an interim basis by Trump’s first attorney general Jeff Sessions, which was made permanent by Trump’s final attorney general Bill Barr. But Trump has since soured on Sessions and Barr, and their endorsements appear to have been of no help to Weinsheimer as the newTrump administrationmoves to clear the senior leadership of the justice department as they prepare to use it to enforce Trump’s personal and political agenda. The White House and a justice department spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment on the personnel moves, which were earlier reported by Fox News. Shortly after Trump announced his presidential bid in November 2022, attorney general Merrick Garland appointed Smith to serve as a special counsel overseeing the investigation of Trump. Smith resigned before Trump took office. In a report released this month, Smith concluded that the president engaged in an “unprecedented criminal effort” to hold on to power after losing the 2020 election, but was thwarted in bringing the case to trial by Trump’s November election victory. Smith also investigated Trump’s retention of classified documents after he left the White House, filing a second federal lawsuit in Florida. Trump’s lawyers have called Smith’s report politically motivated. The president denies any wrongdoing in the cases, both of which Smith dropped shortly after Trump’s election win, citing The two special counsel investigations resulted in indictments, but Smith dropped the cases against Trump after the election, citing a longstanding justice department policy that prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president. In a separate development, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that a Trump-appointed prosecutor had opened an internal review of the justice department’s decision to charge hundreds of January 6 defendants with felony obstruction offenses in connection with the 2021 attack on the US Capitol.",

The attack came after theDeepSeekAI assistant app skyrocketed to the top of Apple’s App Store, becoming the highest rated free app in the US, and climbed high in Google’s Play Store. On itsstatus page, DeepSeek said it started to investigate the issue late Monday night Beijing time. After about two hours of monitoring, the company said it was the victim of a “large-scale malicious attack”. While DeekSeek limited registrations, existing users were still able to log on as usual. The app is now allowing registrations again. DeepSeek’s app is an AI assistant similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot. The news of the app’s ascendency in the US – and ability to edge out American rivals for a fraction of the cost – senttechnology stocks tumblingon Monday. Nvidia, the AI chip maker and most valuable US company, saw its stocks plummet by 13.6% in early trading, wiping out some $500bn in market capitalization. Some tech investors were impressed at how quickly DeepSeek was able to create an AI assistant that nearly equals Google’s and OpenAI’s for roughly $5m while other AI companies spend billions for the same results, particularly withChinaunder strict chip export controls that limit DeepSeek’s access to computational power. The model’s low-budget success could threaten the US’s lead in the AI market. “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment,” the investor Marc Andreessenwroteon X. Carrying the “Sputnik” theme, Vivek Ramaswamyposted: “Sputnik-like moments are a good thing. We don’t need to freak out, we just need to wake up.” Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur and politician who isclose to Donald Trump. Trump himself announced a new $500bn AI venture called Stargate last week. It is a collaboration with OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, and the president guaranteed it would be “the future of technology” in the US. The announcement was derided by Trump ally and AI pioneer Elon Musk, who got into atiff on Xwith OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman over how much money Stargate actually has to invest. Trump, who was attending a House Republicans conference in Florida, said the emergence of a DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call” for US companies. He said American companies “need to be laser-focused on competing to win”. Trump said his decision to revoke the Biden AI rules through executive order will allow AI companies to “focus on being the best” instead of on being the most “woke”.

The order also accused the agency of going beyond its remit by spending more than $1bn “to welcome illegal aliens”, although it did not provide evidence. The review council will consist of “no more than 20 members” and will included the new secretaries of defence and homeland security, Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem. The council is to report to Trump within 180 days. The order was issued after Trump fiercely criticised Fema on Friday during a visit to North Carolina, where more than 100 people were killed inHurricane Helenelast September. Fema rescue operations were the subject of a flood of disinformation from Trump and his supporters on social media, some of itdisseminated by Elon Musk, the owner of X and the president’s most vocal backer. Deanne Criswell, the agency’s then director,calledthe deluge of conspiracy theories “absolutely the worst I have ever seen” and warned that it was hampering relief efforts. During his North Carolina visit, Trump said: “Fema has turned out to be a disaster. I think we recommend that Fema go away. I think, frankly, that Fema is not good.” In fact,Trump does not have the presidential authorityto terminate Fema, which falls under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security and can only be abolished by congressional action. Cam Hamilton, who Trump appointed as the new acting head of Fema last week,wrote to staffassuring them of the agency’s continued role. “Fema is a critical agency which performs an essential mission in support of our national security,” he wrote. “President Trump has laid out his intent to reform Fema, and we stand firmly at the ready to implement real and lasting reform. We have some work to do at Fema and restoring public confidence in this agency is essential.”",

        "content": "Veterans’ help and healthcare among NGOs whose USAid funding has been cut off; Hungary steps aside from blocking Russia sanctions. What we know on day 1,070 Donald’s Trump’s freeze on US foreign aid has left numerous Ukraine-based humanitarian projects without funding,several sources said on Monday. “Most of the projects have received an order to stop,” a source at the US Agency for International Development’s (USAid) mission in Ukraine told AFP. Organisations in Ukraine that support veterans, local media and healthcare are among those to have had their funding curtailed by Washington, with many small local press outlets and aid groups announcing on social networks that they would have to close as a result. Olga Kucher of Veteran Hub told AFP the Ukrainian NGO on Monday had to pause the work of its branch in the central city of Vinnytsia. A number of other Ukrainian and international NGOs said they were affected by the freeze. Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Friday ordered ahalt to virtually all US foreign aid except for Israel and Egypt, and the Trump administration hasput employees on administrative leave accusing them of failing to comply with the order. The EU on Monday extended its wide-ranging sanctions on Russia after Hungary stopped holding up their renewal in return for a declaration on energy security.“This will continue to deprive Moscow of revenues to finance its war. Russia needs to pay for the damage they are causing,” said Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief. The measures includes the continued freezing of Russian central bank assets, the profits from which are being used to finance a $50bn loan to Ukraine backed by the G7. Legally, the EU’s 27 countries must unanimously vote to renew the sanctions every six months. Hungary’s pro-Putin prime minister, Viktor Orbán, had delayed the EU sanctions’ renewal,calling for consultations with the US Trump administration and advocating a “sanctions-free” relationship with Russia. That objection fell apart after Donald Trump took office andthreatened even greater sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s regime. Hungary then cited its complaints about Ukraine ending a transit deal that brought Russian gas to Hungary. At a meeting of EU ambassadors on Monday, the European Commission satisfied Hungary by presenting a statement declaring it was “ready to continue discussions with Ukraine on the supply to Europe through the gas pipeline system in Ukraine”.Asked at a press conference whether the statement actually meant anything, Kallas said: “Well, it meant [something] to Hungary, so that mattered.” An overnight Russian air attack set a private business on fire in Kharkiv,the mayor of the city in north-eastern Ukraine said early on Tuesday.“There is a large-scale fire,” the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said on his Telegram messaging app. “All emergency services are on site. There is no information about potential casualties at this time.” The Ukrainian courts on Monday sentenced a woman from the Kharkiv region to 11 years’ jailfor aiding Russia and backing its invasion on social media. She had passed on information about air defence systems in the region. Another individual, a Russian citizen working at a local bank, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for allegedly spying on the Ukrainian military in the city of Kharkiv, prosecutors said. A Russian court on Monday sentenced a retired teacher to eight years in prison for criticising Vladimir Putin – calling him the head of a “terrorist state” – and outlining allegations of atrocities by soldiers in Ukraine, rights groups said.Konstantin Seleznev, 64, was found guilty of spreading “false information” on social media, a judge at Moscow’s Lefortovo court ruled on Monday, according to the OVD-Info rights group. Seleznez was accused of sharing a copy of a letter he had sent to Russia’s chief prosecutor asking him to investigate allegations that Russian forces had carried out mass killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha at the start of the conflict. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, met and discussed security guarantees and Ukraine joining the EU while in Poland to attend Auschwitz commemoration events.Zelenskyy, who was seen shaking hands with Macron, said that during talks, he and Macron paid “special attention” to “security cooperation and possible formats of security guarantees for Ukraine and the whole of Europe”. The European Council chief, António Costa, also said he met Zelenskyy on Monday for talks and avowed the EU’s “steadfast support”. Costa said he had “encouraged” Zelenskyy to keep working towards EU accession: “Ukraine’s progress so far has been remarkable”. A new school textbook that likens Russia’s war in Ukraine to the Soviet struggle against the Nazisand says Russia was “forced” by Nato to send troops into Ukraine was presented in Moscow on Monday. The “Military History of Russia” is likely to be dismissed by Ukraine’s leadership as propaganda. Nato and Ukraine deny ever posing a threat to Russia.",

        "content": "Memo said some actions in agency ‘appeared to be designed to circumvent’ Trump’s orders and ‘America First’ policy TheTrump administrationhas put on leave about 60 senior career officials at the US Agency for International Development (USAid) workers, sources familiar with the matter said, after Washington put a sweeping freeze on US aid worldwide. The administration on Saturday urged the USAid staff to join the effort to transform how Washington allocates aid around the world in line with Trump’s “America First” policy. It alsothreatened “disciplinary action”for any staff ignoring the administration’s orders. An internal memo sent toUSAidemployees on Monday evening said the new leadership identified several actions in the agency that “appeared to be designed to circumvent the President’s Executive Orders and the mandate from the American people”. “As a result, we have placed a number of USAID employees on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice while we complete our analysis of these actions,” said acting administrator Jason Gray, in the memo reviewed by Reuters. The memo did not spell out how many people were affected by the decision, but five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that it was about 57 to 60 people. Those being put on leave comprised career staff in the leadership positions of almost all USAid bureaus based in Washington, with roles ranging from energy security to water security, children’s education overseas and digital technology, two of the sources said. Staff in the agency’s general counsel’s office were among those targeted. “People are calling it the Monday afternoon massacre,” said Francisco Bencosme, who was USAid’s China policy lead until earlier this month. “This decision undermines our national security and emboldens our adversaries ... Instead of focusing on China, North Korea, or Russia, the Trump administration is going after public servants who have served multiple administrations – including the first Trump administration.” USAid did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since returning to office last week, Trump has taken steps toward fulfilling his vow to remake a federal bureaucracy he believes was hostile to him during his 2017-2021 presidency. He has reassigned or fired hundreds of workers in moves against a swath of agencies. Hours after taking office, Trump ordered a 90-day pause in foreign aid to review if it was aligned with his foreign policy priorities. On Friday, the state department issued a stop-work order worldwide even for existing assistance, calling into question billions of dollars of life-saving aid. A second memo on Saturday made it clear to USAid staff that the pause on foreign aid spending meant “a complete halt”. The only exceptions are for emergency humanitarian food assistance and for officials returning to their duty stations. Further waivers could be issued but will require substantial justification and are subject to a double-layered approval process that includes a final say from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio. USAid-funded programs help millions of people around the world fight against HIV/Aids and provide support for everything from access to clean water, healthcare infrastructure and children’s health. Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, on Monday called for the US to consider additional exemptions. “If this is not reversed, it will wreck US foreign aid … It would permanently weaken USAid,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former USAid official who is now president of Refugees International.",

The White House also told Reuters, that Trump signed an order that eliminated “gender radicalism” from the military. The order does not yet ban transgender soldiers from the military, but directs the Pentagon to create a policy for transgender members of the military, CBS isreporting. Another order Trump signed reinstated soldiers who were expelled for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Trump also signed an executive order to establish a process to build a short-range missile defense system akin to Israel’s Iron Dome. This would take years to build. The orders were signed on US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s first day. Hegseth, whonarrowly securedenough votes to be confirmed, said he planned to make major changes in the Pentagon. He did not rule out making changes to the top brass. That’s all from us today. It was another busy day at the start of the second week of Trump’s second term. Here’s what happened: Donald Trump signed three executive orders on Monday that would reshape the military, includinggutting the military’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and reinstating service members with backpay who were discharged for refusing to get vaccinated from Covid-19. One executive order directed the Pentagon to come up with a policy around transgender members in the US armed forces. It does not yet ban trans soldiers. Trump also signed an executive order on Monday that would begin the process of creating a “next-generation” missile defense shield, which the administration is referring to as the American Iron Dome. A judge has dropped restrictions that barred the former leader of the far-right Oath Keepers group, Stewart Rhodes, from entering Washington DC and the US Capitol. USdistrict judge Amit Mehtalifted his order after finding that Trump’s decision to cut short their prison sentences also released them from a term of court supervision. Rhodes and his co-defendants were released from prison last week as part of Trump’s order granting clemency to all nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack on the Capitol.

One of the inspector generals who was fired by Donald Trump has warned that the president’s terminations amount to a “threat to democracy”.Hannibal “Mike” Ware, the former inspector general (IG) for the Small Business Administration, spoke to MSNBC after Trump fired the inspectors general from more than a dozen federal agencies on Friday night, eliminating a critical oversight component and clearing the way for him to replace them with loyalists. Trump issued an executive order on Sunday directing federal government to override California’s water management practices if they are found to be ineffective.Trump has falsely claimed that California’s Democratic governor,Gavin Newsom, and other officials refused to provide water from the northern part of the state to fight the fires. His order directs federal agencies to “immediately take actions to override existing activities that unduly burden efforts to maximize water deliveries”. The US and Colombia pulled back from the brink of a trade war on Sundayafter the White House said the Colombians had agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants.Trump had threatened tariffs and sanctions on Colombia to punish it for earlier refusing to accept military flights carrying deportees amid his sweeping immigration crackdown, but a White House statement late on Sunday said Colombia had agreed to accept the migrants and Washington would not impose its threatened penalties. A series of immigration raids were conducted in cities over the weekend in what the “border czar”, Tom Homan, claimed was only “the beginning stages” of Trump’s promised threat to deport millions of people from the country.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)saidit had made 956 arrests on Sunday, bringing the total since Trump took office to 2,681 arrests.

The release of Deepseek AI sent US stocks plummeting on Monday as it became the most downloaded app in the US. Its capabilities were compared to the latest OpenAI model which put into question US leadership in the AI boom. American companies “need to be laser-focused on competing to win”, he said. Senate Democrats signed on to a resolution condemning Donald Trump’s decision to pardon January 6 defendants who assaulted police officers.The one-line resolution indicates: “The Senate disapproves of any pardons for individuals who were found guilty of assaulting Capitol police officers.” The Senate is expected to vote on the confirmation of the billionaire hedge fund managerScott Bessentas treasury secretary.On Saturday, the Senate voted 67-23 to advance Bessent’s nomination. A final vote is scheduled to take place this evening at 5.30pm ET. Staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been ordered to immediately stop engaging with the World Health Organization (WHO).The move affects critical work on influenza surveillance and disease outbreaks across the globe. Trump announced last week that the US will exit the WHO, citing what he described as a mishandling of the Covid-19 and other international health crises. Republicans in the Florida legislature delivered a significant snub tothe governor, Ron DeSantis, by abruptly halting his proposals for a crackdown on immigration in the state.Thegovernor’s goalsincluded making it a state crime for undocumented migrants to enter Florida; pressuring local authorities to join in a deportation purge, and punishing those who do not; and appointing a dedicated state “immigration officer” to liaise with the Trump administration under his personal authority. JD Vance defended some of Trump’s controversial cabinet nominations in advance of further confirmation hearings this week.Appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation, Vance said Hegseth is a “disrupter” and described Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence,Tulsi Gabbard, as being of “impeccable character, impeccable record of service, and she also is a person who I think is going to bring some trust back to the intelligence services”.

Ice had been providing daily updates on the number of arrests as part of Trump’s broader crackdown on immigrants. On Sunday, Ice arrested just under 1,000 people. In the entire fiscal year of 2024, Ice made 113,431 administrative arrests. That amounts to about 310 arrests a day, according toCNN. A Black county commissioner in Ohio dropped out of a keynote speech at a Martin Luther King Jr Day lunch after being told that he wasn’t allowed to mention diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), journalist Phil Lewis reports. Kevin Boyce, Franklin county’s first Black county commission said that two hours before he was supposed to deliver his address to a crowd at Columbus’s department of veteran affairs (VA) he was told that he wasn’t allowed to mention DEI. It was an insult,” Boyce told Lewis. “It was an insult to the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. It was an insult to my own personal journey that they asked me to talk about. How can I talk about my journey and MLK Jr without discussing diversity, equity, and inclusion, especially given the [Trump] administration’s executive order?” Read the rest ofPhil’s report here. More than 50 mostly senior-level civil servants at theUS Agency for International Development(USAid) have been placed on administrative leave, NBC Newsreportedciting former USAid officials. The leave is effective immediately.

Four Chicago immigrant rights groups are suing the Trump administrationto halt Ice raids. The groups, represented by Just Futures Law and the Civil Rights Clinic of Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, are asking for an emergency hearing to ask for a temporary restraining order against Ice. The groups allege the raids are retaliation for the city’s sanctuary policies and a violation of the first amendment. “The federal government’s plan to use Chicago-based immigration raids to quash the Sanctuary City Movement is a clear and obvious violation of the first amendment,” the filing said. Just Futures Law legal director Sejal Zota said in a press release that “sanctuary policies are fully within the law.” “Trump’s animosity towards sanctuary cities, Chicago in particular, has been on full display since his presidential campaign,” the emailed release reads. “Chicago is just one of many cities being targeted for their long, successful history in pushing for sanctuary protections for its immigrant residents and because of that, Trump is going after them.” House Oversight Committee chair James Comeris requesting the mayors of sanctuary cities – Boston, New York, Denver and Chicago – to testify on 11 February as part of an investigation into the impact sanctuary policies have on public safety. “All four major cities are sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, which is impacting public safety and the effectiveness of federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws of the United States,” the Oversight Committee X account posted on Monday.

The sweeping review, which took effect on 22 January, affects more than 1,200 courses used to train American diplomats and other foreign service personnel and stems from recent executive orders. The Foreign Service Institute, based in Arlington, Virginia, acts as the federal government’s main training institution for diplomatic personnel and other government employees involved in foreign affairs. Since returning to the White HouseDonald Trumpand his Republican allies have cracked down on DEI initiatives in government and also in corporate America. This sudden overhaul of diplomatic training materials marks one of the most significant changes to state department educational policy in recent years. Sixteen courses were immediately unpublished for “evaluation”, while over a thousand materials relating to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) have been removed from the department’s on-demand learning platform, making them inaccessible to state department employees. It is unclear which specific courses would be suspended or under review, but DEIA criteria typically include race, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, disability status and veteran status. The institute has also frozen new enrollments for an unspecified number of courses and suspended its centralized evaluation system during the review period. According to the announcement, there is indication some courses may never return to the catalog, while others could become available after revision. While not getting into details on how long the review would go on for, a state department spokesperson said the review was “ongoing” and that most diplomatic training content would “continue uninterrupted”. “Courses specifically focused on DEI training have been removed from our catalogue of courses while we review other courses for DEI content,” the spokesperson said.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The silence around my family’s collective trauma did nothing to prepare me for marriage – or divorce I’m imagining myself teaching a class on grief. “This,” I tell my young students, “is how you think your life will go.” I draw a chalk line that wends gently upward in a steady, predictable run from childhood to old age. Education, school, work, adventures, love, purpose, a peaceful death in old age. No dust, no muss, an Instagram-perfect flow. Then I glance sharply at these innocents with a look that says,Are you paying attention? “But more likely than not,” I continue, “your life will go something like this … ” The chalk screeches sharply up, then cuts a razor path down to the X-axis, rebounding in wildly erratic loops and culminating in a mad dash to death, all the way to the right. So frantic are my gestures that the chalk breaks, sending dusty fragments to the floor. Those crazy swirls hold grief, universal but often unspoken. Yet it took the sudden exit of my husband of 30 years, starry-eyed over an old girlfriend, to realize its impact – and that I had no training in moving forward under the weight of it. In my family, we simply buried grief. My mother was a soft-spoken librarian with a master’s degree, my father a career military man, a decorated veteran of 51 B-17 combat missions in the second world war. He was also an alcoholic who abused my mother relentlessly when he was home from overseas. I was the youngest of six, joining my siblings in 1959 at a rural home where terror was strangely normal. My sister’s memory of her 1960s prom day: coming home from the hair salon, our mother behind the wheel, our drunken father shooting at the car. I remember lying in bed at night, covers pulled over my head, hearing my mother scream as she was chased and beaten. The evening of the 1969 moon landing, my mother and I fled in darkness to a friend’s apartment, staying overnight until my father’s rage subsided. Another night, my brothers Michael and Scott huddled in their bedroom after hearing gunshots inside the house, believing our mom had been killed, too scared to move. Michael recalls their relief at hearing her voice in the morning – she’s alive! – and his shock at seeing the holes in the ceiling. After 30 years, and only after my father revealed he had a mistress in Japan, my mother found the courage to leave. I became a journalist and over the years interviewed many trauma survivors, including veterans. I saw how painful it was to pull on these strings of memory, so I understood why my mother never wanted to talk about the abuse, or Scott’s suicide at 22 after a breakup, or her grief around all of it. When I interviewed her in her early 80s for a family project, she said, “I grew up believing family was everything, and you all went through hard times and you were supposed to stick it out.” My childhood and the silence around our collective trauma did nothing to prepare me for marriage. I knew only that I wanted a safe harbor. Lacking a healthy model, my search parameters were “nice, doesn’t beat me”. I had not screened for alcoholism. Ten years into my marriage, I issued an ultimatum and my husband, to his credit, quit drinking and begged me to stay. Keenly aware of my own shortcomings and our marital challenges, I still saw much to be grateful for. Like my mother, for better or worse, I had staying power. In the fall of 2017, two days before a long-planned retirement trip marking my exit from the workforce, my husband announced he’d reconnected with a girlfriend from 30 years ago – a marriage counselor, no less. Thus at age 58, I became another dot inthe exponential trendknown as “gray divorce”, couples 50 and older ending their marriages. In 1990, 8.7% of divorces in the US were among that age group, according to the American Psychological Association; by 2019, the number had grown to 36%. Gone was the main witness to more than half my life, the man with whom I’d raised three children, and in his place was a fierce pain. For months I couldn’t eat, sleep or speak without crying. My divorce lawyer, of course, had seen this all before. On our first call he listened attentively, then said, “He’s been done with you for some time.” It was hard to accept. Three years in, after therapy and medication, I was still struggling. Was it normal to feel this bad for so long? Then a tarot reader unaware of my breakup suggested I write a memoir “as a pathway to healing”. Sign up toWell Actually Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life after newsletter promotion I started by doing what I knew best: interviewing people, strangers who had been dumped, about how they made it through. Kris’s husband cheated with her best friend, a woman who feigned compassion for months as Kris shared angst about her failing marriage. Ianlisted his “whole life” for saleon eBay after his wife left him for a man they met while shopping for their dream house. Wanda paid for her husband’s auto repair shop, which he turned into a secret love nest. Those interviews provided a few useful tips but mostly made me feel less alone. These people understood how it felt to see life unravel, dreams dissolve. Yet each had moved on to new lives in which joy had made a comeback. You don’t get over the grief, they agreed. You move through it – and that can take years. I finally saw that my healing was in progress, and decided to write about what helped and what didn’t as I stumbled toward a new life. I hadn’t read anything that offered the kind of encouragement I needed. The result isWhat to Do When You Get Dumped: A Guide to Unbreaking Your Heart, a graphic memoir created with my daughter Hallie, an artist who had to navigate her own grief over our family’s reconfiguration. Our book, which is much funnier than this essay, chronicles what I learned pushing through loss. I learned that transformation takes time, attention and patience. Counseling, medication and exercise helped end my depression.Familyand friends brought comfort. Meditating, gardening and spending time alone helped me find peace and balance; so did reducing distractions like TV and social media, and distancing myself from people who added to the chaos. The writing itself was also transformative. Examining these hard-to-face issues in depth made me realize that no one was coming to fix my pain. I was responsible for the next phase, free to rewrite my life’s script based on my abilities and values. In this new life, grief has become integrated, somehow, informing how I move forward in the world. I try to give the present my full attention, working to create moments of joy and connection. Lately, that means lifting my grandchildren high in the air just to hear shrieks of laughter, marveling at the hope I have for this new generation to talk more, to seek help, to feel the whole messy business of life and learn from it. Grief is part of life. It keeps its own schedule. Its lessons can help define our values, to see what truly matters and perhaps make different, better choices. Lifting the silence around grief meant I could find more compassion for myself, and the confidence to explore a healthy new relationship when that day comes. I want that for everyone who is heartbroken. Because, class, whether we are lucky enough to find it or not, we are all worthy of lasting love.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Why doubts have been raised about sustainability of US artificial intelligence boom Investors have beenfleeing US artificial intelligence stocksamid surprise at a new, cheaper but still effective alternative Chinese technology. DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company based in Hangzhou that emerged a couple of years ago from a university startup. Its stated goal is to make an artificial general intelligence – a term for a human-level intelligence that no technology firm has yet achieved. It’s not there yet, but this may be one reason why the computer scientists at DeepSeek have taken a different approach to building their AI model, with the result that it appears many times cheaper to operate than its US rivals. Another reason it appears to have taken the low-cost approach could be the fact that Chinese computer scientists have long had to work around limits to the number of computer chips that are available to them, as result of US government restrictions. The company has been quietly impressing the AI world for a while with its technical innovations, including a cost-to-performance ratio several times lower than that for models made by Meta (Llama) and OpenAI (Chat GPT). It hasn’t been making as much noise about the potential of its breakthroughs as the Silicon Valley companies. They have been pumping out product announcements for months as they become increasingly concerned to finally generate returns on their multibillion-dollar investments. But expect to see more of DeepSeek’s cheery blue whale logo as more and more people around the world download it to experiment. This is the DeepSeek AI model people are getting most excited about for now as it claims to have a performance on a par with OpenAI’s o1 model, which was released to Chat GPT users in December. On Monday it was the most popular free app downloaded on Apple’s app store in the UK and other parts of the world. This model uses a different kind of internal architecture that requires less memory use, thereby considerably reducing the computational costs of every search or interaction with the chatbot-style system. It has been praised by researchers for its ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics and coding and it appears to be producing results comparable with rivals for a fraction of the computing power. DeepSeek has said it took two months and less than $6m (£4.8m) to develop the model, although some observers caution this is likely to be an underestimate. Nevertheless it is vastly less than the billions that the Silicon Valley tech companies are spending to develop AIs and is less expensive to operate. A key character is Liang Wenfeng, who used to run a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that now funds DeepSeek. In a rare interview, hesaid: “For many years, Chinese companies are used to others doing technological innovation, while we focused on application monetisation – but this isn’t inevitable. In this wave, our starting point is not to take advantage of the opportunity to make a quick profit, but rather to reach the technical frontier and drive the development of the entire ecosystem … We believe that as the economy develops, China should gradually become a contributor instead of free-riding.” Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off big technology stocks after the news of the DeepSeek chatbot’s performance spread widely over the weekend. The timing was significant as in recent days US tech companies had pledged hundreds of billions of dollars more for investment in AI – much of which will go into building the computing infrastructure and energy sources needed, it was widely thought, to reach the goal of artificial general intelligence. DeepSeek’s performance seems to question, at least, that narrative. Nvidia is one of the companies that has gained most from the AI boom. It went from being a maker of graphics cards for video games to being the dominant maker of chips to the voraciously hungry AI industry. It has been compared to a modest trader in pickaxes and buckets in 19th-century California, which happened to be on the spot when the gold rush happened and so it became a massive supplier to the world’s richest industry. Tech companies looking sideways at DeepSeek are likely wondering whether they now need to buy as many of Nvidia’s tools. Its market value fell by $600bn on Monday. It hasn’t reached artificial general intelligence, the threshold at which AI starts to reason and which OpenAI and others in Silicon Valley are pursuing. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has cautioned that breakthrough is unlikely to be imminent. But it does seem to be doing what others can at a fraction of the cost. One possibility is that advanced AI capabilities might now be achievable without the massive amount of computational power, microchips, energy and cooling water previously thought necessary. As with all technological breakthroughs, time will help tell how consequential it actually is.",

        "content": "Follow major developments of the second Trump administration’s first 100 days, brought up to date weekly Donald Trumphas completed an extraordinary return to power as the 47th president, vowing to impose his vision and re-altering the political and cultural landscape of the nation. To keep up with the dizzying array of executive orders, directives, firings and policy changes, the Guardian will be tracking the major developments of the secondTrump administration’s first 100 days, just like we did during thefirst 100 days of Trump’s first presidencyin 2017. This story will be updated every Monday during Trump’s first 100 days. Trump announced retaliatory sanctions on Colombia after its president, Gustavo Petro, said his country would not accept deportation flights from the United States unless the Trump administration ensured the repatriated migrants were treated with “dignity that a human being deserves” and not “like criminals”. In a Truth Social post, Trump said he was imposing 25% tariffs on all Colombian goods, a travel ban and immediate visa revocations for Colombian government officials, their allies and their supporters, as well as visa sanctions on all party members, family members and supporters of the Colombian government. Also on Sunday: JD Vance endorsed immigration raids on schools, telling CBS’s Face the Nation in his first interview since taking office that he hoped they would have a “chilling effect on illegal immigrants coming to our country”. Republican senators Tom Cotton, the chairman of the intelligence committee, and Lindsey Graham urged Trump to reconsider his decision to strip security details from three members of his first administration who are under threat. Trump defended hisremoval of 15 inspectors generalof nearly every cabinet-level agency in a Friday night purge as lawmakers in both parties raised concerns about the legality of firings that first require a notice to Congress. “It’s a very common thing to do,” Trump claimed to reporters on Air Force One while traveling to Florida, although he added that he would not be firing the justice department inspector general Michael Horowitz, because he had been by impressed by Horowitz’s report that criticized the former FBI director James Comey for releasing memos that described Trump’s attempts to get him to end the criminal investigation into his then national security adviser Mike Flynn. Also on Saturday: Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One that he wanted Jordan and Egypt to house Palestinians from Gaza, adding he mentioned it during his call with the king of Jordan. Trump proposedshutting down the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying that the states could do a better job at responding to disasters, even though he lacks the power to unilaterally dissolve the agency and would need congressional action. “I think we’re going to recommend that Fema go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state,” Trump said, while he toured Asheville, North Carolina, which was devastated by the remnants ofHurricane Helenelast year. “The state should fix it.” Trump also inaccurately characterized Fema’s role, which intervenes only if a state governor requests it. Also on Friday: The Trump administration summarily fired 15 inspectors general in a late-night purge that could clear the way for Trump to install loyalists in the crucial roles on identifying fraud and working on whistleblower allegations in the government. Pete Hegseth was confirmed by the US Senate as Trump’s defense secretary in the narrowest vote for the role in the modern era. Hegseth was confirmed 51-50 with JD Vance acting as the tiebreaker after the Republican senators Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted against his nomination. A federal judgetemporarily blockedTrump’s executive order trying to end automatic citizenship for babies born on US soil, calling the attempt “blatantly unconstitutional”. The US district judge John Coughenour issued a 14-day restraining order, after siding with the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, which brought the lawsuit. Trump later said he would appeal the decision as he pushes ahead with his executive order to end birthright citizenship. Also on Thursday: John Ratcliffe was confirmed by the US Senate to be the next CIA director. The Trump administration threatened tens of thousands of federal workers with “adverse consequences” if they failed to report on colleagues who defy directives to cease diversity, equity and inclusion efforts from their agencies. The directives gave employees 10 days to report instances of efforts to continue the programs under alternative guises to a special email account to avoid disciplinary action. The warnings, based on an email template from the office of personnel management, marked a dramatic escalation of Trump’swar on diversity programsthat were introduced to reverse decades of systemic inequities. Also on Wednesday: Trump said in an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity in the Oval Office that he might withhold federal funding from cities that do not cooperate with his deportation plans. Trump’s political appointees ordered US attorneys to investigate and prosecute state and city law enforcement officials if they refused to carry out the administration’s immigration crackdown. Attorneys general from 22 states sued the Trump administration in two federal district courts to block Trump’s executive order seeking to stop children born to unauthorized immigrants on US soil from automatically becoming citizens, decrying the order as unconstitutional. The lawsuits argued that the 14th amendment is “automatic” and neither the president nor Congress has the authority to revise it. Trump’s executive order flew in the face of more than 100 years of legal precedent, the lawsuits added, and babies born in the US have long been guaranteed citizenship regardless of their parents’ immigration status. Also on Tuesday: Thebishop at Trump’s inaugural prayer serviceimplored him to “have mercy” on gay, lesbian and transgender children, as well as undocumented immigrants – which Trump told reporters he did not appreciate. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, faced new allegations that he denied from his ex-sister-in-law that his second wife once hid from him in a closet and had a safe word to call for help if she needed to get away from him. Trump wassworn inas the 47th commander in chief under the dome of the US Capitol in a made-for-television ceremony that saw him stick to the script in his official speech but unleash his true feelings in his second speech that attacked the January 6 committee as “political thugs” and the pardons Joe Biden granted the members on the panel. Meanwhile at the Capital One Arena, where Trump had his inaugural parade, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, briefly shocked the news cycle by twice doing what resembled a Hitler salute. Trump wasted no time starting his agenda to dramatically reshape the political and cultural landscape of the nation, signing executive orders at the arena and then at the White House while he gave a freewheeling commentary to reporters. The executive orders included: Pardoning more than 1,500 people convicted onJanuary 6 Capitol riotcharges Withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accords Withdrawing from the World Health Organization Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America Attempting to end birthright citizenship Preparing to investigate prosecutors who charged him Directing the justice department to not enforce the TikTok ban for 75 days",

        "content": "Union leader claims Trump-created organization is ‘corrupt’ as X owner posts vague request for applications Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has been accused by a leading labor union of an “absolutely illegal” breach of federal regulations after posting a vague request for job applications. TheTrump administration’s much-vaunted but ill-defined program to reshape the federal government announced it wasrecruiting“full-time, salaried positions” for software engineers, information security engineers and “other technology professionals” on its official website. The page was promoted by Musk on X, the social network he owns, and swiftly drew criticism from a prominent union leader. “This is an application to apply for a corrupt organization to do corrupt things,” said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees, whichrepresentsabout 110,000 federal workers. “This is definitely against federal law if they’re using it as a way to actually give someone a job or deny someone a job. It’s absolutely illegal.” Government vacancy announcements are typically required to include key information around pay, security requirements, qualifications, and the number of available roles,accordingto the office of personnel management. The Doge page does not contain such details. It includes a brief paragraph explaining that it is looking to hire “world-class talent to work long hours identifying/eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse”, and a form to submit personal details. A checkbox indicates the roles are based in Washington DC, and available only to US citizens. The office of personnel management declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Doge job posting, and allegations it violates federal laws on job postings. While Doge was initially billed as an external advisory body, anexecutive ordersigned by Trump following his inauguration revealed the existing US Digital Service would be renamed as the US Doge Service and established in the president’s executive office. Musk has been seen regularly in the White House since Trump’s return last week, including onereportedsighting at 6.30am on a coffee run. In an interview, Lenkart criticized Doge, and its claims of government inefficiency, especially given the unit’s apparent emphasis on the IT sector, which he noted plays a small, background role in the federal government. “Doge is just an excuse,” he said. “It has nothing to do with government efficiency, or all the things they claim.” Under the Obama administration, Lenkartservedas executive director of the US Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).

He argued that Doge was an effort to defund and remove regulators for business interests and billionaires, such as Musk, who also runs Tesla, the electric carmaker; and SpaceX, the rocket and satellite business. “Most of these billionaires don’t even pay taxes, so they’re not really worried about your or my tax dollars, and how efficient they are,” Lenkart claimed. “They’re just trying to get law enforcement and regulators out of the way.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "M23’s lightning advance into east DRC being supported by up to 4,000 Rwandan troops, say UN officials France is seeking western support for a UN security council resolution that names Rwanda as being behind the M23 rebel group attacks inside theDemocratic Republic of the Congo, including the surprise weekend seizure of parts of Goma, the largest city in eastern DRC. UN officials said as many as 4,000 Rwandan troops were escorting the M23 rebels. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called on “the Rwandan defence forces to stop supporting the M23 and to withdraw from the territory of the DRC”. It was his clearest statement of Rwandan responsibility for much of the violence. But practical steps to isolate the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, are not yet being openly canvassed. Similar sanctions in the past,notably in 2012, forced Rwanda to pull back when aid was slashed. The UN statement drawn up at the end of an emergency security council meeting on Sunday called for the withdrawal of “external forces” without explicitly naming Rwanda. However, it did reference a report by UN experts that highlighted the systematic presence of Rwandan forces in the DRC. The French ambassador at the UN, Nicolas de Rivière, urged the UN security council to say Rwanda’s actions were a grave threat to regional peace and security. He said “it was time to call a cat a cat”, a reference to the way in which the international community for different reasons had skirted around the issue of Rwanda’s role in arming the M23. Britain and the US in their interventions at the UN on Sunday also named Rwanda and urged Kagame to pull back. Britain,Franceand the US have all been reluctant to impose sanctions on Kagame. The UK became dependent on Rwandan goodwill when it signed an agreement for Rwanda to accept asylum seekers, but the scheme collapsed in the face of legal and political objections. France has been grateful to Rwanda for policing the Central African Republic and Mali, both former French colonies. The EU in 2023 signed a mineral pact with Rwanda. The US has rarely seenAfricaas a diplomatic priority, and one of the first steps of its new president, Donald Trump, was to freeze all aid to the continent. Yet Rwanda would be vulnerable to a coordinated aid withdrawal, since a third of Rwanda’s budget is dependent on overseas aid. William Ruto, the president of Kenya, is seeking to fill the diplomatic vacuum by calling an extraordinary summit of the East African Community, which he chairs, within 48 hours on Monday. He insisted that the DRC president, Félix Tshisekedi, and Kagame would attend, but there has been no confirmation of this. Some nations, notably Russia and China, as well as the African nations holding rotating seats on the security council, are content to issue generalised calls for restraint. Russia says the dispute is rooted in colonialism, a comprehensive critique it provides to analyse most western actions in Africa. In speaking to the security council, the DRC foreign minister, Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, rejected any history lessons, instead favouring the UN imposing sweeping economic and political sanctions on Kagame, including on all Rwandan-labelled minerals. She accused Rwanda of a “declaration of war, and no longer hiding behind diplomatic manoeuvres”, adding that it was “clear that this crisis is directly linked to the economic plunder of our country by Rwanda”. DRC diplomats are frustrated since successive UN expert reports have said that Rwanda is plundering DRC mineral wealth. Rwandan diplomats deny this, saying repeatedly that if it has a presence in the DRC, it is because it has a legitimate right to protect the Congolese Tutsi community against rebelforces. The ambassadors of Uruguay and South Africa, whose peacekeepers were recently killed by M23 forces, appealed to the security council to protect UN troops.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Lawmakers halt his planned crackdown and move on with their own proposals in ‘spirit and letter’ of Trump’s policies Republicans in the Florida legislature on Monday delivered a humiliating rebuke toRon DeSantisby shutting down the governor’s planned crackdown on immigration in the state and moving ahead with their own proposals. Lawmakers in the Florida house and senate abruptly “gaveled out” a special legislative session that DeSantis had called to seek their approval formeasures he drew upin support of Donald Trump’s hardline immigration agenda. They included the appointment of a new state “immigration officer” who would be appointed by the governor to liaise with the White House, and report directly to him. The Republican senate president, Ben Albritton, accused DeSantis of trying to usurp the legislature’s authority to write laws, and said the chambers would pursue their own immigration bill following the “spirit and letter” of the president’s immigration policies without the governor’s input. “President Trump is clearly leading from the Oval Office and has everything under control. Sometimes leadership is not about being out in front. It’s about following the leaders you trust, and I trust President Trump,” Albritton said. Trump previously praised DeSantis for calling the sessionin a poston Truth Social, but wason his golf course in Miamion Monday morning and had no immediate comment about the day’s developments. The Miami Herald said the Republican lawmakers’ action amounted to a“kneecapping” for DeSantis, who previously commanded their absolute loyalty until his failed challenge to Trump for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination. Daniel Perez, the Republican house speaker, had previously said that DeSantis’s early summoning of lawmakers to Tallahassee, and demands they approve his proposals ahead of the regular 60-day legislative session that begins next month, were “overreach”. “We have the opportunity to move both expeditiously and thoughtfully. We do not have to choose between right now and getting it right,” he said on Monday. Both Florida chambers were planning to come back into session on Monday afternoon to begin debating legislation expected to be introduced by the Republican state senator Joe Gruters, who has been avocal critic of DeSantisin the past. Under his 75-page bill, there would still be a state immigration officer, but he would report to the legislature, and not to the governor. One name floated to fill the role is Wilton Simpson, the state’s agriculture commissioner, who has been tipped as a possible successor as governor in 2028, and who has had what observers describe as an“icy” relationship with DeSantis. Among other measures, DeSantis had wanted to make it a state crime for undocumented immigrants to enter Florida; sought to pressure local authorities and law enforcement to join in deportation purges; and end in-state university tuition rates for non-citizens. He also wanted another expansion of his much-maligned unauthorized alien transport program (UATP), an “act of calculated deception” according to critics in which migrants were tricked on to buses and planes with false promises of accommodation and jobs, then dumped in Democratic states. Immigration advocates criticized the position of both DeSantis and the Florida legislature on Monday. “UnidosUS is deeply concerned by the state’s focus on immigration policies designed to posture for national political ambitions rather than address the urgent needs of Floridians,” the group’s Florida director, Jared Nordlund, said in a statement.

From our opinion desk. after newsletter promotion “[They] serve primarily as a platform for advancing extreme immigration enforcement reminiscent of the Trump administration’s policies​​ rather than being laser-focused on lowering the cost of living or increasing wages. DeSantis is choosing to ignore the economic crises he has created and is instead using the state as a testing ground for divisive immigration measures to bolster his political image.” Over the weekend, a number of raids by federal immigration authorities took place in south Florida and elsewhere across the US, with more than 950 arrested on Sunday, theMiami New Times reported. In a further act of independence on Monday, the Florida legislature voted almost unanimously to override DeSantis’s veto last year of large chunks of the state’s budget, the first such challenge to his financial authority since he took office in 2019. Among DeSantis’s cuts that angered both Democrats and Republicans was thenear-wholesale strippingof the state’s arts budget. In condemning the governor’s veto on Monday, Perez noted that over those six years, the legislature had increased funding for the executive office of the governor by 70%. “This veto was at best a misunderstanding of the importance of the appropriation, or, at worst, an attempt to threaten the independence of our separate branch of government. Whatever the rationale, this Special Session represents the first opportunity to correct this veto,” Perez said,reported by Politico. Nikki Fried, the chair of the Florida Democratic party, saidin a post on Twitter/Xthat the abrupt ending of the session and budget rebuke had delivered “a small dose of democracy”. “The Florida legislature just overrode Ron DeSantis’s veto of millions of dollars from the leg operating budget and gave him the middle finger for his BS special session call,” she wrote. This article was amended on 27 January 2025 to clarify that weekend immigration raids took place across the US, not only in south Florida.",

        "content": "New toolkit helps doctors address patients’ financial needs – a role doctors say they feel thrust into amid worsening crisis The medical debt advocacy organization Undue Medical Debt releaseda toolkitto help doctors address patients’ financial needs – a role doctors said they did not train or want, but feel thrust into amid what they see as a worsening crisis. More than 90% of Americans carry some form of health insurance. Still, an estimated41% of US adults, or more than 100 million people, alsohave medical debt– whether held on a credit card, paid off to a provider over time, borrowed from a family member or with a collections agency, surveys show. Medical debt can result from a wide array of interactions with the US health system. From patient “cost-sharing” such ashigh deductibles, to “out-of-network” care such as aground ambulance ride, toinsurance denials, to the sheer volume of appointments needed fordiseasessuch as diabetes or cancer – in many cases, the patients must pay. “The healthcare financing system is undermining that trust, and it’s something physicians have a big stake in,” said Eva Stahl, vice-president of public policy and program management at Undue Medical Debt. Since 2014, Undue Medical Debt has bought and forgiven $10bn worth of medical debt. The organization often buys debt for pennies on the dollar from debt collectors and hospitals, and then retires it. The new toolkit for doctors comes alongside the release of survey and focus group results, where doctors said they believed the medical debt crisis was worsening. Doctors in focus groups also reported that many do what they can to prevent debt, such as ordering fewer tests, but that they don’t always feel financing should be in their purview. “The top line is that the business of medicine is overshadowing what they were trained to do, and that really means people are showing up not fully understanding their insurance or veryfearful of accruing medical debt,” said Stahl. Increased scrutiny of theUS medical debt crisishas pushed some politicians to take action. In Joe Biden’s waning days in office, his administration finalized a rule thatbans credit agenciesfrom including medical debt in reports. But healthcare providers’ billing departments can still sue patients, deny care and hire aggressive debt collectors. Those outcomes, alongside impenetrable hospital and insurance bureaucracy, means many patients remain fearful of medical debt. Additionally, the Trump administration is expected tocut health insurance coveragebyshrinking government programs, which could exacerbate medical debt. In confirmation hearings, a cabinet-level nominee has expressed support for addingwork requirementsto Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, which would likely force people off the program without meaningfully increasing employment.Other reformsseek to control spending by cutting health programs. “There is this uptick in intensity that is really front and center right now,” said Stahl. “The frustration ripples through not just the clinician population, but the patient population.” Dr Karen Kinsell is a primary care doctor in rural Georgia, where the closest specialist center is five hours away in Alabama. She said patients, “not infrequently, refuse to go to the ER”, for fear of both more debt and long waits. Others have ended up on what amounts to lifelong payment plans. One of Kinsell’s patients is a widower whose wife was spent roughly a year in the hospital before she died – amassing untold debt. Unable to pay the bills, the man agreed to a payment plan, one of a number of patients, “who are on, like, a $25 a month plan for the rest of their lives … He was dutifully paying this off, what he could every month,” she said. Another pain point, though not strictly related to debt, are the cost of prescription drugs. She said many of her patients ration prescriptions – failing to take the prescribed dose. Others are unable to pick them up at all. “Pharmaceuticals are not a debt situation – they just don’t get it,” Kinsell said. “The days of [pharmacies] extending credit are way gone.” Far away from Georgia’s country roads, attending physician Dr Anand Habib at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut said: “When you start asking individuals as patients and their families about the ways in which healthcare does not meet their needs – not only medical but financial – if you seek you will find.” Habib learned about medical debt firsthand as a resident, when he got into a bike accident in San Francisco and was taken to the city’s only trauma center. Soon after, he was hit with an ambulance ride from the local fire department (his insurer said he did not obtain “prior authorization”), the entire hospital visit (which was “out-of-network”) and later the realization that, upon intake, he signed paperwork waiving the statute of limitations for a debt collection lawsuit. “It feels absurd,” Habib said. “I am providing care to people within the city of San Francisco, and also being taken to the cleaners, to the bank, simultaneously.” Among his many cases involving medical debt, Habib said he cared for a mother with breast cancer worried not about her imminent death – but freighting her children with medical bills. He said elderly patients are frequently worried, and sometimes rightly, that an ambulance ride home will end in a bill, and said he often speaks to insurance company’s “utilization review” doctors daily – arguing about whether a claim should be denied. “That person has the power to determine whether my patients are exposed to financial pecuniary and potentially poverty and medical debt,” said Habib. “That is not a system anybody would design de novo.” Habib, who has joined multiple efforts to educate physicians on medical debt, said, “Time and again, you see these issues and you realize, ‘I can either be a bystander or I can attempt to advocate’ – even if the political winds are against us.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "TV personality embeds in one of several raids in US cities in what Tom Homan says are only ‘beginning stages’ The TV personality Dr Phil joined the US border czar, Tom Homan, in a choreographed immigration raid in Chicago, one of several conducted in US cities over the weekend in what Homan claimed was only “the beginning stages” ofDonald Trump’s promised threat to deport millions of people from the country. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)saidit had made 956 arrests on Sunday, bringing the total since Trump took office to 2,681 arrests – short of the 1,200 to 1,500 daily arrests that Trump has reportedly demanded.The Washington Post reportedthat Trump’s White House has issued a directive to Ice field offices that they should make 75 arrests daily and that agency managers would be held responsible for missed targets, raising fears of indiscriminate arrest tactics. Homan said several of those apprehended had been convicted of crimes including murder and sex crimes. Coordinated raids between several law enforcement agencies including the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); Customs and Border Protection; and the US Marshals Service were confirmed inChicago, Illinois. Homan told ABC News that the administration was only “in the beginning stages” of carrying out its mass deportation plan, making public safety threats and national security threats a “priority”, but “as that aperture opens, there’ll be more arrests nationwide”. The administration has already relaxed guidelines that block arrests of individuals without legal status inschools, churches and hospitals, or near “sensitive locations”. On Monday, a group of Quaker congregations sued the Department of Homeland Security for changing its policy that prevents agents from carrying out operations in those locations. The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Maryland andfirst reported by NBC News, alleges that “the very threat of that [immigration] enforcement deters congregants from attending services, especially members of immigrant communities,” and argues that attending religious services is at the heart of the “guarantee of religious liberty”. In Chicago, where Ice confirmed it was conducting “enhanced targeted operations”, Dr Phil – the American TV mental health personality whose full name is Phil McGraw – joined an arrest operation with Homan. In a post on X, Dr Phil claimed Ice aimed to pick 270 “high-value targets” and said the agents were “not sweeping neighborhoods like people are trying to imply”. A justice department official claimed that the first arrest observed by the US acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, who also joined Homan’s publicity event, involved a person living illegally in the US who had “killed a 19-year-old woman while driving under the influence”. The immigration enforcement agency also said it made arrests outside a Home Depot in Tucson, Arizona, and in neighborhoods with Dominican immigrants in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In Denver, Colorado, federal agents reportedly arrested 41 people, including four said to be members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua, at a “makeshift nightclub” early on Sunday morning. The DEA told CBS that the immigration status of all the arrestees was “questionable” and that they hadseized drugs, weapons and cash. The detainees were handed over to Ice, according to Steffan Tubbs of the DEA’s Rocky Mountain division. The focus on Tren de Aragua, or TdA, comes after Trump made several apartment blocks in neighboring Aurora said to have been taken over by the gang a focal point for his anti-illegal immigration campaign message. Aurora city officials said last week they were seeking to close down a sixth apartment building due to gang activity. Meanwhile, Navajo Nation leaders havereportedlyexpressed concern over reports that Indigenous people belonging to their tribe as well as others had beendetainedin immigration sweeps in and around Phoenix. CNN reported at least 15 Indigenous people in Arizona and New Mexico had been stopped at their homes as well as workplaces, questioned or detained by federal agents – and asked to produce proof of citizenship, according to Navajo Nation officials. The Navajo Nation president, Buu Nygren, said his office had received reports that Navajos had had “negative, and sometimes traumatizing, experiences with federal agents targeting undocumented immigrants in the south-west”. Nygren advised Navajos to carry state-issued identification, such as a driver’s license, other picture identification, or their Certificate of Indian blood, known as a CIB. “It’s best to be prepared,” he said. “Having your state ID is crucial, and if you possess a CIB, it can provide an additional layer of reassurance.” Furthermore, a non-profit namedOperation Rainbow Bridgethat supports Navajo citizens who are victims of Medicaid fraud in Arizona has launched the Immigration Crisis Initiative to assist Indigenous people affected by federal law enforcement raids. Elsewhere, the mayor of San Jose, California, confirmed Ice agents were conducting targeted actions there. As the California news station KRONreported, the San Jose mayor, Matt Mahan, said the local police force was not involved “in any way” and he hoped Ice “remains focused on enforcement actions related to violent and serious criminals – not neighbors who are contributing and law-abiding members of our community”. The escalating federal law enforcement actions against undocumented immigrants have set up what could be a showdown between state and local officials in so-called “sanctuary cities” such as Chicago and Denver. Under “sanctuary” laws, local law enforcement is prohibited from cooperating with federal deportation actions. Homan has warned Democratic-controlled cities not to interfere with the actions. “If you don’t, get the hell out of the way,”he saidin a speech to Republicans last year. In an interview on Sunday, the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said he intended to cooperate with efforts to deport those accused of or convicted of violent crimes, but would also enforce Illinois’s own “sanctuary state” laws. “We’re going to follow the law in Illinois,” Pritzker told CNN. “We expect them to do the same, and I’m very afraid they will not follow the law.” Illinois’s senators, the Democrats Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth,also issued a statementwarning that the administration’s deportation efforts were likely to go beyond deporting criminals and instead sweep in veterans, essential workers and other people without criminal records. “We can all agree we that [we] must remove dangerous individuals who are here illegally. But the actions being taken by the Trump admin go beyond those goals,” the senators said, adding that they stood with immigrant communities and their offices “are ready to help those improperly caught up in these raids”.",

        "content": "Elizabeth Warren and fellow lawmakers slam president for not keeping promise to reduce grocery bills ‘immediately’ Democratshave challengedDonald Trumpto live up to his campaign pledge to lower food prices in ablistering letterthat tries to reverse the whirlwind narrative of his first week back in the White House by reminding voters of the agenda he ran on. After Trump dictated his agenda with an unprecedented flurry of executive orders on a multitude of themes – including immigration, DEI programs and gender-identity rights, the letter from the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Jim McGovern, a House member for the same state, criticises him for ignoring the issue he attributed his election victory to: groceries. “A majority of people who voted for you shared that inflation and the economy was the most important for them in the election,” states the letter, which is signed by 19 of the authors’ fellow congressionalDemocrats. “Instead of working to lower their grocery bills however, you have used the first week of your administration on attempting to end birthright citizenship, pardoning individuals who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, and renaming a mountain.” The letter says Trump’s priorities since his inauguration have departed from those he focused on during his campaign, in which he consistently lambasted the Biden administration over inflation, which polls showed was a salient concern with voters. “During your campaign, you repeatedly promised you would lower food prices ‘immediately’ if elected president,” it reads. “You repeatedly promised to make food more affordable for Americans. During your nomination acceptance speech at the Republican national convention you vowed to ‘drive down prices and make America affordable again … starting on day one.” The letter appeared to be an attempt to slow Trump’s early momentum, while reminding the American public that his victory overKamala Harrishad been fought and won on “the price of eggs”. On one occasion, Trump evenstood before a backdrop of supermarket itemsat a press event at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that was designed to highlight the damaging impact of high grocery bills on voters’ finances – although he quickly veered off topic and talked about other things. After the election, TrumptoldNBC’s flagship Meet the Press program: “I won on the border, I won on groceries.” In the weeks following, however, he attempted to dampen down expectations that food prices could be reduced, tellingTime: “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. Very hard.” The Democrats say they are “ready to work with” Trump if he is still committed to cutting grocery prices but say it would mean to taking action against some of the country’s biggest corporate food names, a segment of the US economy the party often depicts as in league with the president. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion “To make food more affordable, you should look to the dominant food and grocery companies that have made record profits on the backs of working families who have had to pay higher prices,” they write. The letter cites an admission in a 2023 court hearing by an executive of the grocery chain Kroge that the company had raised the price of eggs and milk significantly beyond inflation following the Covid-19 pandemic. It warns that the current avian flu outbreak could give producers and chain stores an opportunity to further limit supply and raise prices. It advocates a range of measures to lower costs, including action by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Agriculture to discourage major retailers and brands from shutting out smaller suppliers, and encouraging the Department of Justice to prosecute actors in the food and farming sectors who engage in price-fixing. The White House responded by linking Warren to what it called the “failed economic policies” of the Biden administration, which “skyrocketed inflation”. “President Trump immediately took action on day one to unleash American energy, which will drive down costs for families across the country,” Anna Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary, toldNBC.",

        "content": "Farmers in the northern Indian region used to rely on snow and glacier meltwater, but the climate crisis is disrupting the water cycle – which means new ways of storing water are needed As the Himalayan glaciers recede and water scarcity intensifies, communities in Ladakh, a high-altitude desert in northernIndia, are turning to innovative means to safeguard their future. This fragile region experiences an average annual rainfall of about100mm. Tsering Angchuk, a farmer from the village of Stase-Dho, helped build a 22-metre ice stupa for the village Traditionally, snow and glacial melt in spring have provided water for the planting season. However, rising global temperatures are increasingly disrupting the water cycle in Ladakh, threatening the livelihoods of farmers and food security in the region. Snow melts too early in the season, while glaciers have retreated to higher altitudes, often delaying their melt. The result: a prolonged dry spell in spring that often leaves farmers without the water they need to cultivate crops and threatening food security across the region. A lone figure stands before the prize-winning Shara Phuktsey ice stupa, the highest in Ladakh In 2013, Ladakhi engineer Sonam Wangchukintroduced a solution: ice stupas. These artificial cone-shaped glaciers, named after the mound-like Buddhist monuments, are designed to store winter meltwater and gradually release it during the growing season. The stupas are constructed by channelling water from higher altitudes through underground pipes. As the water is sprayed into subzero air, it freezes into towering ice formations capable of holding millions of litres of water. During the project’s inauguration in 2015, about 1,000 villagers planted more than 5,000 saplings using meltwater from the stupas, turning barren desert into cultivated land. Over the years, ice stupas have been created across numerous villages in Ladakh and plans are under way for further expansion. Middle-school student Farida Batool, along with her classmates, has helped to build several ice stupas; carpenter Phuntsok Paldan beside the stupa he built with his neighbour on the banks of the Indus in the village of Takmachik – the stupa enables local farmers to irrigate their wheat, barley, and apricots Wangchuk has emerged as a leading advocate for Ladakh’s future, pressing the Indian government to take decisive action on the climate crisis and to protect Ladakhi culture and identity. In October 2024, Wangchuk and fellow climate activistsunderwent a 15-day fast, advocating for constitutional recognition andtribal statusfor Ladakh. The fast ended only after India’s home affairs ministry promised to re-engage with Ladakhi civil society leaders and groups. Wangchuk’s activism, coupled with dozens of other Ladahki climate organisers, is emblematic of the fight to preserve precious ecosystems. The ice stupas represent more than just a practical solution for Ladahk’s water scarcity – they are powerful symbols of hope and the promise of community-led efforts to combat the challenges of a changing climate. The group of young people that built this ice stupa in the village of Gya installed a cafe in its base. They used the proceeds to take the village elders on a pilgrimage These photographs are part of theWalk of Water exhibitiontouring the world later this year",

The advance risks sparking a broader war between Rwanda and DRC and has intensified ahumanitarian crisisin the province. M23, or the March 23 Movement, is one of more than 100 armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the mineral-rich eastern DRC. It is present in North Kivu province in areas bordering Rwanda and Uganda and has more than 8,000 fighters, according to the UN. It is named after the date in 2009 of the signing of an accord between the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), a Tutsi-led rebel group, and the Congolese government to end a revolt led by the Tutsi people in eastern DRC. M23 was created in 2012 after former CNDP troops rebelled against the Congolese government, accusing it of failing to implement the 2009 agreement by integrating Tutsi fighters into the army, protecting minorities and distributing resources evenly. It says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to the DRC after taking part in the 1994 genocide that targeted Tutsis. In 2012, the militia made significant territorial gains in eastern DRC, including brieflyseizing Gomabefore withdrawing 10 days later after an agreement brokered by neighbouring nations. In a resurgence starting in 2022, the group mounted an offensive in North Kivu against DRC’s armed forces and the UN mission in the country. M23 took control of Rubaya, a key coltan mining town, last year. It makes $800,000 (£644,800) monthly in taxes on production and trade of the mineral, according to the UN. This month, the rebel group has made further territorial gains, capturing the towns of Katale, Masisi, Minova and Sake, and now the city of Goma. DRC, the UN, the US and other countries accuse neighbouring Rwanda of backing M23, which Rwanda denies. In 2022, a group UN experts said in a report that they had “solid evidence” that Rwandan soldiers had been working with M23. Last July, UN experts said in a report that 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan government forces operated with M23 in eastern DRC. There are about 11,000 peacekeepers in DRC, the majority of them in the country’s east, as part of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or Monusco. The Southern African Development Community Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or SAMIDRC, also has troops in the country. African leaders and the US have in the past brokered ceasefires. The violence in eastern DRC has compounded the problems of a country that, with more than 6 million people displaced, already has one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. South Kivu and North Kivu, both provinces in the east of the country, havemore than 4.6 millioninternally displaced people. This year alone, the conflict in eastern DRC has displaced400,000 people. Numerous cases ofexecutions, sexual violenceandother atrocitieshave been reported in the course of the recent fighting.",

        "content": "Utah nursing home resident Gideon Castro, 66, arrested and charged over death of Dawn Momohara, 16, in Honolulu Police recently arrested a 66-year-old man at a nursing home in Utah on suspicion that he murdered a girl who attended his high school inHawaiinearly five decades earlier – with modern DNA technology implicating him. Gideon Castro’s arrest came in connection with the killing of Dawn Momohara, 16, who was found dead the morning of 21 March 1977 at the campus ofMcKinley high school in Honolulu. Momohara was a sophomore at the school, according to the Honolulu police department. She had gone missing the night before she was found dead, having not returned home after telling her mother she was going to meet friends at a shopping center. Momohara’s body was discovered the next morning. She was pronounced dead at the scene, and an autopsy determined that she died of asphyxia due to strangulation. She had injuries to her neck, and a medical examiner also determined that she had sustained injuries consistent with sexual assault. The examiner classified Momohara’s death as a homicide. At anews conferenceTuesday, about 48 years after her body was discovered, Lt Deena Thoemmes of the Honolulu police department announced that – with help from authorities in Utah – Castro had been charged in Momohara’s murder and arrested. Authorities said Castro graduated from McKinley high school in 1976 and knew Momohara. In the days after the murder, Castro and his brother, William, were among the many classmates, friends, family members and acquaintances of Momohara to be interviewed by the police. At that time, neither sibling was considered a suspect. Gideon Castro had told authorities that he had met Momohara at a school dance in 1976 and had last spoken with her at a school carnival in February 1977. He said they talked for 15 minutes, and he told her that he was in the US army reserve. His brother, William Castro, told police at the time that he had met Momohara through his brother. On the day Momohara disappeared, authorities said she received a call from an unknown male before telling her mother she was going to a shopping center with friends. Two witnesses at the time also reported to authorities that they saw a man and a car near the school building the night before she was found dead. Authorities released asketchof the man and the car. But it “failed to provide any substantial leads” and authorities were unable to identify a suspect at that time. In 2019, detectives inHawaiibegan analyzing various items and samples collected from the murder scene using modern DNA testing technology. In 2020, using advanced DNA technology, the police obtained a partial genetic profile of an unidentified male from a sample taken from her shorts. Police in 2023 then said they received information suggesting that William Castro or Gideon Castro could be potential suspects – but they did not elaborate. With help from the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations, detectives located the Castro brothers and their biological children. They traveled to collect DNA samples from the adult children – and, according to the police, a DNA profile obtained from William’s child cleared him. Further tests and analysis revealed that Gideon Castro’s son was a biological child of the unidentified male whose DNA was found at the scene. And so, earlier in January, detectives traveled toUtahand obtained a DNA sample from Gideon himself, which they say matched the DNA profile from the shorts. Investigators obtained a warrant to arrest Castro. And on Tuesday morning, he was apprehended at a nursing home in Utah on a charge of second-degree murder. Authorities later reported that Castro was awaiting extradition to Honolulu. “I want to thank all the individuals and agencies that made today’s arrest possible,” Thoemmes said at Tuesday’s news conference. “Thank you all for your dedication and commitment to the tireless pursuit of justice for Dawn and the Momohara family.”",

They are in for a world of ultra-violence,” said Hafer, who served in theGreen Berets and the CIA. “JD [Vance] or Trump had said something with the new guy from Ice, like: ‘We’re going to mobilize tier one units against the cartel.’” Referring to some of the most secretive parts of the American special forces, Hafer was forecasting the next chapter in the war on drugs – actual war insideMexico, targeting the Sinaloa, Jalisco and other major narcotics-trafficking cartels with the same famed units of the war on terror. “Yes, that is a real thing,” he said. While it sounded like a scene out ofSicario, Hafer’s video garneredseveral million YouTube views. It raises the question: what would that type of combat south of the border actually cost the US? Now, it is a possible reality. In one of Donald Trump’s first executive orders on Monday, he officially designated Mexican cartels terrorist organizations, joining the likes of al-Qaida and the Islamic State (Isis) – chief adversaries in more than two decades of expensive and bloody American wars. Days later, the Pentagon followed up and announcedthe deployment of 1,500 active-duty troopsto the border. But experts say any American incursion into Mexico could come with serious repercussions and blowback. Mexican drug cartels, well-armed from the heavyflow of US weapons, unhesitatingly employ retaliatory violence, and regular Americans could be caught in the crossfire – namely, tourists in vacation hotspots like Cancún, where cartel networks are already well-defined, or the many communities on the border with Mexico. “The persistent talk of unilateral US military intervention in Mexico is dangerous,” said John P Sullivan, aformer law enforcement officerin Los Angeles and a senior fellow at theSmall Wars Journal-El Centro. Sullivan said that, from a legal standpoint,the special designationdoes not expressly direct military actions, but he noted that calling out “cartel actions and immigration as an invasion is likely a deliberate choice to allow direct military action”. The types of operations Hafer and Trump – who warned reporters thatspecial forces on Mexican soil “could happen”– were describing are the same as past missions against Isis and al-Qaida . With both groups, a mixture of elite units – such as Seal Team 6 with the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden inside Pakistan – and aerial strikes were used to pursue every level of middle- to high-ranking operative. US intelligence compiled the so-called “kill lists” of targets, and the US Special Operations Command (Socom) mostly went about ticking them off that list. The cost was in the billions of dollars and civilian deaths were commonplace, creating a legion of new recruits thatdrove the very rise of Isis itself. “While targeting cartel leadership in ‘kingpin’ operations is politically attractive, it is operationally precarious,” said Sullivan. “Often, the displacement of capos creates a leadership vacuum, triggering infighting among cartel factions vying to replace the last leader, resulting in an elevated state of violence and insecurity in the resulting quest for power and competitive control.” At least for now, a Socom contingent will not be part of Trump’s first deployment of soldiers to the southern border. “There are no Socom troops being deployed in support of this effort,” said a public affairs officer at Socom in a statement to the Guardian. Previously, Barack Obama as well as Trump had toyed with designating the cartels as terrorist groups, but reneged. In 2020, however, Trump stillsuggested missile strikes inside Mexico. Declaring total war on Mexican cartels would also implicate the very fabric of that country: narcotics trafficking is widely believed to be one of thetop employersin Mexico and contributesbillions to its economy annually. Several politicians, military officials, soldiers, police and business leaders are suspected of being on their payroll. Beyond the estimated 175,000 people working for them, cartels enjoy regional support in some areas and function as a kind of shadow, narco-state. Further, if the US military makes good on its threat against the cartels, any and all retaliations are possible from criminal syndicatesknown for the beheadingsof civilians. In the decades since 9/11, cartels have armed up –at least once via the US government. Some today boast of havingJavelin missile launchers, armored vehicles and ex-commandos in their ranks. “There is certainly a possibility that airstrikes and raids could eventually occur,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. “Cartels may retaliate by hitting soft targets such as tourists or diplomatic targets in Mexico, possibly the soldiers theTrump administrationis deploying at the shared border, or even tap networks inside the US itself.” Webber added that the cartels were keenly “studying conflicts in Ukraine[and] Syria” and some “have been improving their drone capabilities amongst other areas of operations”. “This further indicates how Mexican cartels are learning organizations,” he said. On the other hand, Sullivan wasn’t convinced there was any imminent threat to US civilians inside Mexico as of yet. “It is clear that Mexican cartels have a history of using terrorist tactics as symbolic and instrumental tools of asserting power and influencing state actions in a form of violent lobbying,” he said. “Such actions directed against American tourists are rare.” According to Sullivan, cartels have been hesitant to engage with American law enforcement in any direct way. He continued: “While cartels and gangs usually avoid direct confrontation with US law enforcement, they have a history of attacking Mexican law enforcement and judicial officials, as well as mayors, members of Mexico’s legislature and journalists.” Mexican cartels’ wanton promotion of that violence takes a page out of the Isis playbook; they are known for using social media at the local and national levels to promote snuff films of their horrific executions – all in an effort to intimidate communities and warn government forces. Telegram and WhatsApp, asthe DEA has regularly noted in its press releases, are widely used by cartels to coordinate operations and promote their strength. Some Telegram channels associated with cartel content have thousands of views and followers interacting with everything from gory kills to audio messages. “Cartels are using a number of social media platforms and messaging applications to build support, recruit and post gruesome executions to create a chill effect for journalists, politicians, informants, prosecutors and so on,” said Webber.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Discovery of H5N9 came alongside detection of the more common H5N1 on the farm, leading to 119,000 birds’ deaths The first outbreak of a rare bird flu in poultry has been detected on a duck farm inCalifornia, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) said on Monday. Authorities said the discovery of H5N9 bird flu in poultry came alongside the detection of the more common H5N1 strain on the same farm in Merced county,California, and that almost 119,000 birds on the farm had been killed since early December. “This is the first confirmed case of HPAI H5N9 in poultry in the United States,” the US Department of Agriculture said in the report to the WOAH. “The USDA animal and plant health inspection service (APHIS), in conjunction with state animal health and wildlife officials, are conducting comprehensive epidemiological investigations and enhanced surveillance in response to the HPAI related events,” it added. Highly pathogenic bird flu (HPAI) is of rising concern to epidemiologists. The US National Library of Medicine lists H5N9 as a subtype avian influenza virus. “Whether this novel H5N9 virus will cause human infections from its avian host and become a pandemic subtype is not known yet,”it warns on its website. “It is therefore imperative to assess the risk of emergence of this novel reassortant virus with potential transmissibility to public health.” Bird flu has spread around the globe in recent years, leading to the culling of hundreds of millions of poultry. It also spread to dozens of mammal species, including dairy cows in the US, and killed a person in Louisiana earlier this year. H5N1 avian flu in spreading in US cattle herds and poultry stocks, with the US Department of Agriculture reporting that more than 13,000,000 birds were affected in the last 30 days across all 50 states by the flu. H5N1 bird flu has infected or killed 136m birds since the outbreak began in 2022. That has led to rising prices for eggs. The US Bureau of Labor statistics says that in September 2023, the average price for a dozen Grade A eggs was just over $2. Now more than a year later, the data shows that price has more than doubled to $4.16 in December 2024. An avian flu outbreak at a duck farm on New York’s Long Island was reported last week with federal officials ordering the destruction of the operation’s entire 100,000 flock. The farm had been in operation since the 1640s. Bird flu outbreaks are also increasing within dairy herds, with more than 900 herds infected across the US and 67 people infected. The increases do not yet suggest that a human pandemic is inevitable, but authorities are concerned about bird flu in domestic cats. According toa study published last year in the academic journal Emerging Microbes and Infections, cat H5N1 genomes had unique mutations that could suggest “potential virus adaptation”. It found catscould“serve as mixing vessels for reassortment of avian and mammalian influenza viruses” as well as act as a “bridge” to infect other species. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) saysthat “while the current public health risk is low, CDC is watching the situation carefully and working with states to monitor people with animal exposures”.",

        "content": "Some of the most important stories published by the Guardian have come from anonymous or confidential tipoffs. If you have something sensitive to share with us, here’s how to get in touch. SecureDrop allows you to safely send us messages and documents, and to follow up with us later if you wish. All we get is what you send us, and a codename that allows us to reply to you. SecureDrop records nothing else about you. To prevent interception at our end, we decrypt what you send us on a computer that is keptcompletely offline.     On a computer that you are confident isnot being monitored, installTorBrowser. Then go totheguardian.com/securedropand follow the instructions there.     When you first visit our SecureDrop site, take a note of the passphrase that the service generates for you. This phrase allows you to come back as the same source to view replies from us and to correspond securely.  You don’t have to give us a way to contact you, but it can be useful for us to be able to do so. It can also help us if you are able to provide some background about what is in the documents, and why you think they might be of interest to us. We can correspond with you on SecureDrop, or you can use SecureDrop to confidentially provide us with other contact information.  SecureDrop is anopen source projectmanaged by theFreedom of the Press Foundation. If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a sensitive matter, look intoPGP encryption. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted. You will use a public key that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble. Your recipient – and no one else – has a corresponding private key which can unlock messages that were encrypted by their public key.     Don’t use your regular email address. Create a new email account solely for corresponding with the Guardian. Do it on a computer thatisn’t being monitored, and make sure the sign-up information you provide doesn’t tie the account back to you.  If you’re using a browser-based service such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail or GMX webmail, look intoMailvelopeorFlowCrypt(Gmail only) for encrypting messages in your browser. Two popular applications for encrypting text and documents, which you can then paste or attach to emails, areGpg4winfor Windows andGPGSuitefor Mac.  Once you have installed one of these tools you can use it to create your own PGP keys. Keep your private key and password safe and don’t store the two together.     You should encrypt your messages and attachments using both your public key and that of the person you are writing to. All being well, this means that only you and the journalist will be able to decrypt them. You can find Guardian journalists’ keys attheguardian.com/pgp.  Information carried with an email message can reveal yourIP address. If you don’t want the location you’ll send from to be traceable, connect to your email service over theTor network.  Email your encrypted material to us, along with a copy of your public key so we can reply to you also under encryption. Don’t encrypt the public key itself.  Remember to log out after sending the message. You may also wish to delete the history of the correspondence from your browser or email software.Keep your computer secure. Secure messaging apps are easy to use and the journalist is likely to see your message very quickly. They can be useful as a way to discuss what might be the best strategy for ongoing communication. But you should avoid them if you wish to remain completely anonymous or don’t want anyone to know you’re speaking to the Guardian.     Decide whether you want to do this on your normal phone or if you want to buy a less easily traceable phone for this purpose. Then install an app such asSignal(which has excellent security but requires you to disclose your phone number) orThreema. If the app has a disappearing messages feature, consider activating it so your messages self-destruct after a predetermined time. Before you use the app for anything serious, familiarise yourself with it by sending innocuous test messages to someone.     Add the Guardian investigations teams’ Signal accounts to your phone contacts:  •UK: +44 7584 640566  •US: +1 646 886 8761  •Australia: +61 490 758 250  You will then be able to message those accounts using Signal.  Please don’t phone or send ordinary text messages to those numbers. You won’t get a reply.  Check our journalists’ profile pages for other contact details. Google their name and the Guardian and you should find it. If you can’t find the right contact details for the journalist, you could message one of the above numbers using Signal and ask for your details to be passed on to the person you have in mind. Please provide a brief explanation. We have a private Secure FTP server that uses password-protected keypair authentication. We can provide you with a unique user account to upload documents. On receipt, these documents are automatically moved to an isolated environment.     Contact us using one of the other methods to let us know what you want to send us. We will provide you with a keyfile and password, plus instructions for how to access the SFTP site. You will need to install some FTP software such asCyberduckorFileZillaon a computer.Read up on computer securitybefore sending us anything.     Connect to the site and send us documents, then let us know they’ve arrived. The documents will disappear from the destination after your transmission is complete. Don’t worry: they’ve just been moved somewhere even more secure. Remember to tidy up on your computer: remove copies of files you don’t want lying around etc.    Before you get in touch, find the name of the journalist you want to speak to, and decide in advance exactly how much you want to tell us about who you are and how we can get back to you. The journalist you want may not be available when you call, so you may have to leave a message. Be prepared for that.  If you will need to share documents with us later, look at some of the other options in this guide before calling so you can tell the journalist how you’d prefer to do that.  Consider whether or not it is safe to call us from your work or home phone, or from any mobile phone that is associated with you. If you buy a pay-as-you-go sim card to call us from a new number, think carefully about where and when you buy it, and how you pay for it. And remember that mobile phone calls disclose the handset ID as well as the sim card.     Call us on one of these numbers:  •London office:+44 (0)20 3353 2000  •Sydney office:+61 (0)2 8076 8500  •New York office:+1 212 231 7762  •Washington office:+1 202 517 89042  •San Francisco office:+1 415 919 5874 If you’re not actually being followed it’s fairly unlikely that an envelope or small package will get intercepted.     Stuff can go missing in the post, so consider how bad it would be to lose the material you’re planning to send us. Can you make copies?  Think about whether or not you need to preserve your anonymity. Could the posting location give you up? How about the materials and packaging? If you’re very worried about the package being traced back to you, post it somewhere busy and make sure there is nothing memorable about your or the package’s appearance.  Mail is scanned for dangerous compounds and objects. Don’t include anything that could cause problems with delivery.
